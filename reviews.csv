" Beautiful film, but so preachy
","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",6
" A Hot Pink Mess
","Before making Barbie (2023), <a href=""/name/nm1950086/"">Greta Gerwig</a> single-handedly directed two films: <a href=""/title/tt4925292/"">Lady Bird (2017)</a> and <a href=""/title/tt3281548/"">Little Women (2019)</a>. Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.<br><br>The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by <a href=""/name/nm3053338/"">Margot Robbie</a>) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (<a href=""/name/nm0331516/"">Ryan Gosling</a>) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.<br><br>The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is <a href=""/title/tt0032138/"">The Wizard of Oz (1939)</a> journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.<br><br>If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of <a href=""/title/tt0120382/"">The Truman Show (1998)</a> or <a href=""/title/tt0420223/"">Stranger Than Fiction (2006)</a>. Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (<a href=""/name/nm1065229/"">America Ferrera</a>), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (<a href=""/name/nm7567556/"">Ariana Greenblatt</a>) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.<br><br>Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.<br><br>Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.<br><br>If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.",6
" 3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.
","The first reason to go see it:<br><br>It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.<br><br>Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.<br><br>The second reason to go see it:<br><br>It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.<br><br>The third and best reason to go see it:<br><br>I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!<br><br>They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!<br><br>The only reason AGAINST seeing it:<br><br>If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.<br><br>Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!",7
" As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that's ok.
","As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.",10
" Too heavy handed
","As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.<br><br>Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are ""brainwashed"" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.<br><br>The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?<br><br>The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.<br><br>What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.",6
" Well this really did come as a surprise.
","It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.<br><br>Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.<br><br>Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.<br><br>I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.<br><br>Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.<br><br>Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.<br><br>8/10.",8
" My mom and I saw this yesterday. Here are my thoughts.
","I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.<br><br>I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.<br><br>There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.<br><br>The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.<br><br>There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.<br><br>There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.<br><br>The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.<br><br>I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.<br><br>This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.",6
" It was depressing
","I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.<br><br>I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.",8
" Brilliant observations, but social depth is missing
","Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.<br><br>Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.<br><br>Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.<br><br>Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.<br><br>Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.",6
" The marketing was more entertaining than the actual movie
","I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.<br><br>Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.<br><br>I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term ""Marvel speak."" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: ""You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!""<br><br>The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.<br><br>And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.<br><br>It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.",4
" Barbie Is A Weirdly Fun Movie!
","8.5/10
While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",8
" Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.
","The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.<br><br>The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.<br><br>What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.",6
" Not what I Expected
","I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.",5
" A Technicolor Dream
","Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.<br><br>The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.<br><br>I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?<br><br>Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.",9
" OVERHYPED
","This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.<br><br>I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!",6
" Fun and surprisingly touching
","I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.<br><br>Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.<br><br>Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.<br><br>Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.",8
" Strong Start... and That's It
","I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""<br><br>The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.<br><br>When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.<br><br>I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.<br><br>However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.<br><br>Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.<br><br>Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.<br><br>If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.<br><br>But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6
" Ken out of ten
","Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.",10
" It could have been so much better...
","The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.<br><br>Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.<br><br>Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.<br><br>It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.",6
" Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.
","Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3
" You are Kenough
","This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.<br><br>There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.<br><br>I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.",8
" Amazing Cast & Set, but the political message was too strong
","I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.<br><br>The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism &amp; how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.<br><br>( SPOILERS AHEAD )<br><br>Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men &amp; women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..",6
" Somewhat of a Jumbled Mess
","My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.<br><br>As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.<br><br>The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.<br><br>Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.<br><br>Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.<br><br>Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.<br><br>By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equality<br><br>This movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.<br><br>On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.",5
" I don't see how it was preachy
","In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.<br><br>So let's start with the actual review, Greta Gerwig seems to have found an actual legitimate story for the type of message she delivered, contrary to most criticism I didn't find the movie preachy or biased at all, I actually felt it was incredibly balanced and the message made sense considering the plot. Sometimes I do agree that these (for some reason) delicate social topics tend to be pushed into films because a lot of studio directors want to align with trends to make a few more dollars, but in this particular film I didn't felt that at all!<br><br>It's a fictional story that has the ability to tell a bit of historical context of one of the most (if not the most) famous dolls in the world and how it impacted the world culture and how it actually affected women's image with its controversial decisions.<br><br>The other aspect of this fictional story is providing perspective, of how women are perceived and treated in our society, the rooted systemic issues we tend to ignore AND with the Barbie plot device provide some fun and interesting analogy of how society would be if it was the other way around and women were the ones holding most power.<br><br>But again there's no hidden dark meaning, it's just a woman's perspective and if you think about it, even though reality change a lot considering the country where you live, it's not that ridiculous, the story is ultimately about equality and its a fun innocent approach to it.<br><br>Margot Robbie is insanely talented and its amazing to watch her portray this role, for once I am hoping that we keep the dialogue opened and stop inventing false theories .",9
" Good...not great
","""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.<br><br>The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did.",6
" An Amazingly Perfect Blend Of Social Satire & Fun
","For a film like ""Barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.<br><br>For a very basic overview, ""Barbie"" sees its titular character (played by Margot Robbie) living her stereotypically perfect life in Barbieland. Well, that is until she is plagued by those pesky intrusive thoughts of death, a flattening of her perfectly-heeled feet, and a trip to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to figure out what is going on. As it turns out, a rift has developed between Barbieland and the real world that only Stereotypical Barbie--accompanied by Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling)--can mend. But when Barbie &amp; Ken have extremely different experiences in the real world, it leads to even more messiness between the worlds that precipitates further adventure/hijinks.<br><br>In terms of plot, somehow Gerwig manages to write and direct her way into the perfect tone with ""Barbie"". A mere mention of the term ""patriarchy"" in today's polarized landscape will more often than not lead to a line in the sand that neither side will cross, yet Gerwig perfectly examines and satirizes the subject by making the proceedings just so darn fun. Much like, say, Jordan Peele before her did with horror flicks like ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", Gerwig uses a genre other than straight-up drama to get her satire and story themes across here. Sometimes, that proves to be the best ""delivery service"" and it is certainly true in this case.<br><br>Of course, solid/unique actors are required to carry out this quirky film's shenanigans and softer moments, and ""Barbie"" comes up aces in that department too. Robbie is perfectly cast as the lead, with both her beauty and dramatic acting chops lending themselves to the film's own dual nature. But more often than not it is Gosling who steals the show every time he's on screen. To do what Gerwig wants to do with ""Barbie"", the Ken role has to be perfect--and is here in the versatile style of Gosling (one of Hollywood's most underappreciated acting talents). The rest of the cast is also filled with solid performances and wonderfully fun cameos.<br><br>""Barbie"" is just as much a visual treat as anything else--they didn't short the area of pink paint for no reason. DP Rodrigo Pieto creates a universe that is a sight to behold in every frame and then transitions some of those characters into a real-world environment with similar panache. All of this is of course given some drive by a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and even Gosling himself!<br><br>Not only do I feel that ""Barbie"" eclipsed (even if narrowly in some cases) the bigger blockbusters like ""The Flash"", ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 1"", &amp; ""Oppenheimer"", but it subsequently vaulted Gerwig into the upper echelon of my must-see writers/directors (alongside Nolan, Villeneuve, Peele, etc.). After not knowing exactly what to expect from this film going in, I was utterly blown away by this experience.",10
" No Direction
","The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.",6
" ""Barbie"" - A Multifaceted Exploration of Femininity, Consumerism, and Existentialism
","I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.<br><br>Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:<br><br>In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.<br><br>With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.<br><br>Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.<br><br>Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?<br><br>Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.<br><br>In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",8
" Didn't hit my pink spot
","My Review - Barbie
In Cinemas now
My Rating 6.5/10<br><br>I've been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I'm a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig's work.<br><br>I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I'd love it or a huge disappointment and I'd loathe it in other words no in between for me.<br><br>How ever that's not the case I didn't love it and I didn't loathe it I have to accept that I
just didn't get it ?<br><br>Perhaps it's because that I'm a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .<br><br>Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won't see Barbie.<br><br>The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn't and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.<br><br>No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken's behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.<br><br>Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?<br><br>Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?<br><br>Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.<br><br>Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it's popular for the creators of the movie I'm left puzzled at what audience it's aimed at ?<br><br>The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn't see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .<br><br>I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.<br><br>I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric's 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .<br><br>It's one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.<br><br>Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .<br><br>Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig's clever perhaps to clever script.<br><br>Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.<br><br>Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.<br><br>Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying ""that the film's aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences ""the thing you didn't know you wanted.<br><br>I'm not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn't reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn't know I wanted wasn't what I wanted at all.<br><br>Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named ""Techni-Barbie,"" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It's a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,",6
" Preacher Barbie?
","I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It's preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can't we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end. By the time they were talking about ordinary Barbie, all I could think was ""Sanctimonious Barbie.""",4
" Now I am become Barbie Girl, the enjoyer of Barbie worlds
","I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?<br><br>Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.<br><br>Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.",9
" Misleading.
","I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.",6
" This movie tries to be too much
","I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.<br><br>All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.<br><br>I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.<br><br>I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.<br><br>I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.<br><br>Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.",4
" The best version of itself
","Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.<br><br>Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.<br><br>Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.<br><br>Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.<br><br>America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.<br><br>Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.<br><br>The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. Like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly.",10
" Fun film whose script falls in on itself
","Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.<br><br>While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.<br><br>The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.<br><br>The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.<br><br>Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6
" not for everyone
","This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me? I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.",8
" Quite disappointing
","Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.",6
" I am Kenough
","So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.<br><br>So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbieland. She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again. Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN, Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world, he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy, which leads to many events.<br><br>The movie overall is actually quite funny, Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me, he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all !! Margott is also great, she brings a range to Barbie, for me also Weird Barbie was great, she was funny and brought a difference.<br><br>There were times I felt the ""woman power"" thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie, I feel like the movie had that message and didn't need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch, the daughter was also just annoying hahaha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla, she just had no redeeming qualities, otherwise no complains and I do think it's worth seeing, solid 8/10.",8
" Too overrated
","Its like watching at ""Truman's show"" but all the set it's pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas. I grew up with barbie dolls and I felt very disappointed, I was expecting a different kind of story, the ending was the worst. I think the message should be more with the real feminist concept of Simone de Bouvoir, we all deserve the same rights. In the end Instead of just Barbie Land they should changed as; Barbie and Ken Land.<br><br>Definitely is not the best movie of Greta.<br><br>I enjoyed the music, the set and loved the clothes. Although I excepted to hear the Aqua song! Why it wasn't played in the movie.<br><br>Anyway its not a bad movie, it's just good movie.",6
" Preach Preach Preach
","Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)
I can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the ""not taking itself serious"" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.",5
" It's like G.I Joe...For girls! Seriously, and I love it for that!
","I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!<br><br>I was a little bit nervous when I heard this was not going to be an in-universe thing and that Barbie would enter the real world, but that was a great story.<br><br>The real-life story did give the art direction the purpose of making a ""BarbieLand"" with life size dream houses even I wanted to live in. The film just looks really good.<br><br>Give praise to director Greta Gerwig because this movie is fun but there were a lot of deep life cuts and the balance between the two was perfect.<br><br>It was good hands down.",8
" Barbie land and reality
","Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.",6
" Funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second one
","I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.<br><br>Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.<br><br>Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity:
* some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.<br><br>* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""Barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.<br><br>* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed ""Birds of Prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.<br><br>In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the ""Barbie"" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. And so, even if I didn't like it I'd suggest you to watch ""Barbie"" and discuss of it with your families and friends!",4
" What A Film! I Was Ecstatic About Seeing Barbie And It Definitely Exceeded My Expectations By Far.
","What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.<br><br>The film starts with showing the origin of Barbie in 1959. It explains how little girls used to play with baby dolls and commonly acted as their mothers, but wanted a doll that they could really play with instead of taking care of. And that's how Barbie came about. Then we see the beautiful Barbie world where every Barbie is a part of something. We see Barbie doctors, Barbie novelists, Barbie astronauts, Barbie everything! And in Barbie's world every day is perfect. The star of the show Margot Robbie plays ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and she starts to notice strange things happening to her. She has to visit the real world to see who was playing with her to discover why these strange things are happening. The rest of the film is about Barbie trying to find herself and discovering scary aspects of the real world that she was blinded by before.<br><br>There was so much love put into this film and you can really see that on screen. The comedy in this film is so on point that the whole theater was laughing when I went to see this film. Huge kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, writers of this incredible screenplay. The script is pure genius; I love how the film really honors Barbie and what she was made for. The cast of this film is exceptional. Margot Robbie was originally producing the film until she was cast as Barbie. Margot is the perfect Barbie; she plays this role so well she is like a real-life Barbie on screen. The way she embodies Barbie is just so perfect. I was really excited to see Ryan Gosling as Ken since he's one of my favorite actors. There's a lot of controversy as to why Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken but he makes perfect sense. He plays Ken so well he really nails what it means to be Ken in this film. America Ferrera plays a Mom named Gloria and she is such an interesting character. She plays a mom who's going through struggles of just being a woman and I'm sure her character will speak to so many mothers. It would be a crime to not talk about the insane set. Funny enough, Greta Gerwig used so much pink paint for this set that it actually drained an entire company's supply. The Barbie world is exactly as you'd expect it -- from Barbie dream-houses to Barbie beaches -- everything looks like it came right out of a toy store. Rodrigo Prieto shot this film and the cinematography is extraordinary. As someone who grew up with Barbie, this film really speaks to me. I am in love with the score of this film. Billie Eilish's ""What was I made for"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. This film is packed with so many great artists like Tame Impalla, Lizzo, Dua Lipa and many others.<br><br>The film is packed with so many messages. I was surprised with how many topics this film covers -- what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, what it's like to grow up in today's society, what is love, and so much more. This film is a celebration of women and girlhood but I also love how it represents men. Ken is discovering how men are viewed in today's society in a similar way to how Barbie is discovering who she is.<br><br>I give Barbie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. By Zoe C. KIDS FIRST!",10
" Not so unique as expected
","The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.<br><br>It started off quite funny, but after 45 minutes or so, the movie went in a direction I did not like. It took itself a bit too serious. I would have preferred a more lighthearted movie.<br><br>Ryan Gosling did the best job out of everyone playing Ken I thought. The perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy, girly and insecure. Job well done, especially toward the end.<br><br>If you are a fan of Barbie, you will probably get your money's worth.",6
" A wholesome delight!
","Barbie is based on Mattel's iconic plastic dolls of the same name. Barbie(Margot Robbie) lives a very happy life in Barbie Land, along with her fellow Barbies, Ken(Ryan Gosling) &amp; his fellow Kens. Suddenly, Barbie goes through an existential crisis that makes her question Barbie Land &amp; the truth of her existence.<br><br>Barbie is a phenomenal film. Director Greta Gerwig has given us a movie that is a tribute to everyone who used to play with Barbie dolls during their childhood, while also making fun of all the tropes of Barbie dolls &amp; Ken dolls. This film is hilarious, with a few emotional scenes that will make you tear up &amp; a beautiful message at the end. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is awe-inspiring. All the songs are foot-tappingly flawless. The choreography is faultless. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Barbie. Robbie's multi-layered portrayal of the titular character, proves that she's the perfect choice to play Barbie. Ryan Gosling is spectacular as Ken. Gosling portrays a wide range of emotions, effortlessly. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the highlight of the movie. America Ferrera is fantastic as Gloria. Ariana Greenblatt is awesome as Sasha. Will Ferrell is hysterical as the Mattel CEO. Michael Cera is perfect as Allan. Helen Mirren is epic as the Narrator. The supporting cast is superb. Barbie is a must watch for a burst of childhood nostalgia &amp; fans of Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie &amp; Ryan Gosling. Wear a bright pink shirt, grab your friends, head to your nearest theatre, watch it on the big screen &amp; have an absolute whale of a time!",10
" This Barbie is dissapointed.
","Yes. Day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else. Ok, Barbie itself was not a creative idea, I know. And actually I didn't expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place, all in all it's ""Barbie"".<br><br>But wouldn't you agree with me in that it could have been excelled better? It totally could have been. This movie has a huge budget. Then why such a mediocre story at best? I'm not saying it was a bad movie as well, but it was just ""ok"". Just that.<br><br>Nowadays movies have become nothing else but live-actions, sequels and prequels. Now it seems like the only thing matters is to have known faces in your movie and the promotions; and creating a story and excelling it good became the least important components of a movie. Unfortunately, Barbie does not fall short in these criterias.",6
" A sheer pleasure to watch.
","Barbie (2023) -<br><br>*I wrote this review about three times and I'm afraid it's still a bit of a ramble.<br><br>I didn't go in to watching this expecting it to amaze me, but to only provide a few basic giggles. I suppose I'd thought that it would be too juvenile and aimed at teens and tweens, but actually it was very good and the more I recalled of it, the more I wanted to see it again.<br><br>There was so much nostalgia throughout this film, even for me as a gay man, who as a child learned that he needed to catch his sister in a good mood if he wanted to play Barbie with her and ultimately ended up playing with his 'Star Wars' figures a lot instead.<br><br>The little touches and the interesting special editions of the doll that popped up throughout were cleverly used and some of them easy to remember from trips to the toy shop and the times that I used to sneak in to my sisters room to play with her collection whilst she was out.<br><br>Add to that a great deal of humour in various styles and it would be hard for even the most masculine, anti-feminist not to find something to laugh at in this film, despite the fact that it took the mick out of men in general.<br><br>Yes it did make a point of empowering women of all backgrounds, which it was always going to do, but I felt that it did it without making such a harsh attack on men that the average male would feel threatened by it or take the jokes with anything but a pinch of salt and there is always the hope that some people would learn from it.<br><br>Essentially it was just parodying the way that women have been treated over the years and showing that treatment up for the stupid behaviour that it was and sadly still is by exploring how a matriarchy might effect men and the ways that they might react.<br><br>The general production of the film came across like a cross between 'Elf' (2003), 'The Lego Movie' (2014), 'Big' (1988) and so many others of that oeuvre.<br><br>All of it, but specifically Barbieland was brilliantly designed and constructed, colourful and fun, with a great soundtrack and some real laugh out loud moments, a lot of which were quite adult. And while the majority of those jokes might go over the heads of a younger audience, I could see why it was given a 12 rating. The adventure had an emotional depth that might not grip younger kids.<br><br>With regards to the cast, Margot Robbie was great in her role of stereotypical Barbie. I loved the scene where ""Ugly Betty"" (America Ferrera as Gloria) was applying Margot's make up as it seemed so ironic, but I'm afraid that Barb's leading man Ken really stole the limelight, especially with his song ""I'm Just Ken"", which has featured very heavily on my iTunes lately.<br><br>Ryan Gosling was superb as the plasticised blonde and blue eyed man, although at times I wasn't sure whether his toned abs might not actually be a plastic prosthetic, because they weren't totally natural looking.<br><br>However, I think that I've found a new appreciation for Ryan after the disaster that was 'La La Land' (2016), because he was just so good in this role. It was another irony that he stood out so much in a film about Barbie, which repeatedly referred to Ken as just an accessory.<br><br>I also loved Rhea Perlman in her casting. The usually brassy little lady seemed perfect in her role and I thought that she could have performed Helen Mirren's Narrator part as well, because, for the amount Helen actually said, it didn't really need another celebrity and Rhea's character would have leant itself to the voiceover easily.<br><br>""Weird"" Barbie, the doll who was played with too much, performed by Kate McKinnon was fantastic and an absolutely great addition to the story.<br><br>I also liked Michael Cera's character Allan, it wasn't anything very new for him, but delivered a different kind of comic relief with his subtlety and non presence.<br><br>I did however feel that Will Ferrell had some typical Ferrell moments that were a bit daft and could have been left out, but in the end even he was appropriate in his part of the ditsy Mattel CEO as well.<br><br>There really was an amalgamation of comedic stylings, which I felt would make it appealing to almost anyone.<br><br>I'm not sure that I caught all of the cameos dotted throughout, but there were some definite surprises and I looked forward to trying to spot them all when I saw it again.<br><br>I did notice that there was a lot of British actors among the cast though. At least three of them were from the TV series 'Sex Education' (2019-23).<br><br>Not that I'm saying that all those Brits were a bad thing, but it was odd that they were mostly playing Americans. I would assume that a lot of it was filmed in the UK, making it easier to use them.<br><br>Ultimately I enjoyed the inclusion of all of the British cast, 3 of whom that I've had the pleasure to work with myself.<br><br>I specifically liked Connor Swindells as Aaron Dinkins. After his roles in 'Sex Education' and 'SAS: Rogue Heroes' (2022-) I felt that this was yet another example of his diversity.<br><br>And on the topic of diversity, I really appreciated that people from all walks of life were represented in the film, but not made a fuss of or shoved in my face to prove a point that the film and Barbieland was an educated place. I spotted the Wheelchair Barbie amongst the rest, but they didn't include her in the story just to tick a box and I was glad of that, because I'm tired of films trying too hard to be politically correct and compromising the end result to achieve it. That doesn't mean that I wouldn't have been happy to see her play a key role if it had been relevant to the story of course.<br><br>On my second viewing of this one I felt that there was also a more subtle message about not taking people for granted and another about the fact that you can't stop things from changing. I think it was those ideas that mellowed out the overall strong female empowerment and equal rights message that rightly seemed to be the primary element of the film, because you couldn't help but feel for Ken, whilst also empathising with Barbie.<br><br>I also remembered that I had thought the end montage to be somewhat lacking in power and I think that was due to the clarity and rush of the images that went by. I would have liked it to have been a bit brighter and certainly visually clearer.<br><br>As a whole though it was a real pleasure to watch and left me with a smile on my face. I'm pretty sure that I will end up with it on DVD, because it was one of those films that will always make me feel a joy to watch, which I believe the world needs more of.<br><br>838.49/1000.",8
" serious Barbie
","BARBIE (2023)
Greetings again from the darkness. A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.<br><br>Ms. Gerwig co-wrote the screenplay with her real-life spouse and fellow filmmaker, Noah Baumbach (MARRIAGE STORY, 2019), and it's fascinating to see what they have produced. Whether you find the film entertaining is another matter altogether, yet we tip our cap to the strange, visually-stimulating, and thought-provoking end result. Many will go in-depth on analyzing the gender politics and feminist approach to the story; however, I'm just here to discuss this as a movie, not a movement.<br><br>Two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie stuns in the opening sequence (a tribute to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) as the original 1959 Barbie. In fact, Ms. Robbie is terrific throughout in this more-challenging-than-expected role. She's so much more than a pretty face in high heels, as she's previously proven in a risk-taking career featuring memorable turns in such films as THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), SUICIDE SQUAD (2016), I, TONYA (2017), as Sharon Tate in ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (2019), and last year's underappreciated BABYLON (2022). This time she portrays 'Stereotypical' Barbie, whose everyday is perfect in Barbieland. It's here where we meet a diverse group of Barbies featuring Issa Rae, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackey, Sharon Rooney, Dua Lip, and others. We are also introduced to Ken (two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling, terrific here), whose mood for the day is totally dependent on whether Barbie acknowledges him. An equally diverse group of Kens features Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena, Ncuti Gatwa, and others.<br><br>Barbie's paradise is rocked one day when she begins wondering about death. A trip to ""Weird Barbie"" (a kooky Kate McKinnon) lets her know that the only cure for this existential crisis is a visit to the human world, where a sad girl is playing with her doll. It's really an imaginative hook to allow the two worlds to collide. Unfortunately, only bits and pieces of the human world clicked for me (loved the rollerblading at Venice Beach). It makes sense that Barbie is shocked to discover the misogyny and patriarchy ruling the human world, but there are three other elements at play here: Ken discovering that men don't take a backseat to women in this world, and in fact, they dominate; the corporate office of Mattel plays like a slapstick cartoon with Will Ferrell as a nonsensical CEO; and the mother-daughter duo of America Ferrera as Gloria and Ariana Greenblat as Sasha. The big twist occurs in that latter sequence, and it's Ms. Ferrera who dishes out the gut punch soliloquy about what's expected of women and how they are viewed. This monologue is the lesson director Gerwig wants viewers to leave with.<br><br>Barbie's return to a much-changed Barbieland finds Ken and other Kens treating the Dreamhouse like a Frat house. See, the boys have learned how to run things their way ... and at its core, that's my main issue with the movie's theme. Empowering women is a good thing, but why did Ms. Gerwig feel the need to make everything either a win for the women or a win for the men? I have always thought equality was the goal, not dominance. It's this approach that gives the film a serious and dark undertone in a quite heavy-handed manner. Sure women enjoy having power. So do men. That's no great mystery solved, and in fact makes these obvious points somehow more obvious.<br><br>Let's talk about a few other less ominous topics. Helen Mirren delivers an admirable voiceover as the narrator, and a depressed Barbie and Ken's affinity for horses are nice touches. Two of my favorite segments are Barbie's first interaction in the human world ... a ""beautiful"" woman on a park bench played by Oscar winner Ann Roth (a renowned Costume Designer who did not handle the costumes for this film), and a conversation with Barbie inventor Ruth Handler (played by Rhea Perlman), who named the doll after her daughter. While I hold firm on my belief that the film is not especially entertaining/fun, I'll also admit the song and dance around the ""I'm Just Ken"" number was a hoot. Other than performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the star here is the Production Design from six-time Oscar nominee Sarah Greenwood. The film looks amazing, even if you might get your fill of pink by the end. Barbieland is quite a sight - it's a shame the rest of the movie didn't deliver this much fun, and instead pitted men against women.",6
" A triumph of marketing for a poorly realised story
","It's weird seeing a movie that puts gay male culture front and centre of a lesbian-free world.<br><br>This highlights the movie's sloppy construction, it doesn't know what it wants to be.<br><br>The movie starts with a homage to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey resulting in every child rejecting baby dolls. What started out as amusing is so committed to a shot-for-shot homage it becomes a sinister, disturbing message that closely matches 2001's statement of the human race discovering weapons.<br><br>A chase scene in an office makes no sense.<br><br>A key character at her kitchen table is a touching moment but the way she is found has no internal logic.<br><br>Having seen this film with various friends I noticed audiences were left cold at same points.<br><br>Why would Ken run into plastic moulded waves in an environment he lives in? One of many 'jokes' that fails to land such as the cartoon car crashes, the boardroom whisper gag among others.<br><br>The movie has some cute moments having people enact doll play.<br><br>That absence of internal logic reveals this movie has no idea what it wants to be.",4
" Surprisingly good
","I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it's a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn't where my mind was for the majority of the movie).<br><br>Overall, it's probably about as good as an official live-action Barbie movie could ever be, with Greta Gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. It's bigger in scale than her previous two films (Ladybird and Little Women, both of which I prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. It's very funny in parts, and though I guess it's sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that'll go over the heads of younger kids. ""What's a fascist?"" is something I heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.<br><br>Margot Robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. It is Barbie's movie, but Ryan Gosling's Ken often steals the film whenever he's on-screen (as the film's wrapping up, there's a fairly awkward pivot to ""oh yeah, this is Barbie's movie;"" it's even addressed in dialogue). I don't think that's a problem, because he's hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he's ever given. I also don't think his character is used ""just"" to attack men, the way I imagine some people will read into it. Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but Ken goes through one too, and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.<br><br>It's an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won't have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. Some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, I don't think all did. It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but I did expect that. And it's a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn't overpower my mind throughout most of this.",8
" Excellent marketing team.
","They really did some fantastic marketing with this movie.<br><br>It's not exactly bad. It's just mediocre. It's very pretty to look at, and some of the music is actually quite funny and fitting.<br><br>But this is nowhere near what was advertised, it's not a fun jokey movie that brought homage to old movies, some saterical jokes etc. It's that, followed by story with heaaaavy messaging, followed again by a quick joke.<br><br>However none of it is funny or interesting enough to justify its runtime. The ending in particular was very obvious and just kept going, it's so clear they want you to feel something but you don't. It's just not interesting enough with the story they out forth and how long the ""ending"" goes on for.",6
" Did I watch the same movie as everyone else lol
","While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast. I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.",3
" Barbie with a life lesson
","I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great. I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.",10
" Did I just watch a 2hr Mattel advertisement?
","BARBIE is a great example of hype over substance. It is laugh out loud at times and Gosling steals every scene he's in. The art direction is on point. What makes it tiresome is THE MESSAGE pummelled into the audience, but then were we expecting any subtly? Probably not. Ultimately my wife just thought, 'I already know this. I don't need to hear it. But maybe some women do?' I get her point. In the end it felt like we were being sold Barbie Dolls as some kind of icon of feminism. But seriously, they are a very poor example of female role models. Not surprisingly Mattel was one of the producers.",6

" Kenough
","Movies are odd sometimes. In this case, I feel like the review I would have written the second the credits rolled would've been more positive than the one I'm watching now, a couple of hours later. But, as I've had time to sit with this one, I can't help but feel my opinion on it... Diminishing.<br><br>Let's start on the positive though. This movie is fun. A lot of fun. It's funny, clever and it's trying to get a message across. The actors are all doing a fine job and while I might not have personally thought them to be perfectly cast, that doesn't take away from the fine job that they all did.<br><br>Beyond the superficial though, I think this movie starts to suffer the more and more I dig into it. I think the pacing is just a bit off. It's either going too slow or too fast, most of the time, not necessarily to a tremendous degree, but certainly a noticeable one. Then there's the whole message of the movie, which is certainly important but is something that feels like it just came too late. I don't know that we need this particular take on sex and gender roles right now. Again, not because it's not relevant, but because other things have beat this to the finish line and frankly, done it better. This is like swinging through a McDonalds to get a Barbie pink strawberry shake after having had a delicious meal already. Sure it's fun, but it's largely pointless. It's the fluff following the real deal. That's not exactly a dealbreaker, but for a film that spends so much of its time and energy on certain things, it definitely felt diminished by the fact that its really just retreading ground already walked, albeit in a shinier package. Between that and the runaway hype train on this, all the controversy and coverage it's gotten, it's hard to not walk away from this and feeling a bit disappointed.<br><br>Again, fun movie. Enjoyable movie for the most part even. It feels very much like something with superficial popularity though. Yes, it's being talked about, it's in the conversation and people are paying attention to it now but I have a very hard time imagining this having the same kind of lasting impact as other films might. And maybe that's not what it's trying to do, maybe I'm prescribing too much meaning to it, that could very well be true. But, for a movie so focused on certain things, it's hard not to draw those conclusions.",6
" Life in plastic, it's fantastic!
","It's an incredibly fun movie. Lots of laughs. Very campy over the top humour. But also surprisingly touching. My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.<br><br>The soundtrack also works really within the film. I don't know how many of them I would listen to separately. I also wouldnt be suprised if either ""Im just Ken"" or ""What was I made for?"" or both was nominated for an oscar. Speaking of oscars, I think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design, costumes, hair and makeup - because visually this movie is such a treat.<br><br>Now I dont think all aspects worked for me. I don't think the Mattel/CEO subplot was needed. There could have been another way for her to go back to Barbieland organically. I felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this ""chase scene"" didnt add much. Also, Gloria's (America Ferrera) monologue. Now, dont get me wrong I think there is a lot truth to it. But I just found it somewhat one-note. It didn't exactly blow me away as it has for others. And lastly, I undertstand the importance of having Ruth Handler featured in the movie....just a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in Mattel headquarters.<br><br>Overall, I would definitely recommend the film. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll have fun. This isn't just a movie, it is the moment.",8
" I had no expectations but was still underwhelmed
","I loved barbie growing up, and even at 42 years old I couldn't wait to go see the movie! I didn't have any expectations because I had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie that's for adults and not kids. I adored Barbieland, but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie! It got silly, had no storyline, was overly political and woke, man bashing and made men silly, and I really didn't care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crude.<br><br>The music is good, but I wasn't prepared for a musical and it became that for some unknown reason at one point.<br><br>Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show. He looked like he was having the time of his life making this movie!<br><br>Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie but it wasn't that interesting to watch and I didn't understand why she was being forced to get in the box and what would happen if she did get in.",6
" A trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes
","The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.",5
" Barbie is not a simple live action of a timeless doll
","But it is also in its smallest details, from the art direction, costumes, and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all Barbie generations and the like. A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood.",10
" Great presentation, but what point is it making?
","This is an odd movie. On the one hand the presentation of the Barbie world... and Mattel making fun of itself... is fantastic.<br><br>But on the theme / plot / moral of the story side, all I came up with is a big ""What?"". The Barbies are initially presented as real life dolls who all have vital roles in society, but in reality are scripted airheads who live the same life every day. The Kens are presented as bumbling fools who live only to grovel at the feet of the Barbies. Which is kind of how the toys really are, I guess. I can get the satire.<br><br>But then we get further into the movie, and the Kens become pompous overlords and the Barbies mysteriously, for no reason whatsoever, turn into Ken-worshippers without a real purpose of their own.<br><br>Somehow this is all supposed to represent masculine vs feminine roles in real life, but in truth don't accurately represent either. The movie presents a real world in which all men are successful and in charge and all women are subjected and repressed. While that does exist, are there no female doctors, attorneys, real estate moguls, business owners, etc etc?<br><br>The movie presents this as extremes, and doesn't really do a very good job of it. About 2/3 of the way through, I can't tell whether the movie is against sexism or promoting it. The roles of the sexes become clouded... and like so many feminist movies we've seen, men are presented as idiots and women revert Barbie World right back to its female-dominated status.<br><br>As a result although semi-brilliant in presentation, the movie is preachy, heavy-handed, bigoted, and loses the element of believe-ability and relevance. I had been told the movie is great... but because of the questionable script it's just so so.<br><br>I enjoyed it, but in the end wondered exactly what the movie was trying to say? And in the end, the Barbie doll joins the real world? What's that all about? Perhaps they had some hidden meaning there, but I'm not sure exactly what it was.<br><br>I give it 6 stars (better than mediocre) because of the sets, presentation and often enjoyable script lines, but there's a lot of head-scratching when it comes to the point this movie was actually trying to make... if any.",6
" More of a marketing flick
","The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.<br><br>Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that's it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the ""bad"" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.<br><br>The photography is good though. So the average is 5/10
It is another plainly bad movie that is trying to hide behind agenda.",5
" Creatively Brilliant
","Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer. This movie is going to make bank!",10
" Colourful, but confusing
","Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.",6
" A triumph
","I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films. I knew absolutely nothing about Barbie except that it was a doll. The trailers didn't impress me. I slept less than an hour last night. I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.<br><br>The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.<br><br>Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. The feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. It's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves.",8
" Just a little empty
","I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.",6
" Barbie Fantastic!
","The acting was amazing. Ryan Gosling should win an award for this. There was much laughter, tears, dancing, and conflict which all played out well. The acting resembled the characters as toys, down to every little detail. Phenomenal acting! The movie shows that Barbie and Ken, and the other characters have been completely thought out. The development was very deep and relates to the audience very well. The dialogue was great, too, as there was just enough of it, showing depth. Ties into the plot and theme thoroughly.<br><br>Barbie has impacted girls for many years and the movie introduces the audience to a light hearted history of it. Barbie is supposed to be perfect and experience every day at its best. But the world of Barbie the audience sees is far from perfect, and it is separated from the real world of those who actually play with her. The plot development was amazing, as Barbie goes on a mission to discover herself and save her Barbie world. In the meantime like the slogan says, ""She's everything. He's just Ken."" Ken is also having a crisis in being number two, and questions how he fits into the Barbie world. As both toys deal with their identity crises, the themes of empowerment, patriarchy, feminism, and being yourself comes into play. Other valuable life lessons are shown as well that makes this movie memorable for women and even men. The themes are powerful and heartwarming, yet raw and honest. The sound was bubbly and popping, the graphics impressed me the most. From the costumes, to the plasticity of objects, to the action everything was visually effective. The camera angles were also notable.<br><br>This movie was very upbeat and much more hilarious than I orginally anticipated. The movie resonates with what its like as they tackle the real world. The movie brings so many elements from various generations of Barbie and the audience learns about the creator and what it means to be-Barbie. As she and Ken both question their existence, the heart of the movie centers on the impact that they make towards themselves and others. With fantastic graphics, dancing and song, humor, and life lessons this movie makes it a captivating film that everyone will surely enjoy!",10
" Expected more from Greta Gerwig
","Even though I'm not the target audience for this movie, I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Gerwig's previous works but I'm disappointed.<br><br>The main problem is that the overall message isn't clear. This doesn't go to say that the movie is frivolous. What happens is that it gets lost trying to explore multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the punchline. It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy, sexism, gender roles, existencialism, imperfection, individuality and identity but always on a shallow level. Every scene in this script tries to convince you that it's saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor, which results in an immature and non-compelling production.<br><br>In contrast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be. The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too.<br><br>Hopefully Greta Gerwig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird, which I genuinely think deserves 5 stars.",6
" Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling's performances bolster a film with messaging that is heavy-handed and bordering on exhaustingly preachy most of the time
","The film opens strongly with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering compelling performances. Their star power and acting prowess add depth to the movie. However, as the film progresses and Barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world, the thin plot becomes more noticeable. Some viewers might have preferred a subtler approach to delivering the political message, as the film can be seen as overly direct, leading to a polarizing and preachy tone. This approach aligns with the directorial style and screenplay motifs commonly associated with Greta Gerwig.<br><br>The production design of Barbie Land is visually captivating, offering a feast for the eyes. The music soundtrack, featuring a standout disco track by Dua Lipa, complements the film well. Dua Lipa's cameo as Mermaid Barbie is a highlight.<br><br>The film incorporates satire and self-aware humor, which adds depth to the story. However, the humor doesn't consistently land, and some moments feel forced. The character Stereotypical Ken provides sporadic moments of humor.<br><br>In summary, 'Barbie' is a film worth watching at least once. It includes an empowerment monologue delivered by America Ferrera's character, addressing societal expectations placed on women. While there is still some double standard in gender role expectations, it is less prominent in today's society compared to the past.",4
" Perhaps I treated you too harshly
","SCORE: 9.5/10<br><br>Queue the ""Perhaps I treated you too harshly"". I've seen this movie 6 times now. That is not a mistake and it did not happen on accident. I love this movie and, yes, it's not perfect, but it is way better than I had originally scored it and continued to score it each time I rewatched it. I think on my first watch I just couldn't get over how much of the film I had already seen from the marketing. There was an overwhelming amount of the movie revealed in things leading up to the release. The story is still lacking in some areas, but this genuinely might be the most entertaining movie of all time. The music is mesmerizing, the acting performances are unbelievable, and I never want to stop rewatching it.<br><br>Also, I like to pick out new things each time I rewatch it. No one is talking about Hockey Barbie. She might have been my favorite. She is drop dead gorgeous.<br><br>ORIGINAL SCORE: 7.8/10<br><br>Letterboxd continues to be goated. The pink heart is a nice touch. Maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but could you blame me? The marketing for this movie was undoubtedly some of the best that has ever been done. The film wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but there definitely was a feeling of being underwhelmed, which has to do with a lot of things. First, because the marketing was so amazing, it felt like I had seen 75% of the movie already before stepping foot in the theater. The story is good, but I think it really struggled with straddling the line between being a social commentary and being goofy and funny. It did a decent job of both, but each side hindered the ability for the other to have maximum impact. Because of that, it led to a lot of parts feeling forced, almost in an attempt to balance out the levels at very inopportune times. The timing was slightly off and created a couple awkward stretches where you were waiting for something to be funny, but it ended up being serious for a bit too long.<br><br>With all that said, I still have a fun time with the premiere, and I'm not going to let knowing of all the good parts take away from how good they actually were. The songs were catchy, the vibes were superb, and the cast was amazing. Michael Cera as Allan and his involvement in the story was definitely a nice surprise. However, to no surprise, the stars of the show, me and Margot Robbie...I mean Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie killed it as Ken and Barbie. As a man, I thought the jabs at men were hilarious and warranted. The best type of comedy is relatable comedy, and I think they did a good job with it. The references to other movies were also cool, especially their dig at Zack Snyder's Justice League. The Film Bros are going to HATE this movie. The set pieces for this film were very impressive, and Greta Gerwig seems like an amazing human being.<br><br>My criticisms of this movie are not to be taken as me being disappointed or even that I didn't like parts of it. I think I just saw the potential this movie had and it flashed it to us occasionally, but ultimately fell short. I am happy to be living in a time where Barbenheimer is happening and we can celebrate cinema together, but I have a feeling that Oppenheimer is going to blow this thing out of the water, no pun intended. If you look at my Perfect Score Ranking, you will see that I am not shy to express my more ""feminine"" side and appreciate movies that maybe most men wouldn't. I was really expecting for this film to be a huge hit for me, but it ended up just being good. Which is okay! I definitely still recommend for people to see it, and I will be jamming to the songs of the soundtrack in my car. Well done Greta and team!",10
" Great if not ham-fisted message but a sloppy movie.
","I was pretty excited to see this film and hope I'm not going to get put on a list for saying I didn't enjoy it that much. The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.",6
" ""Barbie"" is fun and visually beautiful, but unfortunately Barbie doll was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy
","Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?"" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.<br><br>In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Truman Show""; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. ""Barbie"" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.<br><br>But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms ""Barbie"" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast ""Real Time"" in which he said: ""Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment"". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.<br><br>The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idi*ts, gr*edy, d*mb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the ""Stereotyped"" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).<br><br>The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory ""diversity and inclusion"" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be ""empowering"" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.<br><br>Ken represents the ""evil patriarchy"". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the ""toxic"" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.<br><br>All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile ""conservative fascist"". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the ""evil businessmen"" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are ""d*mb"". The Barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).<br><br>""Barbie"" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.<br><br>""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, Barbie doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. ""Who is Barbie?""",5

" Not as clever as it thinks it is
","I went into the film having high expectations, the marketing for Barbie has been really effective, I have to give them that. I had also heard good things about the movie from friends and co-workers. So I went to the cinema with my friend, dressed in pink.<br><br>I was expecting a funny, girly movie with some clever commentary on patriarchy and existentialism. Instead, I found it to be campy and over the top. Campy can be fun, and there were one or two chuckle-worthy moments. But I wouldn't describe it as a funny comedy. Maybe it's because we're from Northern Europe, but the audience certainly wasn't laughing at many moments. I recall Ryan Gosling causing a few chuckles here and there though, he's got great comedic timing.<br><br>The social commentary wasn't very subtle, the message was overly clear. It was so exaggerated that I found myself cringing at the lines and scenes. It could've been done much more elegantly, but it's clear that they didn't have high expectations of their audiences' intelligence.<br><br>But there were some highlights too, of course: Barbieland looked amazing and I loved the costume design. Ryan Gosling was lovable and funny, even as a loser Ken. Margot Robbie was convincing as Barbie. The music fit well.<br><br>Lastly, I wish I had gone into the movie without any expectations. I probably would've enjoyed it more then. It was relatively entertaining but I don't think that I'll be rewatching it. As a feminist I was disappointed in how on the nose the social commentary was. It could've been done with so much more grace and respect for the audience's intelligence. I also didn't like the way the dialogue was written over all, it was very ""wannabe-intellectual"" which I didn't find to be very funny at all. Maybe it's just the American humor that doesn't suit me.",6

Until she's not. And she's becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.<br><br>There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.<br><br>To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.<br><br>We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.<br><br>The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.<br><br>A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube.",8

","I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling.

" Mind blowing

" Honestly - no idea why people are so hyped up with this
","Honestly I really have no idea why this movie seems to be so popular. Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...",6
" Overhyped and banal
","The film does not live up to the marketing. Its about as subtle as a steamroller and deep as a puddle. There must be primary school books with more depth and nuance than this film.<br><br>The music is good and the plot moves along at pace but its like it was written by an angsty tween. ""Yay feminism"" is about as deep as the message gets and its pretty much the entire purpose and plot of the film. It doesn't offer up anything to think about, just a bubblegum world that is just a carbon copy of the toys.<br><br>With all the ""Barbenhiemer"" hype and marketing I expected more from the movie, Oppenheimer and Barbie are about as polar opposites of film-making as its possible to get.",4
" Laugh, Reflect, Repeat: Exploring the Wonders of 'Barbie'

Brace yourself to be dazzled and captivated by the delightful world of ""Barbie."" Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",10
" Barbie Land
","Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.",6
" How is this movie so popular?
","I realise that I am hardly the target audience of this movie, but even so, slogging trough the movie I am baffled as to what the appeal is? There must be something with all the money it made at the box office, right? I haven't read any other reviews yet so as not to spoil my own impression of the movie.<br><br>I've waited for the home release and I will admit, I fell asleep a couple times and am not compelled at all to rewatch the movie any time soon.<br><br>There are some visual gags and some good jokes but I felt like those kind of ran out in the first 20 minutes or so. Once you get pass the novelty of the movie, what else is there? Not much in my opinion. The only thing that could hold my interest was Ken and his subplot, but the things happening around and to Barbie I couldn't care less about. The movie didn't make me care at all about anything that happened and as such left me bored and looking at my watch. The ending scene I pretty much fast forwarded. If there was supposed to be any kind of emotional response, I detected none. Is I said, sure, I am not the target audience but the movie being so successful I expected at least something other than boredom. My only emotional response I guess is sadness, because of the inevitable copycats and sequels that will try and leech of the success of Barbie, which isn't any good in the first place.<br><br>Edit: In hindsight I reviewed my rating and gave a bit more, because days later stuff like the Mojo Dojo Casa House, or I'm just Ken just stuck with me more than I like to admit so there are memorable things and as I said, the opening of the movie is indeed fun. I still think they ran out of ideas and weren't sure how to end things and as such would be weary of a sequel given that there weren't enough ideas for a single movie IMO.",5
" A colorful love letter to human kind
","I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.",10
" A real mixed bag
","BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it's a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.",6
" Exceeds Expectations
","If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become ""You just had to be there"" moment for the Gen-Zs.<br><br>Through the medium of this film, Greta Gerwig expresses the frustrations of all women, and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy. The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon, but at the same acknowledges it's regressiveness. Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected, as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbieland, which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world. At the end, it has a beautiful message for all women.<br><br>The script is genuinely funny with bucket-load of hilarious moments and lines. Ryan Gosling brings his A-game as Ken, saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement. Ryan has basically understood the assignment. Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie, as she fits into the role to a T. You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis.<br><br>The set-design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod. The costumes of each Barbies and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately, that it bears a mention. The buildings in Barbieland have also been created with love and passion for the universe. The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience.<br><br>The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter. It is pink and completely unapologetic about it.<br><br>The soundtrack is an icing on the cake. 'I am just Ken' is still stuck on my mind, as I am penning down this review. However, I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.<br><br>In conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world.",9
" Fun, but too on the nose at times
","POSITIVES:<br><br>1) Ryan Gosling completely steals the film for me. He's hilarious, but also completely sells the emotional moments too. A great performance 2) The film had several moments that made me laugh out loud. A lot of the humour is very clever, as can be expected from these two great writers. I should also say that I think the emotional moments were written very well too, particularly Barbie and Ken's 'breakup' at the end, which I thought was the best scene in the film 3) The production design and costume design were both terrific and will probably win their respective Oscars<br><br>NEGATIVES:<br><br>1) There are multiple times where the film was far too goofy for me. Examples include the chase scene in the Mattel headquarters and the car chase scene that follows it 2) The message, whilst respectable in a way, was just far too on the nose for me at times. When it was done subtly it felt clever and interesting, but then when they just did big monologues at the end it just became too over the top 3) The film felt quite dated for me. If this had came out in the 90s or 2000s I feel like it would've been much more impactful and relevant, whereas nowadays not many kids play with Barbie dolls and the male-dominated society is nowhere near as prevalent.",7

" Great for the first 30 minutes, then not
","The trailers and marketing for the movie were so good that I was really disappointed when the movie took an odd turn after 20-30 minutes into it.<br><br>There could have been so many better turns than the one they took:
<ul><li>Barbie could have inspired the real world to be more Barbie-like (example: the movie Enchanted)</li><li>Barbie could have spent her time in the real world helping the sad girl</li><li>Barbie could have spent the whole rest of the movie in the real world figuring out who she wanted to be</li></ul><br><br>Instead it became an odd war between men and women, which in the end, ended with just as much inequality as there is in the real world but with women in power and men not even having any homes. I don't get why they went with that. The Barbie movie could have ended with equality.",6
" Great Casting: But is it Satire or Social Commentary?
","The casting for the roles is pretty well spot on. Margot Robbie is an absolute superstar and nobody would fit the role of Barbie better. I liked the little joke when Barbie says ""I'm not pretty anymore. I'm not 'stereotypical Barbie' pretty and the narrator replies "" Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point."" Even when they try to make Margot Robbie less pretty they can't really achieve it. Robbie shines with charisma every time she is on a screen and this movie is no exception. Not only is she very attractive but her acting is superb as well.<br><br>They also found perfect roles for Ryan Gosling and Will Ferrell. The roles fit their skill sets perfectly and made the best of what is overall a pretty unusual and scattered movie. The costumes in the film were also fantastic and probably helped tap into some nostalgia with people who played with Barbie's before.<br><br>The movies biggest issue in my mind was that it couldn't ever really decide what it was. This led to an inability to achieve any momentum as you aren't sure whether it's going to hit you with silly jokes that were quite funny at times or whether you were supposed to scramble through the social messaging it was also clearly trying to send. The problem is especially clear when the two blurred together. I wasn't sure whether some topics were serious social messages they are trying to advance or to simply be viewed as a joke.<br><br>The ending made it all even more confusing. I don't mind endings being preachy but it was unclear what the audience is supposed to take away from what went down.<br><br>Overall I would have preferred if the entire movie was one big comedy , but I suppose the filmmakers knew best since they're the ones raking in the cash right now. Kudos to them. Great Casting but is it Satire or Social Commentary?",4
" A really fun time
","Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was ""Oh, God."" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I'm glad I did.<br><br>The movie was as amusing as I hoped, and it didn't overly rely on tired story lines to make it entertaining. What it also had was a lot of heart. Margot Robbie is an actress that has a ton of sex appeal, but she doesn't use it. She uses her great skill as an actress to convey the story and does it very well.<br><br>What was really fun about this movie was listening to the kids in the theater responding to it and it was pretty hilarious. My daughter and I were laughing more at that than anything. It was actually a delightful surprise that added to the whole vibe of the movie.<br><br>Ryan Gosling played a goofball Ken, but he does so in a very controlled and amusing way, and you actually feel for Ken bigtime as the story moves along. He did a great job as well as the rest of the cast that made up all the Barbies and Kens.<br><br>The only thing I will say takes away from this movie is Will Ferrell. I normally find him amusing in most movies he is in, but in this one, he was completely superfluous. He added not a single laugh nor important aspect to the story line. He just was not needed in this movie.<br><br>So, if you have a daughter of any age, go see it with her and laugh. It's truly a good time.",9
" Had some good moments but that's it
","I found the movie to be refreshing, but it's far from perfect.<br><br>Ryan Gosling's performance was the best thing about the movie. His sequences were the most memorable for me, which is something I never expected myself to say. His character, Ken, also happened to be well written.<br><br>On the other hand, Barbie was a disappointing character. Margot Robbie was good enough. Even though there was nothing special about her performance, she wasn't the problem. It's just her arc was weakly written. The motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable. Her development at the end did not make sense. She wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours, during which she didn't go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end. She didn't even save the day; her owner did. It felt like Barbie was a supporting character in her own movie.<br><br>Ken stole the show for the most part. Also, the song ""I'm just Ken"" should be nominated for the academy's ""Best Original Song"" award. It's just very catchy and the transitions in the song are very creative.<br><br>The story overall could have been better.",6
" Barbie - Unspeakably Bad
","I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie-type roles.<br><br>To begin with, there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over. The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World. Then suddenly she yearns to see the ""real world."" Where did we see that storyline before? Let's see... I know... The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot.<br><br>But if that's not bad enough, we have to sit through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment, as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction.<br><br>Even the people who like it can't point to anything original in it. Where that 77% comes from is beyond me.",2
" More Than Meets The Eye
","The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored ""Barbieland"" and the myriad of outfits and ""golly-gosh"" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the ""real world"" and the much deeper themes of a women's place in a patriarchal world.<br><br>As another toy's slogan puts it, ""there's more than meets the eye"" to this film.<br><br>And one should have expected something more than just a ""surfacey-fun"" film from the Writer/Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA. Gerwing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray.<br><br>And...it works surprisingly well for adults - not so much for kids.<br><br>Margot Robbie, of course, is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie. She has the looks and the vacuous devil-may-care attitude of ""Stereotype Barbie"" and is a comfortable, pleasing entity to share this adventure with. But, with Gerwig's direction, Robbie's performance reveals, subtly, layer after layer until - at the end - we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll.<br><br>Ryan Gosling is just as strong as Barbie's counterpart, Ken. He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real, male-dominated world. The BankofMarquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that, on it's surface, appears to be a one-note joke-fest, but once the film really drives to it's point, one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this.<br><br>Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cerra, Helen Mirren (as the narrator) and America Ferrara all spark - at times - during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman (Carla on CHEERS) have a role that she could sink her teeth into.<br><br>Only Will Ferrell - as the money hungry CEO of Mattel - falls short of interesting. His character - one of the only ""real world"" characters in this film - stays stereotypical throughout the movie. He is the only complete caricature in this film...and perhaps that is on purpose.<br><br>Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Gerwig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society. It's a bold move by Gerwig and works well...unless you are a Mom that is bringing your 5 or 6 year old child to this film.<br><br>And, that is the caution to this movie. It's not, necessarily, made for the youngsters that play with Barbies. The kids will love the early going of this film, but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats, since these moments of depth will go over their heads.<br><br>A surprisingly fun...and deeper than it appears to be....film, this Barbie is a multi-level dreamhouse.<br><br>Letter Grade: A-<br><br>8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the BankofMarquis.",8
" Cute but shallow
","So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).<br><br>Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig's direction is skilful and imaginative; Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt's music is catchy and uplifting; Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. The movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting Barbie's sparkly world with the realism of the Real World. The animation breathes life into Barbie's world on screen. Amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from Ken (played by Ryan Gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as Barbie's trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by Barbie.<br><br>I had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. Throughout the story, Barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. However, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.<br><br>Barbie isn't a masterpiece. It's not a disaster, either. It's an entertaining film for kids and adults. The movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. It doesn't do so convincingly or in an original way. It left me feeling amused and bored.<br><br>Cute but shallow.",6
" The movie event of 2023 lives up to the hype
",Let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isn't from the MCU or a sequel doing so well at the box office. There is still originality out there. This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end. I can definitely see this being a movie people see over and over.<br><br>Side note: Greta Gerwig must be a fan of Sex Education - three actors end up here.,8
" Pinkland
","This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie. Anyway, I think it was a crazy and fun event, but it was a bad movie.",6
" Had me smiling all the way through
","Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).<br><br>But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me.",10
" It was good but far too preachy
","I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.",6
" Why Didn't I Love This Movie?
","Why didn't I love 'Barbie'? I mean it's a brilliantly shot film. It's got a great Ryan Gosling, a very good Margot Robbie. Its heart is in the right place; its message is a good, politically correct, one. Its pacing is fine. Its not too long. So then, what was wrong?<br><br>And the answer is (I guess) ... the story. The plot. While it's far from terrible it was also far from great. And - dare I say this? - it was at times confusing. Confusing in that I did not always understand the characters' motives. Why were these dolls thinking what they were thinking, or doing what they were doing? And yes I know we're talking about fantasy here, so we can't be, or shouldn't be, ascribing real human wants and desirers to these ... dolls. But the film's message is directed to humans, as played out through dolls, and so knowing the dolls wants and desires is not completely out of place.<br><br>Because 'Barbie Dolls' are manufactured in different kinds of outfits (nurse, pilot, soldier) the film's Barbie-Land heroine, the 'Stereotypical Barbie' (Robbie), believes that real women are equally represented in / by human society. When she learns that is not the case, she travels to the 'real-world' to (a) learn more and (b) help out. What follows is a mish-mash of Barbie-Land male dolls (Gosling) awakening to the benefits of the macho life while its female dolls acquiesce to male demands. That is, until they are awakened by the return of Barbie and some real-world friends. And real-world women's-rights lecturing.<br><br>At least I think that was what was going on. I say that because while watching the film it had nothing resembling this clarity. So I guess, consciously or otherwise, I thought about it afterward and came up with that theory.<br><br>My way of saying (a) I could very well be wrong and (b) You might come up with an altogether different interpretation.<br><br>And I guess that's the answer. Clarity or lack of. That's why I didn't love it.",5

" Way too preachy
","My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for? If you are thinking of watching something this month, choose Sound of Freedom or Mission Impossible.",4
" Everyone watch this
","Barbie<br><br>Did you grow up playing with Barbie's? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie's are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.<br><br>In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler's idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.<br><br>Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.<br><br>The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie's role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn. Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.<br><br>Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.<br><br>There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.<br><br>Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO's of company's make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.",10
" Brilliant first part, second part a bit confusing
","I loved the first part of this movie. There is a a lot of excitement, wonder, meaning and humor. The main actors are very good and it all seems to be going so well. Barbie is looking for the girl who owned her in the real world. Ken hides in the back seat and comes along. At a certain point the movie becomes a story about the patriarchy suppressing women. There are some long speeches that really do not have a lot of emotional impact. At the start of the movie Ken is a puppet in Barbie world where Barbie controls everything, then it seems like they try to make the point that men and women don't need eachother and I don't think that is right. I think the movie should have been more fair to how men and women can be a great team in stead of being individuals and at odds. All in all I liked the movie, but it could have been better. If I'm saying that because I am a man and just don't get the plights of womanhood, then I'm sorry, but my experience in my own life is that it's not easy to be a man in this world of hours, I don't believe it's the case that men have all the advantages. Ken constantly confess his love to Barbie, but the movie says that his love is not real because he doesn't own Barbie. This to me does not represent men well. When I look around in the society I live in, I don't see men who own their women. I see men and women who love eachother and want to live together and I don't see what's wrong with that. I guess it would just be too traditional if that was the conclusion in this movie.",7
" Funny, Visually Stunning, Emotional, & Engaging!
","This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!",10
" I don't get all the hype...
","This movie is many things. One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.",6
" Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers.
","Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.<br><br>The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!",9
" Great acting but why this movie?
","I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.<br><br>Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.",6
" Barbie, Swing and a Miss
","This film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character. However, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler Barbie's heels.<br><br>The script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their Barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including STEM-based jobs. She helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. Barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.<br><br>Barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. Playing with Barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.<br><br>Regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional Barbie doll. Instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. The friendships between the Barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. Rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. There's a monologue by America Ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. I thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.<br><br>In the spirit of equality, I also had high hopes this film would promote Barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). It didn't go there at all.<br><br>One aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of Barbie and Ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. It was evident that Barbie did not reciprocate Ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. The movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. Ken, was extremely co-dependent and Barbie just saw him as an accessory. Yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.<br><br>In terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. Most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. Additionally, the Ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. It came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.<br><br>Overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.<br><br>Additionally, Barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. It would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that Barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. Sure she's 'ordinary real-world' Barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. The story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.<br><br>Overall, I had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book.",5

" Bizare at most
","This movie was a big hype not only in the internet but also in the local radio and tv. This was a good reason to watch this movie. It was watched in a open place cinema.

Also think that he main scene in Barbie land was a place with plenty of plastic ware all highly magnified with real actors. She and Ken found a culture shock reaching the real world. Dialogues in the second half were quite deep giving a rather different moral then we cold expect raising the IQ of the movie until the end when barbie took a rather unexpected decision for her future life.

While it showcased catchy songs, the storyline felt clichéd, lacking depth. Margot Robbie's work for Barbie was commendable, but the overall plot failed to engage adults.

But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.<br><br>Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.<br><br>I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not. She'll find new meaning to add in whatever she does.",9
" ABUSE OF THE BARBIE
","Here's the thing.<br><br>In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie. Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then. Lovely! But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course. The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often don't make any sense at all. Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.<br><br>Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes.",6
" Barbie is a beautiful love letter to womanhood.
","Ever since I saw Lady Bird, I knew that I will love Greta and her style. It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies.",10
" Barbie
","The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn't ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. ""Stereotypical"" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha's comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha's mother Gloria (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie's self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken's friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland's previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls ""wanted to be""; she named ""Barbie"" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie's story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name ""Barbara Handler"", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi's Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable ""stereotypical"" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (""Pink"" by Lizzo, ""Dance the Night"" by Dua Lipa) (the original ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. Very good!",7
" Fun enough to like it but easily to hate for its message
",": I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.",8

","I wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't it :(<br><br>It was nothing that hasn't been done before. It didn't really say anything. I hate using the word woke, but hearing the same talking points is tiring. We understand, the patriarchy is bad. But I didn't go to this movie to be preached to.<br><br>I was hoping it would be a bit more camp. I was expecting it to be like the Barbie animated films you get, which ngl, are usually good. This was far from that.<br><br>The ending was also a bit dragged out. It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.<br><br>I didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquelle or any of Barbie's sisters apart from Skipper.<br><br>Apart from the criticism, I thought the costume design was really well executed. Margot Robbie looked fabulous at all times.",4
" A beautiful Barbie movie in 2023!!!
","Wow!!! Barbie really brought my attention in the cinemas! It made me laugh and cry at the same time. I was literally enjoying the best moments in the film, and it really is a beautiful movie, and Barbie was made for kids, but there are also not meant for kids.<br><br>Margot Robbie is brilliant for this role as Barbie, and she's the right girl for the job to portray the character, and her performance was so beautiful, and Ryan Gosling steals the show! Barbie promises one thing, and that one thing that it promises to be, is a personification, of a Barbie doll that little girls have been playing with sense she was made 80 years ago.<br><br>The movie also learns about female experience, it's also about feminism, and men needs to understand how woman feel, and truly needs to know how they feel. And I gotta say, this movie learns so well, and tells a very good story, and how well it performs in the movie.<br><br>Greta Gerwig did a fabulous job directing, and making this movie, and she earns the spotlight in filmmaking history, along with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and the rest of the Cast and Crew!<br><br>If you like Barbie, or if you don't like Barbie, then this is the movie for you to watch in the cinemas!<br><br>10/10.",10

I have daughters and both have watched this. I'm also pretty laid back to life. I encourage my children to be whatever the heck they wanna be and help them as much as I can.<br><br>Now to the movie.<br><br>For an afternoon showing, it was 2/3 full and mostly women and girls. Just an observation. But it was.<br><br>The film is fun. It's tootles along with lots of off beat moments, a great monologue near the end (got teary there), silliness and self awareness (lots of self referential humour).<br><br>My girls enjoyed it. I did too but not sure it's like 9/10 good. It's definitely enjoyable but 7/10 good.<br><br>A Barbie movie could have been really bad. Really it could have been.

He's ok. At least to me, he wasn't laugh out loud funny. There are much funnier things in this.<br><br>But it is funny and enjoyable enough.<br><br>Will Barbie dramatically change the landscape for dialogue? No, I don't think it will. It will though give pause for thought to all those who do go view it.<br><br>A good, fun movie worth paying for the entertainment.",7
" Meh. Not really all that funny
","The fact that this movie did so well proves how bad this summer is for movies. I don't see what the big deal is, it felt like a mixed bag of boredom with some entertainment. There's a few laughs, few and far between that is.<br><br>If you're interested in seeing this film I can't recommend paying your hard earned money that's required to see it in the theatres. Not to mention if you want popcorn and snacks. I recommend Wait until it's on a streaming service you already have or at your local library where you can get it for free. But like so much nonsense out there, this is not worth It.<br><br>One side note it was a pleasure to see Rhea Perlman again. She's always delightful.",5
" It's not what you think.
","I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done.",10
" Good but not for under 12's
","I saw this movie tonight and it was very entertaining but if your a parent and have young Children THEY WILL GET BORED as this is not a kids movie, it is on a higher intellectual plain than that. You could honestly say this is a movie for feminists, now thats not a bad thing as I saw it with my daughter and have always encouraged her to be whoever she wanted to be and played with Barbie when she was young (she's 23 now) .<br><br>This movie has it's moments of comedy and is well done especially when in the Barbie world and has been well thought out and written. Cast very well as the two leads carry the movie and i'm sure there will be a sequel. But remember this is not a KIDS movie.",7
" Brilliant Filmmaking
","Finally went to see what this billion-dollar-grossing film was all about and...wow...what an awesome movie. I can see why misogynistic men have spoken very loudly against it.<br><br>Was it cute? Yeah. Was it funny? Yeah. Was it full of pink and fun songs? Yeah. Was it full of a deep understanding of what women have gone through and...still go through as they try to deal with all of societies pressures...some by other women but most by the patriarchy that still want to see women living the lives they saw on TV growing up? Yeah.<br><br>I knew the movie nailed it when Barbie and Ken first arrived in the Real World at the beach and he's thrilled to be there and doesn't see the underlying violence. But Barbie does...and she said she could see violence everywhere. Pretty much the same as in real life for women in bars, in dark parking lots, on the streets in broad day light.<br><br>Lots of in jokes of the history of Barbie (I had a weird Barbie!), lots of adult themes that go over the heads of kids. (One day those little girls will grow up and understand the line ""you can't even beach yourself!"" And it will be funny.)
Probably the most thought out and in-depth analysis of the perils of women trying to have it all...even more than last year's Oscar winner 'Everything Everywhere All At Once' but I'm sure this film won't get that recognition because it's a 'kids' movie based on a toy. But 'Barbie' does a much better job.<br><br>Go see it. You won't regret it.",10
" Overhyped movie, had its moments though
","The first half was pretty enjoyable, fun, light, but it took itself too seriously by the second half. No longer allowing the talented cast, especially Gosling, to shine and make us laugh. It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat underutilized. Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.<br><br>Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me, without the laughs he gave me, it would've definitely been lower than 6/10. I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie. Some is fine, but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end. Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate, it felt forced and out of place.",6
" Barbie is the film we need right now
","I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.<br><br>This movie is so hard for me to review... because it's just SO GOOD! Like oh my god go see it right now, it's incredible, important, and so much fun! Genuinely, it's the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - it's filled with pure joy and hope! Barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! Honestly, it's pretty much a perfect film! I had a freaking blast with the movie - I loved everything it did! It's pretty much the funnest movie ever!<br><br>As I write this review and reflect on the film, I had the sudden urge to revisit Greta Gerwig's breakout directorial effort; Lady Bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice Gerwig has as a filmmaker. Having seen her take on Little Women and now Barbie, I can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! I'm super impressed with Gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. The film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. Because of her ability to do LOTS of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. She has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of Spielberg. She's easily one of the greatest of her generation. I also really love how she isn't afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. She blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! Gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! Plus, Gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. I've become a huge fan of Gerwig's work and Barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!<br><br>Greta Gerwig's work in Barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. If the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. It all starts with her, and in anyone else's hands, it all falls flat. What could've been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. No one could make this movie like her. She IS the movie.<br><br>The secret weapon of Barbie is that magic ability Gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! Don't expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the Transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. Barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. The commentary isn't heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! Like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! I just absolutely love that in a given scene I could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that I did. Scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it's very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! My god Greta Gerwig is a master! Even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! I loved it! It was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; I loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! And the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! You can really tell Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and I'm amazed Mattel and Warner Bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!<br><br>Though Barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a ""studio movie""), there are so many moments where Greta Gerwig's singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is Barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (You'll know it when you see it.) I think scenes like this show that, while Barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it's ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. And no one is excluded from that. (Men, I'm looking at you.)<br><br>I know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. But trust me, I'm a guy, and I LOVED it. I connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. This movie is for everyone. Sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. This movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! Trust me, go in with an open mind and I promise you won't be disappointed.<br><br>The film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today's world, and you really don't have to be a woman to be moved by it! The screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. It's truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! And really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. It's about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. It's about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. It's a breakdown of Barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. Gerwig wasn't afraid to rip apart the way in which Barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. Gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of Barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has Barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? Greta Gerwig almost did too good of a job for Mattel! I can't believe Mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and Barbie at times. It's just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!<br><br>And oh my god! America Ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw the film. It's one of the most profound pieces of writing I've seen in quite a while and it's delivered beautifully. Probably the part of the movie that's stuck with me the most since watching it. It's sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film's narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. And I can't even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - I know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! America Ferrera is the film's beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. No one can write a monologue like Greta Gerwig!<br><br>As I said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and I wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as I think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:<br><br>""Barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn't all pink, pleasure, and possibility. Realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. Realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.<br><br>Or, maybe there's another way. Maybe womanhood isn't all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don't have to abandon it entirely either. Maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. Revelling in our - and the world's - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy.",10
" It's alright
","""If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all""
And this was my girlfriend's statement as soon as we left the cinema.<br><br>I see it as an ok movie, occasionally very entertaining but overall chaotic, a bit cliché and even boring at times.<br><br>Solid 6/10, i've seen worse but pales in comparison to The Lego Movie and other ""nostalgic intellectual property movies"" such as Mario Bros, which can contain deep messages without ruining the whole thing as I feel Barbie did.<br><br>I have to give credit to the numerous exhilarating scenes with the Kens and the CEO, stereotyping done right IMHO.",6
" This film isn't saying what it thinks it is
","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, l'm in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",3
" Greta Gerwig has done it again
","In Greta's ""Barbie,"" the iconic doll takes on real-world problems in this comedy-meets-existential film, transforming from a seemingly superficial figure to a multi-dimensional character. Through physical and emotional challenges, Barbie discovers the true strength that comes from within, while the movie skillfully balances humor with deeper existential questions. As her journey unfolds, Barbie's exploration of empathy and self-discovery resonates profoundly with audiences, reminding them of the significance of creative freedom in cinema. The film's portrayal of Barbie's evolution from a controversial symbol to a beacon of empowerment becomes a captivating exploration of womanhood and the enduring spirit of femininity.",10
" Well played.
","For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8/10 rating. The only reason it didn't quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak.<br><br>On the plus side, there are several more things to mention. First and foremost, Barbie has attracted a very strong cast, with well respected names also in several supporting roles, and they all perform well. Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice. With her skills and her appearance, she really IS Barbie (with a brain) for almost two hours.<br><br>Director Greta Gerwig and her crew created perfect Barbieland sets, which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself.<br><br>The film had me laughing many times, and it also brought me to tears a few times. Quite impressive for a movie about a doll, I thought.<br><br>And, last but not least, the message of the movie. Already when I heard that Greta Gerwig was going to make a Barbie movie, I knew we were in for a culture clash. The fact that she went all-in was not surprising to me, but that she managed to convince Mattel to go along with her was. Kudos not only to Greta Gerwig for that, but also to Mattel. This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end, and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations. Nevertheless, this took guts on their part. Well played.",7
" Dull and disappointing story
","First of all: Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie and I also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish. Both the pink dominated Barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinion.<br><br>Unfortunately there isn't much more to the movie than that. The story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence: Neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women. That's it, that's all.<br><br>The story revolves around the word ""patriarchy"" with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween, none of which really worked for me. What's left is the empty feeling of lost potential.<br><br>The main plot element of the first few minutes, the fact that Barbie suddenly isn't perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection (that sounds interesting, right?), is almost completely ignored in favor of what I pointed out above; the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this ""perfect"" Barbieland in the first case. Yes, there's the running gag with Will Ferrell as a CEO and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best. It will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story. If you're lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mind.<br><br>Then in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical, we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues. How can anyone enjoy this? 4/10 for the style and the acting.",4
" Super fun!! The discourse around the movie is stupid
","I went and watched Barbie with my younger brother, and we both had lots of fun throughout the entire movie, even durkng the more emotional parts. The outfits, music, sets, characters, and everything are super colorful and interesting.<br><br>It does cover some topics such as the patriarchy, but in silly and goofy way, such as Ken thinking the patriarchy had to do with horses. I didn't find the movie all that political, since they did cover those topics in a way that people would still be having fun while the movie was talking about them. The acting was amazing, so was the choreography during the songs (which were also really fun), while also having a nice message at the end.<br><br>It's fun for everyone (my 10-year-old brother who has no interest in dolls says he'd give it a 9.5/10), and I definetly reccomend you go watch it!!",9
" Good but not that good.
","The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.<br><br>Ps. I find it weird that this is considered such a ""woke"" movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls ONCE. Like cmon I had a Barbie too!",6
" Big hype and the result is a mirror of today's society
","Margot Robbie had a vision, and she was the driving force to get the Barbie movie produced by none other than world-class director Greta Gerwig.<br><br>The beginning of the movie brings us back to the first trailers for the movie, when little girls discovered a new doll, the first Barbie. She was different than any other doll because she was not a baby-doll, no, she was a woman-doll; a doll which could inspire the imagination and aspiration of children.<br><br>Margot Robbie plays the main character ""stereotypical Babie"" and brings her to life in every detail and introduces us to Barbieworld with all her friends. The perfect repeated ""best day every day"" gets disrupted by unknown circumstances and ""stereotypical Barbie"" accompanied by ""her"" Ken, portrayed by Ryan Gosling go on an adventure of their lifetime to the ""real world"". The discoveries and experiences that these two make have major impacts in both worlds.<br><br>This movie is worthwhile watching for the costumes and displays as much as for the social criticism of our time. The words of Gloria's (America Ferrera) speech hit the nail on its head regarding the daily struggles of women in our modern world. This movie is a depiction of reality and a dream world. It shows the possibilities as much as the shortcomings of our times with humor and fun, a little bit of sarcasm, paired with the innocence of someone new to our reality!<br><br>Highly recommended for everyone who is not too shy to face real world struggle in a pink coated Barbie world.",9
" Fresh, Fun but deeply Flawed.
","Positives<br><br>The movie has an incredible cast. Margot Robbie fits the role of stereotypical Barbie to perfection. She not only looks like a Barbie but is able to be convincing as a doll brought to life as well as showing a great range of emotions in the latter half of the film. Ryan Gosling as Ken is another standout, he might be the funniest character in the film.<br><br>The Production crew did a fantastic job re-creating Barbie land. The set design and artwork are impeccable. While watching the movie it really feels like we are in a life-sized version of the Barbie world that children play with. The cinematography makes the movie look gorgeous. The score also fits with the movie and creates some memorable sequences.<br><br>Greta Gerwig does a great job directing the film. The movie has a unique style that makes it different from the other popcorn flicks. It has a cartoonish tone, but it is done in a fresh and new way.<br><br>The writing incorporates these elements into the story and makes it an exploration of the effects of Barbie dolls in the world. The movie does this by taking the satirical route. It has a lot of great humor and dialogue. While being faithful to the source of inspiration and I really enjoyed it.<br><br>It can also be very mature in its subject matter and has a great message for adults, especially women towards the end.<br><br>Negatives<br><br>The movie is a little over-stuffed. While I enjoyed its exploration of the positive and negative impact Barbie dolls have on the world, it also has themes about gender roles, patriarchy and more. It simply feels a lot for one film, and it doesn't come together in a cohesive way instead it gets pretty heavy-handed towards the end.<br><br>There are also a few characters who don't get the required development.<br><br>One of the plot points early in the film is that Barbie ventures into the real world and sees the differences between her own world and real world. The way they handled this idea didn't work for me. It presents the real world in a cartoonish way to prove a point, and this made the story less emotionally resonant.<br><br>When the film gets to its second half the way it explores the themes mentioned above is very mature and at times confusing. The way the narrative treats this might send the wrong message to some people. Even though this is not the movie's intention, if some people could misread what the movie is about, it means that the movie didn't make it clear, and it is a problem.<br><br>Overall<br><br>There are some great things as well as some weaker aspects to this film. Which is why I have all sorts of mixed feelings towards it. I am eager to see how it will age with time. Cinephiles should enjoy this movie as well as people who want something different in their films. Not recommended for children though.",6
" Laughed and cried so much
","It is funny, it is deep, it is nostalgic, it is not about romance, it is all the things the doll was meant to be.<br><br>The narrator states at the beginning that the reason the doll was conceived was to give girls a path different from motherhood, but somehow we ended up turning her into this shallow stereotype to crush women's self-esteem.<br><br>The movie is entertaining , it makes you laugh, has so many characters, you barely get to appreciate all of them. I don't particularly love gosling as ken, I find him too old for the role, but plays well the part.<br><br>Now the important thing about the movie is the concept. The whole idea of patriarchy being the ultimate cause for the existential crisis for both men and women is just beyond brilliant. It is light enough so you don't get an existencial crisis while watching it, but you'll leave the theater with a refreshed notion that we are all suffering due to the same problem.<br><br>That scene with the old lady is endearing, the scene where barbie and ken are explaining how they are feeling about being observed on the street is an eye opener, and ohh, that final joke! Bonus points for that ending!<br><br>Will definitely what again.",10
" Witty, funny but severly sterotypical
","A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.<br><br>The irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion. One might argue this is not the case since it is mostly Ken's that are depicted this way. But since the Ken's behaviour are supposed to reflect the human female's experiences of men in general, that argument falls flat.<br><br>In Short, enjoyable film, but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing.",6
" Barbie Drama
","The first 30 minutes of ""Barbie"" had me intrigued and entertained. With its colorful world and charming characters,The beginning was fun, light-hearted, and had that nostalgic touch that brought back fond memories.<br><br>However, as the movie progressed, it took an unexpected turn towards heavy themes of feminine power and patriarchy. While these concepts are important and relevant, they felt out of place in a Barbie movie. The shift in tone became overwhelming and overshadowed the initial enjoyment.<br><br>I wanted to love this movie, but the burden of tackling such complex ideas seemed misplaced in the Barbie universe. It lost the essence of what makes a Barbie movie special-simple yet heartwarming stories with valuable life lessons. The movie became a bit too preachy and lost its magical charm.<br><br>In the end, ""Barbie"" had the potential to be a delightful family film, but the weighty themes proved to be too much for a franchise known for its light and cheerful nature. It left me longing for the simple joy and innocent fun that Barbie movies used to bring.",5
" Deeper than I thought.
","I really thought this would just be a cute movie, but it actually had a very deep message and I really hope people can take the messages away from this movie because there was a few. I think they did great with the Barbie movie. It was entertaining. The special effects were adorable, but the message was so HUGE in this movie.<br><br>Watching these light fluffy cute reviews, I know most people missed it.<br><br>First of all, Barbie was very empowering in her own world where she could be anything she wanted and looking her best while doing it AND the men were not needed, NOT IN CHARGE and all The Ken's cared about was whether or not, they received any attention from their Barbie
Sound familiar kept wives? Trophy Wives you have no other purpose except to look incredible for your stupid rich husband. That was Ken.<br><br>The second she went into the real world. She was cat called had her ass slapped, got arrested for defending herself, and was treated with pretty privilege at the police station all while being treated like a blonde bimbo by people in the street. The complete opposite of Barbieland.<br><br>I hope that people can take away from Barbie and Ken how the roles were reversed when they went from Barbieland to the real world and you could see Barbie becoming very anxious and self-conscious, while Ken became very self-confident, felt amazing he felt empowered immediately for the first time in his life, and you could almost see him go from proud to being a man to toxic masculinity within one scene.<br><br>The teen angst was a good part too. Barbie was empowering to millions of girls but not to everybody. She has also given millions a very severe complex about body image, pretty privilege and society accepting them only if they look a certain way and Barbieland totally emphasizes that.<br><br>Even the biggest Barbie was well done up. Dresses well hair done speaks delicately.<br><br>Everyone there was picture perfect. Dainty and feminine. Even the Supreme Court were beauty pageant champions.<br><br>This movie is actually deeper than I thought it would be. It was really good I really like Margot Robbie I think she's absolutely adorable as Barbie and I felt bad for her for most of the movie because she went from being a brilliant, beautiful and inspiring idol to some cat called bimbo with pretty privilege in the real world that they wanted to just put in a box.",10
" Good Enough
","Barbie is a fun summery movie for all ages.<br><br>It tells the story of the doll Barbie who has to go into the real world to find her girl owner after she starts behaving oddly for a Barbie doll. That is the main prompt of the movie, which quickly takes a new turn all together, focusing on Ken and turning the tables on gender and how men and women are presented in films and in art in general (not to mention how their are treated in real world). That social commentary was spot on, under the light of more comical lences that makes it more appetizing and easily digestable. However, the movie does get close to being over preachy, loosing its initial main idea. That could have been solved by making the movie a little longer, giving the plot space to smoothly develop and have all those features handled in a better way. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have that, thus, the result is an overstuffy, half baked plot.<br><br>On the other hand, the performances were enjoyable, with Gosling trully shining in this one. The mood and costumes were also spot on.",6
" Playful idea about the Barbie concept that gets lost in the messy story.
","Barbie is a new fantasy comedy directed, part written and produced by Greta Gerwig, director of Lady Bird and Little Women.<br><br>In Barbieland, everything is perfect and everything runs smoothly. Yet Barbie (Margot Robbie) learns that something is not right and everything suddenly seems less than perfect for her. Because of this, she decides to travel to the real world, to find out what's going on.<br><br>On this journey she is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), who secretly tried to go with her. Together they now try to figure out what's going on, but learn that the real world is very different compared to Barbieland.<br><br>Greta Gerwig, together with the photography director Rodrigo Prieto, knows how to convey the Barbie world well, making it seem as if you are in a life-sized doll's room as a viewer. They used beautiful film sets for this. Thus, the film works well as long as it is set in the Barbieland. Only that everyone here is Barbie or Ken sometimes makes it a bit difficult to follow the exact differences between all Barbies and Kens.<br><br>When the story moves to the real world, it changes the movie a bit. For example, how exactly it is possible to travel between the two worlds is not really clearly explained. Furthermore, the movie loses credibility when Barbie and Ken can do anything in the real world with no real consequences. Due to the lack of explanation and an eye for detail, the film can sometimes come across as a bit strange.<br><br>In a comical way, they also try to make fun of both gender roles. For example, Barbieland should represent the opposite of the real world. In Barbieland, Barbies and Kens can do anything, but Barbie is often above Ken. In the real world, men often seem to be above women. For example, they try to divide this role in the opposite way. For male viewers, who do not like these current feminism movements, this can make this film less.<br><br>Despite multiple actors and actresses playing different Barbies and Kens, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling manage to portray their roles in more unique ways alongside the other Barbies and Kens cast members. Margot Robbie comes across as a real Barbie, trying to discover what her life destinies really are. Ryan Gosling manages to provide plenty of appropriate comedic moments as Ken, who tries to make Barbie notice him. In the real world, however, he learns that as Ken, he can also do other things without Barbie. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the toy company that makes the barbie doll. His character and the other employees are supposed to be in the real world, but they seem more like they're also in a cartoon world because of the ways they act. This makes the concept of the real world seem a bit unusual. If they brought out the real world a little better, the movie could have been a little better.<br><br>The Barbie and Ken concept is better brought to the fore in Toy Story 3, for example, where these dolls and the idea they stand for are also handled a bit playfully.",5
" It's really something different and that's a good thing
","It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.",9

This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.<br><br>Good humour but when they don't have anything to say they sing songs. Basically a musical movie, reminds me of High School Musical.<br><br>Margot Robbie is amzing but Ryan Gosling steals the show not with his looks but his acting.

" This is a work of art.
","This is a masterpiece with little to no short-cuts taken on everything that makes a film great - writing, wardrobe, make-up, choreography, set, acting etc. The cast is incredible. Margot Robbie fits the role of Barbie so well. Ryan Gosling (IMO) steals the show as Ken. I found his performance to be the stand-out. I always love seeing Issa Rae anywhere and I think she should be everywhere because she's so talented. I can't say enough about America Ferrera's monologue rant - the writing of that monologue was spectacular but Ferrera's delivery of it was one of my favourite scenes in this movie.<br><br>I think Greta Gerwig's work here is incredible and I think this movie will be remembered for many years to come.",10

The universe and characters are very well developed, thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts. The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated. There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline. My only complaint was how much focus there was on the ""Ken's."" He was a worthwhile villain, but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone; however, everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head.<br><br>Overall, this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",7

" Heart-warming, serious and such an important movie for everyone to see!
","When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.",10
" Only for Margot Robbie.....
","This movie is specially for those who loves the character of barbie specially in childhood. This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....",6
" Hardly any laughter in my theater, though perhaps the film wasn't meant to entertain
","In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.<br><br>Off-screen, apparently Ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and Barbie had some realizations about how she treated Ken, but we don't get to see any of this nuance actually played out. Hugely missed opportunities there.<br><br>Bottom line: As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were, I wish this movie just didn't exist. Keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director.",3
" Love it 😍
","The beauty in the movie isn't merely skin deep. The story woven throughout Barbie is a true testament to the power of belief in oneself and the importance of friendship and teamwork. Barbie's determination and courage in the face of challenges inspire viewers to embrace their own strengths and strive for greatness. The characters in Barbie are wonderfully developed, each with their own unique personalities that add depth and charm to the narrative. Barbie herself, with her resilience and strong sense of justice, is a shining example of a positive role model.<br><br>Her friends are equally engaging, showcasing the power of unity and support.<br><br>Beyond the captivating story, Barbie also crafts an empowering message about inner beauty and acceptance.

" Too much social commentary not enough Barbie
","I knew this was going to be political going in but I thought its Barbie so I could overlook it. But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it's left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very ""told and not shown"" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn't really like that. The ending was confusing does Barbie want to have a baby?",6
" She's everything! He's just Ken.
","Fantastic movie! The writing and storyline is so much deeper than I could have imagined for a Barbie movie. I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice opening week and plan to buy it once it hits streaming. I think women and girls of all ages will love it. I know plenty of guys who like it as well. It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal. I loved her version of Little Women and this is every bit as good. Barbie is a must see. Don't wait, go see it now!",10

She thinks about death,her feet are flat and she shows emotions. So she decides to go to weird Barbie (Kate McKennon) for advice and travels to the real world to find her owner Gloria(Ferrara) and her daughter Sasha to find out why she is malfunctioning. But will Barbie choose the real world or the plastic land of Barbie Land?.<br><br>Overall I actually liked this film .Yes it's very silly and stupid but it was entertaining. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken who is obsessed with horses and prospecy and the other guys as Ken including new Dr Who Ncuti and Secret Invasion star Kingston Ben Adir and Michael Cena as Allan. I guess if I had to change anything it would be for Barbie to stay in the human world more and actually have them as actual Barbie dolls first like Life Size or even Enchanted animated.<br><br>If you loved Elf(since Will Ferrell stars in both films and the setting mirrors it too) and The Lego Movie along with adding sexual innuendo and woman's rights along with men's rights then you'll enjoy it. Would I recommend 6 year olds to see it no,unless they have a parent.<br><br>6/10.",6
" Barbie existentialism.
","Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. ""Barbie"" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.",10
" A mix of somewhat funny summer-movie and social commentary. But it's all over the place.
","A commercial stretched into a full-length feature film.<br><br>Barbieland, as an inversion of the real world with which it s mentally connected had a lot of potential. However, Barbie (both the doll and the film) is primarily a corporate product, and it's evident that the creators were not given freedom to explore the material in a more sophisticated way.<br><br>The film explores several social issues (feminism, patriarchy, sexism, ...) in a way that may seem too preachy, in-your-face or even off-putting. I'd say that these topics are intentionally depicted with a child-like mindset and it may take a while to wrap our adult heads around such approach.<br><br>Despite this, thanks to the vibrant cinematography, over-the-top social commentary, skillful direction, and great performances (Gosling as Ken rules), Barbie manages to entertain, albeit in a somewhat absurd way.<br><br>Nevertheless, I expected more from it.",7
" Disappointing and misleading
","The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could've been great.<br><br>For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.<br><br>For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It's a ""lecturing feminist"" and ""bring down the patriarchy"" kind of movie. I wasn't expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.<br><br>In general, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.",5

","Good movie not a great one.<br><br>My hopes for this movie were not all that high and the little light of hope for me was the fact that Greta Gerwig would be in the directors chair but as I had suspected she was not given 100% control of the film. I guarantee that every single second of this film was signed off by Mattel and you can definitely tell in some spots where they were the final say.<br><br>Overall the story is ok, the setup is absolutely horrendous but after that the story becomes better and more interesting. The theme of feminism is very obviously woven throughout and does a decent job of bringing some of the issues the women face to life.<br><br>The greatest achievement is the production and costume design as Barbieland is a very immersive experience but where it falls short are the scenes in the real world which just don't compare.<br><br>The acting was all around good and had a couple of standouts including Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera. The big surprise was honestly Margot Robbie's performance which was far from the best in the film. Not to say Margot was bad just surprising considering she is the lead.<br><br>Overall Barbie is good and will definitely get some nods for production and costume design during award season. Greta Gerwig was already a rising star in Hollywood but after taking on a film of this magnitude her phone will be ringing off the hook.",6
" Only thing that saved this was good acting and sound track
","Honestly, not too sure what my partner and I were expecting, but we figured it would be a fun, empowering, and sweet movie.<br><br>Instead, we got a preachy, confused, mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way.<br><br>Unfortunately, I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience. The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.<br><br>Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there.",5
" I didn't think it would be good.
","But damnit, it was GREAT. The opening scene was good, then the first scene in Barbieland worried me. Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for. The link was weird but vibrant and balanced in a way the big screen really lit up.<br><br>Also, no spoilers, but the Ken bonfires scene made me actually laugh out loud. And I love comedy, but almost never laugh out loud.",10
" Not Kenough
","Barbie is a thoughtful homage to an iconic toy brand that overturns the well known stereotype of the blonde, plastic ""bimbo"". It is also undeniably Mattel's punt at keeping Barbie relevant and commercially viable for the next generation.<br><br>In one fell swoop a corporate, patriarchal brand tries to distance its own corporate image from Barbie ""herself"" whilst also politically sanitising their toy brand at the same time. It's a PR stunt through and through. They want Barbie to be about individuality and self-determination, and that's all well and good; but there's still a corporate brand behind the curtain, even despite the gags (Will Ferrell) alluding to that ironic hypocrisy, such as the groveling admission about ""one or two"" previous Mattel CEOs being women, amongst a long line of men.<br><br>That aside, on its own merits as a film this was very preachy and very convoluted throughout, the crossover between the two ""worlds"" was a really cool idea that just needed more development and streamlining to land properly. Barbie was well cast (Margot Robbie), as was her playboy, Ken (Ryan Gosling) and the comic relief alter-Ken, Alan (Michael Cera). Many of the ingredients and characters for a good film were present, but the execution fell flat.<br><br>Somewhere beneath the political hullabaloo the film contains a valid message about mutual respect between the genders and a lesson on self actualisation. But ultimately, the film forgot that Barbie and Ken could have had some *fun* whilst also making the points the film set out to make. Making many of the characters superficial Kens or Barbies made the palette a boring and grating one, even despite the points that were trying to be made about individuality. The film also often lacked the light touch needed to captivate young girls who actually play with Barbie dolls and who won't necessarily understand the high level commentary at play here. Even if a mum or elder sister explains it to them afterwards.",6

","Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)<br><br>*The list of gorlz is ever growing and may only be influenced by my opinion.",10

Which is odd since it's about the most iconic doll of all time.<br><br>The creation of the Barbie world was awesome: sets and props. But the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didn't impress, and neither did the resolution of the story. How about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other? Some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble. Also, they didn't have to pointedly throw in that Barbie was drinking cow milk- cow on the label in all caps. Are the writers anti vegan? At least they mentioned in the film to the audience that Ken was wearing faux fur, but it was like a condescending little note because I guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows. Anyways, the best parts of this movie were: Ryan Gosling all the way (gorgeous, funny, singing and dancing,) the conflict between the two alpha Kens and introducing me to Simu Liu and Issa Rae. Despite its flaws, I'm glad I followed the hype and saw this movie. But I doubt I could sit through it again, it's just too silly and canned preachy.",6

Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"", ""Little Women"") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.<br><br>In Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling). One night at a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. The next day, Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. After following advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard.<br><br>If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, I'm sure nearly everyone's first pick would be none other than Mattel's Barbie. Since first being launched back in 1959, Barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even President of the United States. There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles, all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. Now adding to that catalogue, Greta Gerwig's live action cinematic feature titled simply ""Barbie"" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.<br><br>What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world's view of the societal hierarchy since 2014's ""The LEGO Movie"". When we first see Barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. That is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the ""Kens"" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other ""Barbies"". It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion Stereotypical Ken's desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world. Upon arriving, Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. In any normal instance, I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. In Barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.<br><br>In addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. There were a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbieland's populace live their lives. For instance, the Barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. Also, the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other Barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. However, some of the film's most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. There's even the occasional jab taken at Mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories. While not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. In fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie I've ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.<br><br>I also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal CG giving Barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. As one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. Nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. Believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. It's rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.<br><br>As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world, Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. The fact that there's nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. Robbie's Barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her. Though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world. What I liked best about Robbie's performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.<br><br>Whether intentional or not, I think Ryan Gosling's version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing Gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of Barbie's boyfriend was quite a surprise. Although this isn't the first comedic role Gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie, only to realise he cannot ""swim"" in the placemat water. Later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. There's just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.<br><br>From the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film ""Barbie"" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. It offers an observant satire about the world's views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don't care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. In that regard, this film has done its job.<br><br>I rate it a solid 9/10.",9
" Barbie is fun, but gets too focused on the social commentary and does not do the plot justice.
","Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.",7
" Good acting, good budget. Thats all that was good.
","I think i laughed maybe twice. Michael cera was probably the best thing in the movie and he wasnt that funny here. Nothing made sense, there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream, just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch. I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of ""manly"". Overall it was just super weird and not that funny.",3
" Laughed tears and that's Kenough
","I saw the trailer and knew it would be a pretty fun movie to watch. It was so over the top with just everything (colours, world of women, world of men, horses and lectures) that in the end, all what matters was I laughed tears watching it. And so did everybody in the cinema I went to. The beach fight, Ken's obsession with horses and Will Ferrell on rollerblades.. it can't get better than that. The only issue for me was the end, when Barbie decides to go to the real world. That scene was a bit long.<br><br>If you like sarcasm, satire and Will Ferrell, go and watch! You will have a colourfull two hours.",10
" Weird, Funny And Thought Provoking
","I saw Barbie, starring Margot Robbie-Babylon, the Suicide Squad movies; Ryan Gosling-Blade Runner 2049, La La Land; America Ferrera-Superstore_tv, Ugly Betty_tv; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Ghostbusters_2016 and Will Ferrell-Holmes &amp; Watson, the Daddy's Home movies.<br><br>This is a weird, funny and thought provoking movie about a doll that was created in 1959 by Ruth Handler. Before the movie starts, there are several music videos with singers and stars from the film. The movie then goes straight to Barbie Land, where everything is pink-Barbie's favorite color-and everyone sings and dances a lot. Margot is the main Barbie-there are lots of them, of course, as well as Kens-and Ryan is the main Ken. Everything is going along like usual for Margo until she starts having visions of death and despair. The rest of the Barbies tell her to consult with Kate-the weird Barbie-and Kate tells her that she must go to the real world and find out the source of her problems. Ryan goes with her and they both discover that in the real world, it's not run by Barbies but instead by men. Will plays the CEO of Mattel and America is his secretary. There are messages about feminism and the role of the Barbie doll in shaping little girls' minds-both good and bad-and there are several cameos of actors you may recognize, as Ken and Barbie.<br><br>It's rated PG-13 for some language and some sexual innuendo-mostly just jokes-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 54 minutes.<br><br>Although I would probably not buy it on DVD, it is entertaining and would be a good one to stream.",7
" Funny but toxic feminist tale that doesn't make sense
","The movie has a very clever intro, a charming set-up filled with sight gags, and some hilarious lines (especially those spoken by the narrator - Helen Mirren).<br><br>However, it's essentially about a town of marginalized and emasculated men (the Kens) and when they discover they are only disaffected props, they create a toxic patriarchy (although we never see how they do it). The Barbies then manipulate the Kens, using feminine wiles and playing dumb, to coerce the Kens into a war with each other to distract them back into submission.<br><br>Adding to a magnum of plot holes, and an ending that takes WAY too long, is a weird 'Pinocchio' twist when Barbie only becomes satisfied with her existence when she gets a vagina.<br><br>This film panders to a pseudo-feminist audience. If you want to see a film where feminism is funny and wins in the end, see Legally Blonde.",4
" Beautiful and Spectacular
",Amazing to watch and delved into womanhood using incredible references. Weird Barbie was such a humorous touch but every part of humour managed to add to the true meaning of the film. Even weird barbie highlighted how barbie was exploited by some users for their enjoyment using her ridiculing and yet she's seen as ugly despite the true fun and amusement she's brought to the world. Amazing soundtrack aswell though I felt some songs couldn't be heard very well at all. Amazing performance from Margot Robbie but as Helen Mirren said she was the wrong person to cast for sympathy during that scene where she calls herself ugly!,10
" An enjoyable fun filled fantasy
","Director Greta Gerwig takes us on a fun ride in the life of stereotypical Barbie ( Margot Robbie) as she navigates through various aspects of her life. She is joined by Ken ( Ryan Gosling) in this fantasy of pink decor, colourful costumes and the kitsch sets in a dream like atmosphere . The movie has exquisite cinematography ,melodious songs and attractive dances. There is an innocent quirkiness in the characters and the intermittent light humour keeps one amused. There is fun and fantasy all the way in all colourful scenes. The rainbows in the background add to the beauty. The cinematography has carefully framed fabulous visuals which will appeal to all audiences. The highlight of course is the superb acting of Margot Robbie who excells in exuding the innocent charm of the much loved character. She is definitely a refined artist who gets under the skin of the character. Ryan Gosling also does well as Ken showing his versatility. His one liners are said with his typical charm which will please his fans. The special effects help to create the dream like ambience and are pleasing to watch. I forsee the movie getting nominated for best actress ( Margot Robbie ) and for production design, costume design , make up and cinematography.",7
" Barbie is a masterpiece and I'm not joking
","I'm not a Barbie fan. The only time I loved Barbie was when she was in the Toy Story movies. But that changed after I saw the Barbie movie. This movie is not only Greta Gerwig's best film but also the year's greatest movie so far!!!!! Margot Robbie (my favorite actress of all time) is beautiful and portrays Barbie with pure perfection!!! And then there's Ken (played by Ryan Gosling in a career-best performance)!!! Robbie and Gosling shine and are easily the years best duo.<br><br>The story starts with Barbie doing her usual routine in Barbieland, a land filled with multiple Barbies, each with a different occupation. The Ken's also visit playing the roles a woman would play. Barbie starts experiencing real emotional symptoms like thinking about death, crying and flat feet. She learns from Weird Barbie that the Real World will have the answers to her questions. Barbie than travels with Ken to the real world and find out many things : Barbie is a doll played by a grown woman named Gloria (America Ferrera in her best movie performance), Mattel wants to put Barbie back in the box and Ken learns about America's patriarchy and men rule the world. All of these problems combine into a hilarious comedy that provides great messages about woman empowerment and being who you want to be.<br><br>The production design of Barbieland and costumes of all the Barbies and Kens are Oscar-worthy. The soundtrack is pretty solid with two great songs: Ryan Gosling's 80s ballad called I'm Just Ken and Billie Ellish's emotional song at the end of the movie, ""What was I made for?"".<br><br>The direction of Greta Gerwig is finally put to great use in Barbie as she's goes to make the best comedy in years and the script she wrote with her partner Noah Baumbach is the perfect mixture of stupid comedy, great-comedy drama and emotional drama.<br><br>Gosling gives his best and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination as his role of Ken is up there with the comedy greats of Meliss Mccarthy in Bridesmaids and Robert Downey Jr. In Tropic Thunder.<br><br>The real scene stealer is Margot Robbie. Robbie has been in multiple box office failures but Barbie changed that. She's been nominated twice for the Oscar for her incredible performances in I, Tonya and Bombshell. My favorite actress is about to be nominated for Best Actress and Best Picture for Barbie!!!! Margot Robbie is astonishing and a tour de force in Barbie, which is the best performance of her whole career!!! Go Margot Robbie!!!!!<br><br>This movie is definitely worth watching!!!!!! I want to watch it again!!!!!!",10
" Funny And Good Cast, But Not This ""Great"" Movie Everyone's Been Saying
","I wasn't dying to see this, but I felt like I had to participate in the Barbenheimer phenomenon, and the trailer looked good, so I went. I went in with reasonably high expectations because the reviews were high and it has a good cast and crew behind it. I was slightly disappointed.<br><br>I enjoy Robbie's acting, and I also like Will Ferrell (who doesn't), it's got some good chuckles, the screenplay is solid. The soundtrack is also pretty good.<br><br>Now, what's bad about it? Well, I felt like a film like this would be a tad more realistic then it was. This felt like an animated film inside a live action film. I feel like there were some parts that were unnecessary.<br><br>Well, it was pretty good. If you want a comedy, you'd like this one.<br><br>NOTE: Although I enjoyed both, I think Oppenheimer reigns superior to Barbie.",7
" Billion Dollar Barbie.
","I doubt this film will be remembered in 80 years. Its no Wizard of Oz. However, it caught the zeitgeist in the summer of 2023. And made its truly talented female director hugely bankable.<br><br>Barbie (the beautiful Robbie) goes into the real world accompanied by Ken (an almost as beautiful Gosling) her ultimate fashion accessory, when she suffers from strange un Barbie like symptoms. Thoughts of death, flat feet etc. From there views on feminity and masculinity are explored and the everlasting tug of war and power shifts between men and women.<br><br>Beautifully photographed with magnificent sets. Both will be nominated for Oscars. The leads are top notch, Robbie makes a stunning Barbie and Gosling a hilarious Ken.<br><br>What Barbie has done has got people back into the cinemas and revitalised the film industry. For that alone it deserves 10. Well done.",10
" A very enjoyable film
","Barbie is the latest toy being turned into a live action movie and stars Margot Robbie(Suicide Squad), Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Michael Cena(Scott Pilgram Vs The World),Alexandra Shipp(A Dogs Way Home),America Ferrara (Ugly Betty)and Will Ferrell(Elf). Directed by Greta Gerwig the film follows Barbie(Robbie) a sophisticated young doll who notices that she is slowly turning human so she goes to the real world to find her previous owner and to meet the CEO boss (Ferrell) to find out why she is malfunctioning.<br><br>Will she go back to BarbieLand or stay in the real world. Overall I was very surprised by this film. The cinematography was very good if not artificial,the story reminded me of Elf meets The Lego Movie. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken. Also stars Rhea Pherlman from Matilda,Helen Mirren as the narrator who throws fourth wall jokes,singer Dua Lipa as a mermaid and John Cena as a merman. Its a very silly yet stupid film but it's definetly a good movie.",6
" Overrated
","This movie is a cinematic catastrophe that leaves viewers questioning the very fabric of reality. This film takes a seemingly interesting concept and turns it into an excruciatingly tiresome and overhyped ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.<br><br>First and foremost, the titular character, barbie, is an annoying and grating presence from the moment she graces the screen. Her incessant whining, exaggerated emotions, and dramatic outbursts quickly wear out their welcome. It's like watching a never-ending loop of a soap opera with no redeeming qualities. Barbie's character is not only unrelatable but also unbearable, making it impossible to invest any emotional connection with her.<br><br>The premise of a doll coming to life and entering the real world could have been intriguing, but it's executed with such carelessness and lack of creativity that it falls flat. Instead of exploring the endless possibilities of this concept, the movie opts for mind-numbing clichés and uninspired gags. It's as if the writers couldn't be bothered to put any effort into crafting a compelling narrative.<br><br>The film's overhyped marketing and anticipation only serve to underscore its crushing disappointment. It's as if the marketing team desperately tried to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and the result is a movie that leaves you wondering if you could have spent those precious hours doing something more worthwhile, this movie is a regrettable waste of time and money. Its annoying and one-dimensional protagonist, coupled with a lackluster plot and sluggish pacing, make it a forgettable cinematic experience. I strongly advise against watching this film and suggest looking elsewhere for more fulfilling and entertaining movie options.",1
" Watch this!
","""I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll...""<br><br>Bro I was so excited just to look at the beautiful painted sets and watch the beautiful Barbies and Kens wear goofy clothes...but this was a deep movie.<br><br>The seemingly perfect matriarchal world of Barbie has has a sudden setback when the perfectly Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie)'s heels land flatly on the ground.<br><br>Barbie has to leave Barbieland through a surreal theatrical series of vehicles to wind up in California, where she meets her creators at Mattel and others.<br><br>Of course Mattel, one of the producers, wanted to paint themselves in a positive light. They probably over-emphasize their importance in the playroom (They assert Barbie was the first doll to not be a baby doll, the first opportunity little girls had to play at being something other than a mother, which I find hard to believe). But there is definitely some honest criticism in the movie of who Barbie is and what she represents. Does Barbie make women feel bad about their bodies? Maybe.<br><br>There are also a couple very playful moments where it feels almost like it feels when one plays with toys. Made me think of the Lego Movie (Which also had Will Ferrell in it).<br><br>Then there's the characters. There is humor. There is music. There are of, course, gorgeous people and sets. But most of all, there is self-actualization and growth.<br><br>I love every line in this film. I keep thinking about it. I've seen the movie twice now and I hope to see it again. Please watch it. Prepare to cry.",10
" Loved The Barbie Doll As A kid, Loved The Barbie Movie As An Adult
","Barbie (2023) :
Movie Review -<br><br>Barbie Review: Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly Ride Into Barbieland. These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. Being a boy, I couldn't have a Barbie doll in my childhood, but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. And I don't think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. It's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl, I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.<br><br>Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. Soon, we are transported into Barbie Land, where all Barbies are living happily. All the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. Our stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. Obviously, Ken (Gosling) forces his company on her. However, things go wrong for Barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy. Ken returns and takes over Barbieland by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. Here, distraught Barbie finds Gloria (America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with her daughter Sasha's (Ariana Greenblatt) Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie. Gloria restores Barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Barbies.<br><br>It's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell. I mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. It may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. The humour is girlish, yes, but I liked it too. From Zack Snyder, The Godfather, cautionary note on Margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, Barbie is such a colourful comedy. It does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. That's one of the points I'd say went wrong in the climax. These characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. Why? Pixar's Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. It may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. Now, whether it's good or bad, I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.<br><br>Barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for Margot Robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as Barbie. I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and I couldn't find it for 110 minutes. I melted, man. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. That cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. Kate McKinnon's weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. Other babies, including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackay, Dua Lipa, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Ritu Arya, and Nicola Coughlan, are all gorgeous. On the other hand, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu, Rob Brydon, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena as Kens add fine support. Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, and Will Ferrell pass the time well, while Rhea Perlman's cameo is blasting. The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America Ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. Ariana Greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.<br><br>Made on a budget of $145 million, Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. Those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. Who's to blame? Rodrigo Prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken. Barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of Nick Houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. Some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without Greta Gerwig. This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. A few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's Chuck that discussion. Let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. Not to forget, who's writing it.<br><br>RATING - 6/10*",6
" Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
","This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.<br><br>Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. Misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.<br><br>I didn't expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie, but I also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. I would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. Is this movie harmful? Yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.<br><br>Many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows... I don't know what this says, but the optics don't look well. The fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and I hope every viewer realises that.",5
" Greta shows real power of woman in Barbie
","Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.",10
" Half good half bad
","I saw this movie right now and mostly enjoyed it. The good parts are really enjoyable, but sometimes I was just bored. I really don't know how they did it, but near the end of the movie some scenes were the peak of cinema and some were just uninteresting.<br><br>They aren't subtle with the politics, the political stuff is very preachy, but my biggest complain about the political stuff is that the movie is not entertaining when they bring it up.<br><br>I expected a funny quirky movie, but I got to learn about political stuff, which wasn't that good. However, the movie is good when they don't talk about it.",6
" We are all Barbie
","Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.",10
" Just enjoy it. It's funny.
","First off, I'm a 60 year-old white male and this movie wasn't even made for me.<br><br>If your at all interested, then go see this movie. It's funny. It has a lot of funny lines and scenes.<br><br>The recreation of the set is incredible, but maybe a little vidual indigestion. You adapt quickly.<br><br>The characters are really good. Perfect for what they are expected to be. Both the main Barbie and Ken are excellently portrayed.<br><br>There is a feminist overtone, but there is no lack of irony and mockery of both sexes. No one is asking you to be moved or to change your political or other persuasion. Just relax and enjoy it as a comedy.<br><br>The people who criticize this movie for political or macho reasons are way out of bounds and are too easily swayed by today's political environment. This move is a funny comedy that might actually open your eyes to a feminist point of view of you choose to absorb it. If not, you'll still laugh and call it a good time.",7
" Am totally speechless by what just happened here
","No way on earth this was possible but that's the thing it was possible that the actual barbie movie was so inspiring that I just had to make it the movie of my month despite all odds there's like no way I'm hell that it would surprise any one all the hype worth it all the praise worth it and behold all the stars worth it everything barbie is just golden sorry platinum just to be precised in my opinion, it's like am the only one who feels this way but thinking about how awesome all the connections sums up it's just so magical from the story to the history infact just see this movie. Am a feminist so that's all thee more reason.",10
" A Stellar First Two Acts Followed by a Relatively Disappointing Third
","Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.<br><br>Without spoiling plot, Barbie much like Game of Thrones and Hunger Games hints at complex understanding of social and political issues but ultimately settles on the safest most vanilla possible answers to those problems. It also, in modern fashion, wastes time going off on tangents.<br><br>I feel, much like Margot Robbie, pulled in two directions. A part of me wants to praise the film for shedding on light on feminist issues while another wishes to tear it to shreds for copping out in the end.<br><br>The further one gets into Barbie, the less its complexities feel like they are there to make a point, and the more it feels they are there to fill time.<br><br>If you're like me you'll leave in a disappointed but forgiving mood. Even if the ending fumbles what was set up, I can't forget my enjoyment of the setting up itself.",7
" Great for the ladies, but Kens stay away
","Oppression is a state of mind, even when objectively you are oppressed.<br><br>The biggest problem with this movie is that it leans HARD into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by MEN (as if we're some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugated-talk about intellectually lazy) AND the only acceptable man is an Allen (wimpy effeminate man). This movie could've provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes, or how men and women complement each other, but NO. Instead in the final act, it chooses sides. And the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side, the ""equity"" side. The side of ""well, do unto others as you FEEL (in your hyper-oppressed feeling state) they've done unto you."" You feel like the Kens have done you wrong, so you oppress them in return. Never mind the Barbies oppressed the Kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie, and the entirety of the first act. But no, the Kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay. Equity demands retribution, so all men, excuse me, Kens, must pay.<br><br>While I laughed and enjoyed the first two acts, in the end I felt thoroughly disappointed, angry, nauseated. If they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it would've been a 10/10, but they couldn't resist making it propaganda. I guess the joke's on me for taking our girls to it.<br><br>Also, there's a monologue in the third act which could've been BRILLIANT, if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how ALL HUMANS feel (not just women, men too). Every man I've ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society, from women, from other men. It's not just a woman thing.<br><br>Oh and then the last 5-10 minutes or so were... almost like a different movie. It just didn't line up with who Barbie was, and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occur.<br><br>In the end, THIS KEN (me) cannot recommend this film to other Kens. Unless you're the kind of liberal / progressive man who believes the whole ""women are oppressed"" narrative. Then you'll probably love it. Every other guy though? Or the women who love them? I'd recommend taking a pass on this one. Or watch the first 75% and then leave.<br><br>Bottom line this is every bit as ""toxic"" as some forms of masculinity. This is just ""toxic feminism."" And I say that as a feminist.",4
" Perceptive Take on the Barbie Mythos
","There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.",8
" Pink Political Power is: Fun, Funny At Times, Deep, But Aggressively Weird
","LIKES:<br><br>The Setting:
-It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.<br><br>-Plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.<br><br>-The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it's really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of Mattel bringing it to life.<br><br>The Plot's Originality:
-Yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye
-Barbie's plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasn't expecting.<br><br>-It may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.<br><br>The Acting:
-McKinnon may have been used too much, but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie. Quirky, fun, a little bold, but that SNL line delivery that really works for delivering lines.<br><br>-Rae is fine for when she is on screen. She's got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn't make sense to me
-Ryan Gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. He's clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.<br><br>-And for Margot Robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. She's sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. Gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for.<br><br>The Comedy At Times:
-The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.<br><br>-Satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. The design of Barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. It was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.<br><br>-Some of the Ken lines were funny, the fact that I was like classic Patrick from SpongeBob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.<br><br>-And Helen Mirren's narration was the funniest component for me. Her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.<br><br>-As such, the comedy did work at times for me.<br><br>The Pace:
-It's two hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.<br><br>-Barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.<br><br>-Then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.<br><br>-That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.<br><br>The Music:
-By far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.<br><br>-The songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.<br><br>-Other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.<br><br>-As for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. Remixes of Barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be.<br><br>The Message:
-There is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... I did enjoy this part of Gerwig's writing.<br><br>-It's deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. I liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.<br><br>DISLIKES:<br><br>The Fun Vibes Take a Detour:
-I just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.<br><br>-Gerwig is a very ""unique"" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film's fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.<br><br>-I t felt a bit forced for me, and I longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.<br><br>-Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie.<br><br>Gerwig's Hyper Agenda
-I get this is who she is, but I've seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.<br><br>-But Barbie... Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of.<br><br>-There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.<br><br>-If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.<br><br>The Stupidity:
-The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn't accomplish much for me.<br><br>-Will Ferrell's direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.<br><br>-Meanwhile, Ken's handling was fine being a moron, but Gerwig's political writing sort of didn't do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.<br><br>-That excessiveness again just doesn't work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie.<br><br>The Character Usage is odd:
-The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.<br><br>-Barbie has too many characters, and some of the people I expected to have more time, were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.<br><br>-They do their work, but, it's just missing balance and full use and I think it's relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.<br><br>The Story Is All Over The Place:
-My fellow reviewers are right, it's a weird story and it is all over the place.<br><br>-This might give it the unique twist, but Barbie's tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.<br><br>-One level is like I said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.<br><br>-The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going
-Third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way I'm still trying to process.<br><br>-Gerwig's writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.<br><br>The VERDICT:
Barbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in. A geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. I loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. And the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. But the movie did not appeal to me in that Gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and ""elevated"" leading to moments that just don't appeal to a reviewer like me. The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off Gerwig's better writing. Thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it's a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. The score is:<br><br>Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",7
" It's Cute, But Definitely Overhyped
","Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie. Of course she's incredibly beautiful, talented, funny, and hip; however, I didn't have some life-altering epiphany, like so many others did. I actually thought the film was way too cheesy, 45 minutes too long, and also confusing at times. I love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint, the idea of Ken learning about misogyny and sexism, essentially bringing these twisted ideas to Barbieland, leading all Barbies to succumb to a more subservient role, while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power, talents, intelligence, and individuality. But after an hour or so, I kept thinking, ""Why can't Barbie just sing a song?!"" I wanted a fluffier, comedic Barbie, while what I got was a doll having an existential crisis. It was depressing at times. The cast was phenomenal, of course. I just didn't expect it to be such a mess in terms of storytelling.",4
" A lot of fun and surprisingly funny
","The movie is surprisingly well written. Yes it is a fluff piece, it's called Barbie after all, but for what it was a lot of thought went into all the little details.<br><br>Fun both in barbieland and the real world, the jokes were surprising as quite a few of them were at Mattel's expense.<br><br>It tackles real world issues but in a fun and light hearted way. It is however 100% targeted at women, I'd say middle aged since that was the majority of the theater and the topics not really suitable for young girls.<br><br>I do wonder if it was a bit harsh on men as it did lean way too much into He vs She debate in the second half.<br><br>Margot Robbie was amazing as Barbie but Ryan Gosling very much stole the show. He owned every second of his screen time.",8
" Ryan Gosling, a pure showman
","If forgotten, Ryan Gosling started off in the mickey mouse club. Important to remember because wow what a talented individual. Recent memory sees him leading roles that require a more stoic subdued approach, and it can be easy to miss his range. Barbie seeks to utilize all his acting muscles, and to a resounding success. He can sing, dance, act, and do comedy.<br><br>It wouldn't be totally outrageous to suggest he is the star of the movie. Of course, he is one of the stars, but I would posit he is THE star of Barbie's movie.<br><br>I was left wondering if the Ken story arc was the stronger theme of the film. Overall, I felt an absurdist philosophy underlined the film. There was a feminist message, sure, but it wasn't as nuanced as Ken's perspective on the patriarchy. At one point, Gosling's Ken quips ""When I found out patriarchy wasn't about horses, I lost interest.""<br><br>Ken's attitude speaks to the idea that most likely the majority of men could care less about a patriarchy or how the world works. They're on the ride like everyone else and playing a role in the fantasy of getting a gal to look there way. In essence, the reality is Ken is only Ken in relation to Barbie being Barbie and the truth is everyone is an Allan.",6
" Barbie has an existential crisis
","Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while it's colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.<br><br>The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing, from the clothes, the wide variety of dolls, cars, pets, houses, and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what's being sold or what has been sold in the past. On another note, I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed, but that's what I liked about this movie, I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised. As the movie progresses you find yourself enjoying it more and more, it's well paced and it has a good story so I definitely recommend it!",8
" Fun soundtrack , story a bit confusing
","I loved the music , and the fun start.<br><br>A bit of cheeky humor , and dance choreography.<br><br>The story was quite confusing, it felt like being glued with superglue and not consistent from the beginning to the end . The ending was quite weird . And switching between the two worlds of the story did not make much sense . The character from the Mattel management did not add any value to the story . If they were edited out , I think no one would even notice a difference .<br><br>The main male character has done a good job , especially in his macho phase .<br><br>The female main character was lovely . Absolutely gorgeous and well played .",7
" I identify as both Barbie and Ken...
","I identify as both Barbie and Ken... This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and it even made me cry. This film is such a raw, yet humorous look at how hard life is, as well as gender and everything that falls under that... From how the patriarchy hurts both men and women, how hard it is to live and not be exceptional, and the ideas at play in life. I loved the costume and set design, it feels like everyone in this film really cared about the franchise of Barbie. I feel like all of imagination at play is gorgeous. The soundtrack is also an amazing piece here. I've seen this film twice, and it has truly affected my life... Incredible.",10
" I don't know how to describe
",The movie was weirdly quick at the beginning and weirdly long at the end. The beginning of the film felt like a glorified way to show off Margot Robbie's feet. The movie it self was quite meta at times and even made me laugh but I felt like it had too much hype. Also was the movie about sexism or getting older and was Will Ferril the villain or was Ken. There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different. I Manley started re-enjoying the movie was when the kens had their battle. Sorry if I have wasted your time but that's my opinion.,6
" Not for me.
","Barbie (Margot Robbie) travels from Barbieland to the real world where she learns to her surprise that men are in control...<br><br>I'm not a fan of this Barbie movie - regardless of whether I agree with its feminist message about the patriarchy or not, I just didn't find it funny and I didn't find it enjoyable. The humour was lame, I thought that the performances were weak (am I the only person who isn't a Margot Robbie fan?), and the songs were beyond awful.<br><br>About the only thing that I can commend about the film is its production design, but even that got on my nerves from time to time (the travelling to the real world from Barbieland on cardboard cut-outs -- sheesh!). Obviously, I'm in the minority for not liking this film, because it has a high rating and has made a mint at the box office, but I guess we can't all like the same things.",1
" Take your mom, sister, daughter, aunt, everyone to see this movie!
","This movie was so unexpected.<br><br>Completely opposite to what I thought it would be.<br><br>The best movie I've seen in a long time.<br><br>There were moments it had me laughing and moments in tears. It gently pushed me into self reflection and introspection which I never realised I needed to do for the longest of time.<br><br>The movie dealt with so many issues, such as societal expectancies, emotional depence, perfectionism, stress, anxiety.. It brought forward self awareness, emotional intelligence, and so many insights into ones self.<br><br>This movie is a must see for all women and men who are open to growth and developing their mindsets.<br><br>As a millenial this movie resonated on another level, it reminded me of the self I was at a younger age, before falling into societal norms.<br><br>Will definitely watch it again and again.",10
" Many Will Go, Most Will Enjoy
","Having just watched a woman drag her tween daughter out of the movie, trailed along a bit after by a couple of older sorts, I can tell you this movie is not what some people have envisioned.<br><br>It is not a light-hearted children's film. It is PG-13 for a reason and also if you haven't taught your daughter the word ""patriarchy"" yet, that might be something to cover first.<br><br>Second, it's not a paean to the Barbie doll, Barbie collectors, or Mattel as a corporation. Honestly, I'm not sure how they're signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab.<br><br>(The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters. No room to come back.)<br><br>So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie, not everyone will enjoy the show.<br><br>---<br><br>I personally thought it was ok--not as grand as expected, but I got to the end well enough.<br><br>The acting was the fun part, especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken--voice of male fragility.<br><br>Songs are catchy ear worms. The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll-like.<br><br>The plot is a weak point, I'll admit, being very simplistic.<br><br>Honestly, however, I kind of expected that. (So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)<br><br>Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is Allan's role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on, even now?<br><br>And since the ending sees Mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)<br><br>If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie, I'm not sure that marketing campaign did any favors. And if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed, the associated marketing merch kind of undercut the message, too.<br><br>At any rate, the directoral easter eggs kept me going through all of it (call back cinematic opening is just the start)
So there's good news and bad news, and maybe it's cost sunk fallacy making me give the film a seven. But I thought it was ""OK,"" so here we are.",7
" Days of Fun Movies are over

" OPP - Eve and Adam
","No pun intended - OPP as in other peoples .... patriarchy! What did you think the last p stood for? Naughty (by nature) are we? Kidding aside, I know that song too and I chose it ... well I would say wisely. Not sure if you think I am hammering anything home here ... I can tell you the movie is! And it did make quite a few people angry - now I understand that one should not count the times you hear the word patriarchy ... won't bode well for you. Also it is quite a lot.<br><br>But let's get back to the beginning. Why would a grown man even watch a Barbie movie? Well why not? Especially when it begins with one of the best homages to Kubricks 2001 (and Greta has learned quite a bit during her filmmaking career). That said, that completely insane beginning sets a tone - and there is a lot of weird stuff going off here (I think I would be good at beach offs - what do you mean it has nothing to do with the sea and the sand and the ... ohh ... I see)! But that is the point - actually there could have been way more weird stuff - I would have loved it.<br><br>That said, we do get great actors here - and they all have the same (character) name. Well almost - as easy as it is to remember their names (Ken and Barbie ... sorry Barbie and Ken obviously, lest we forget the star of the movie), is the message of the movie! But and that is what I liked about it more than the almost overbearing message: there is more to discover! You are not or rather you do not have to be what others expect you to be! You are not defined by your significant other (no matter your gender).<br><br>So while Ken may feel he is nothing without Barbie - well he may go off and do stuff he shouldn't be doing. Like ... (insert a joke about the main point the movie is making and then me explaining something you already know) ... but is it worth it getting hung up on that? Or is it rather better to just enjoy the movie and empower those who never had a voice? Yes a lot of cliches are being thrown around - and the fact many have declared war on ... the movie for no particular reason, makes this even sweeter! They are not even the target audience.<br><br>There are silly jokes (some aimed at a more grown up audience, like the beach off one), there are references to the doll itself - and there is a lot of comparison. Since this had the green light from Mattel itself it may have to include certain things that are here to shine a good light on them too. Still they don't mind being poked at too (entire board being male for example, a specific doll and much more).<br><br>Costume and set design is exactly what you would expect - I did not realize the massive budget this had (googled it because a friend mentioned it) .. but it made that money back boxoffice wise and then some.<br><br>Will Ferrell being the icing on the cake (even if he is unable to catch anything ... even when its right in front of him ... and taking the longest time to get to a beach ... well for obvious timing reasons and very considerate if you think of it) ... a cake that might be pink after all ... hey it once was a color men prefered ... so who knows, things may change one day ... right? (for the better of course)",9
" Funny and entertaining but kind of a mess
","The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.<br><br>The Barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls, and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience (even men) to think about. But if you are a male viewer, and if all you took from this movie is that ""it hates men"", then you completely missed the point. The movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques Barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be. It pokes fun at it, while never completely turning against Barbie as a product. This is a Barbie movie after all. That this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film, is a good thing, including criticizing gender stereotypes. But the execution leaves more to be desired.<br><br>There is plenty to critique about the Barbie movie that is valid. The Barbie movie tries to do a lot of things, and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess. The movie could have benefited from a bit more focus. Instead, it is all over the place.<br><br>Just the plot of Barbie and Ken being confronted with the real world, probably would have been enough for a whole movie. But to the movie's credit, it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a Barbie movie. I would argue, too much.<br><br>There's the plot of Mattel trying to capture Barbie, with the awkwardness of a Mattel product (what this movie is) critiquing Mattel. It never feels entirely earnest.<br><br>Then there's the plot of Barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her. This plot works the best, but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going on.<br><br>Then there's the side plot of Barbie meeting her creator, which at first feels like a random easter egg, but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie, without really fitting in with all the other plots. The Barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not. At first it seems as if Barbie-land is the place that is magical and unrealistic, which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor. Once Barbie and Ken visit the real world, the contrast leads to more humor. But then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world, and things become very messy. Such as Mattel having a mysterious floor where Barbie's deceased creator is still alive. This is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line, but that doesn't quite explain it either. The movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building. It was a side plot we didn't need in the first place.<br><br>Then there is the plot of Ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes, and then bringing all that back to Barbie-land. This plot feels a bit disjointed. It ends up dragging the third act back to Barbie-land, when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act. Everything with Barbie trying to make the other Barbies remember who they are, and revisiting ugly Barbie, should have been cut. It feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going on.<br><br>All in all, it is a bit of a mess storywise. This script could have used a bit more editing. Also, it ends on a joke about Barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist, which is a bit of low hanging fruit. When you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls, this is probably not the line should end on. Suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more sense.<br><br>As a comedy movie, you can't aim for a high bar story wise, when your movie's comedy is aiming for the lowest bar. It doesn't seem to work.",7
" A perfect dollhouse
","""Barbie"": Greta Gerwig's new film manages to be extremely creative and original while, at the same time, a bit generic. The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there's a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It's not; it's just more entertaining. The only ""weak"" storyline is that of the human mother-daughter duo and the executives. It's one of the weaker aspects of a good, fun, exciting, and creative film, which falls short of being even better due to stumbling over its details.",8
" Must admit I struggled!
","I guess my starting point was not a huge fan of anything Barbie, but to be honest I went in moderately openminded. The film was dull at times and at others quite subversive!<br><br>Some great humour some odd moments, felt a little stilted but that was clearly the intent of the film makers.<br><br>I sat through it feeling at the end mildly perplexed and unsure if I enjoyed it or not.<br><br>I felt it was at times quite clever but still a bit confusing much of the time.<br><br>As a 67 year old I may not be the best judge nor did the chatting 7-8 year old two seats away from me add much to the experience.<br><br>Go see and make your mind up, overall I much preferred Oppenheimer.",7
" Unexpectedly good!
","I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.",8
" It was pretty good but not worthy of the hype
","Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film. The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.<br><br>Ryan Gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in. Several of the cameos were also great.<br><br>Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'. Mostly watched it as the first part of the Barbenheimer meme, so it was worth it for that reason at least.<br><br>7/10.",7
" A funny film but with a spoon fed, preachy message and no real writing behind it
","Barbie was a very funny and cute movie, however, the movie had more fluff than substance. The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing ""lego movie"" and ""barbie goes to the real world"" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera's character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn't come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive. Also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like I was watching a super bowl half time commercial.",5
" Intelligent and charming
","This movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting. The script is quite clever and fun, and get this: there is not one word of profanity. (This just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be well-written and need not have dozens of f-bombs.) I give it even more bonus points for good actors who don't mumble. I was beginning to think that today's actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box. How refreshing to hear every word! Though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment, this is not a movie just for women. My husband enjoyed it very much. Young children won't get most of it, but they might enjoy the visuals. Highly recommended.",10
" Divided
","I saw this movie a month ago and I've had a hard time gathering my thoughts for a review. I think that I need to give it another watch. That being said, my reaction from my first viewing is mixed.<br><br>On one side, there are so many positives about this film. The casting is spot-on, with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling perfectly fitting their characters. The visuals in Barbie World are vibrant and exciting. The humor is excellent and made me genuinely laugh out loud. Not to mention the brilliance of Allan.<br><br>On the other side, the film has an agenda and they push it hard. The message of female empowerment is strong, but at times it crossed over into preachy territory. My theater hardly laughed and the entire row in front of me walked out about 3/4 through. While I loved the moments in Barbie World, I did not enjoy the scenes in the real world or anything with Will Ferrell.<br><br>At its core, this movie is a powerful reminder of what life is like for a woman (i.e., America Ferrera's monologue) and a call to action for me. Unfortunately, the in-your-face approach might alienate some rather than inspire.<br><br>Best Character: Ken (Though Allan was brilliant)

" Really really bad
","I am at a complete loss for words but I will try to do my best to summarize how I feel.<br><br>This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Now admittedly, I only watched 3/4 of it but that's all I could take. I was ready to turn it off after 10 minutes but wanted to give it a shot to see why this is the biggest movie of the year. And I am dumbfounded of why. This movie is not funny. In fact, it's sad and unfunny. This movie should have been one of those direct to video movies.<br><br>There was a group of four of us and no one laughed. Not one single person and there were two girls in the group. They thought it was really bad too, and I bet a lot of you out there think the same, but maybe are afraid to say so.<br><br>1/10 - One of the worst movies I have ever 3/4 seen.",1
" Charming, fun and we all had a laugh.
",This movie is charming and many people I know who also watched this absolutely loved it and recommended it to me. The movie was hilarious and we all had a laugh. Everybody enjoyed this and actually had fun. At the end of the movie I was left with wanting more. This movie is at least in the top 5 as it was something I didn't expect to enjoy. I thought at first that it would just another mediocre movie but I was so wrong. Somehow everything about this movie put together worked so well. Ryan Gosling as Ken and Margot Robbie as Barbie both casts did a fantastic job. I would absolutely rewatch this as it was better than I expected. I highly recommend this. This Barbie movie got everybody wearing pink and it just did everything right. Honestly hats off to all casts &amp; crew. I LOVED THIS!!!,10
" Fantastic attention to details
","This movie, about Barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence, is a good fantasy movie!<br><br>I liked the concept, and it reminded me of The Toy Story Quadrilogy (1995-2019). The dolls were living dolls, but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours. The sense of humor were present, and I noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways. Its satire was well used, and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime. The attention to details was fantastic because of the script, the action, the minor details, like eating and drinking, and last, but not least: the sets and the effects - every visual element, basically. The characters' behaviors were like they were controlled by kids, but we didn't see the kids' hands or like that. They acted like they were played with, and that was well executed, I think.<br><br>I think the story was alright. The outer story in the first and third act was good. The beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of Barbie and how Barbie has affected people before, but also how Barbie should affect us in the right way today. It's all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities, but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others' shoes, because that's how to live as a realistic, self-controlled being. The second act is a big part of a movie, and I got mixed feelings about that act in this movie. It had its meanings, but I think much of what happened, especially in Los Angeles, was sometimes messy and unnecessary. It was much small-talk, and I sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time. Anyway, it didn't ruin the overall experience.<br><br>In conclusion, this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story. The attention to detail, from the script to the visual elements, enhances the overall experience. The movie's satirical approach appeals to both children and adults, making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences. While the outer story is well-crafted, the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing. Nevertheless, the movie's exploration of Barbie's impact on people's lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable. Despite minor flaws, the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others.",7
" Amazing movie (watched it twice now)
","Having seen this movie twice now, I've laughed, I've cried and I enjoyed every minute of this movie! When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was thinking there is no way this movie will be any good! Well I am happy to say that I am wrong because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Margot Robbie was great as Barbie while Ryan Gosling was great as Ken! It also stars America Ferreira, Will Farrell and other A-List actors! It definitely has a great story line to it and the soundtrack was also amazing! For those who are skeptical about the movie, DON'T BE! I highly recommend it.",10
" A ""Barbie"" girl on the loose from her ""Barbie"" world, a fun mixed film of fantasy and reality.
","Being a boy growing up I was never a ""Barbie"" doll collector, always had mostly ""Star Wars"", ""WWF"", and ""He Man"" figures, yet I like all others knew the impact and cultural historical vibe of the Mattel toy line. This film from director Greta Gerwig which blends the toy and real worlds together, so well showing what it's like to deal with being accepted into reality with people who have loved you as a toy doll. The movie rightfully called ""Barbie"" is a fun one a real sentimental journey a film really of escape, fantasy, a touching adventure that's blended with comedy and drama. The acting and on screen chemistry is in top notch form with ""Barbie""(the beautiful and sexy attractive Margot Robbie) and ""Ken""(Ryan Gosling) as they live in the colorful and magical playland life it all seems just a dream, only when signs of malfunction and a hint that ""Barbie"" might be human the film changes. As going into the real world to search for the cure to become a toy again offers plenty of moments that have you as a viewer laughing and feeling emotions as you really along, with the central character feel the compare and contrast and weigh the choices and decisions that humans must make, and the real world even sees the ""Barbie"" toys in a different light. Overall well done good feel good entertaining film as the sets and displays of pink give escape and fun, even if you were not a ""Barbie"" collector you will enjoy this film as it provides the messages of love and acceptance.",7
" Historical Barbie Film
","As someone who played with the dolls growin up,the in-jokes and references to some rare Barbie variations and playsets are funny. The political message gives Barbie a new dimension I never thought would go to. I felt a hidden anti-war message in it actually which is deep for a toy I never thought would be taken that serious. Makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchise's history,but on rewatch I'll fast forward to the cheesy funny parts. Would I watch it again? Probably!!!!!!!! Especially after eating a pot cookie,bet this movie would look crazier! After watching I feel I'm on a Barbie kick and searching for the toys.",8
" Ryan Gosling was capping on his life
","First things first, what was good about this movie. There was no better choice for Barbie than Margot Robbie she's lovely and brilliant. Ryan is also Kenough.<br><br>Set design is amazing. Musical aspect of this movie is well done, but that's it. Other than this, the movie is mediocre at best. And certainly doesn't live up to what was promised. The biggest letdown was the script, it is trying to be something more even though it's not. If they just stick to comedy instead trying to make this story deep and powerful which makes it dump because it's poorly done and stupid. I understand were was Greta Gerwing aiming at, but why so preachy why so forced. The thing is this movie takes itself so serious at one time and then not so much at another making it a mess. I think if they just stick to the musical comedy aspect instead of overly complicated dramedy, they could have got away with it.<br><br>Overall this isn't the worst movie ever, it's still above average, the direction is good, the actors is good, everything looks good. But you will probably forget it on the way out.",6
" Misleading
","This movie was supposed to be fun light hearted watch but turns into an obnoxious headache filled with political message on and on and on.<br><br>The only Relief is honestly Ryan Gosling's Ken who made me crack up multiple times, and he lives as Ken to be honest; there is no Ryan Gosling anymore it's just Ken and he was the protagonist for me.<br><br>They really show men as cowardly, stupid, needy, power hungry and so on and on. When they showed the real world they could have shown the good and bads parts of it but only the so called patriarchy was shown; like come on. As if it's not already clear for us as audience that all men are horrible and mistreats women we are treated with many monologues of feminism. You would at least think they would go for true equal rights(the thing which actual feminists used to fight for) at the very end but Nooo! The men get satisfied with just 1 seat in that institution instead of it being half and half.",5
" Just good fun and a great soundtrack
","Even though I never played with Barbie myself, when word came out of a Barbie movie being released, I knew I had to watch it!.<br><br>With Barbie being a worldwide icon, a cast like this movie and a soundtrack like that, I still had my doubts this was going to be any good. I went to the cinema with an open mind and in the back of my head with the idea that I knew this might not be it for me.<br><br>Overall the movie is packed with some great humor and a beautiful underlying story about who Barbie really is. If you look at the cast you'll see that all the women that portray Barbie are also called Barbie, but this movie, as well as the dolls in real life show that a Barbie can be anything. Even though our main Barbie played by the magnificent Margot Robbie was the ''stereotypical Barbie'' and I did like some of the more versatile characters, I still think they could have done better than having one bigger Barbie and one in a wheelchair.<br><br>I admit that 9 is a high rating but after leaving the movie theatre 24 hours later and stil stuck with the lyrics of Ryan Gosling singing ''I'm just Ken'', I can't help but to give a solid 9.<br><br>Although this movie in any other context might be ''forgettable'', it is still a Barbie movie and it was just good fun. The humor was good, the cast was great and the soundtrack might be one of the strongest things about the movie. The outfits, especially worn by Margot Robbie were stunning.<br><br>This movie is not going to be for everyone. It was very fake, theatrical and very ''Barbie (of course).

You will laugh out loud at the clever script from Director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach.<br><br>Clearly they have done their research with every Barbie ever made and even some discontinued ones making an appearance, and of course all the accessories sold separately.<br><br>The only one missing is ""Trixie Mattel"", based on the Drag Queen of the same name.<br><br>America Ferrera shines like a diamond as ""Gloria"", one of the real humans who makes the journey to mythical Barbie Land after Barbie has an existential crisis and thinks about death.<br><br>As a grown, smart, sophisticated woman she delivers one of the best soliloquy's ever in a movie.<br><br>Will Ferrell on the hand as the ""Mattel CEO"" didn't meet the brief.<br><br>I think the role required someone more grounded who you could believe as they make the transition of discovery to this Fantasy Land where only Barbies, Kens and one Allan exist.<br><br>While Ryan Gosling is the key ""Ken"" based on Sun Lovin' Malibu Ken (1979), Simu Liu (""Kim's Convenience"", ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"") is one of the many other Ken's that populate this imaginary place of ""Kendom"" where their one and only job is to ""Beach"", but don't mistake them for lifesavers.<br><br>Rhea Perlman (""Cheers"") has only 2 scenes as someone pivotal in the success of Barbies since 1959.<br><br>Watch out for: ""Weird Barbie"" (other Barbies call her that behind her back and to her face) suitably played by Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera as ""Allan"".

" A missed opportunity
","Great visuals but the 'plot' felt like a bunch of stale ideas that the writers were desperate to include but hadn't really thought through. A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though!

" Kenchanting Kentertainment
","Based purely on having come out of one film and planning to see whatever fit in next, I went to see ""Barbie"" this weekend. There was much I enjoyed about it, but I'd have loved to have know less about it heading in.<br><br>Having previously lived a joyous and perfect life in Barbieworld, stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) starts to have intrusive thoughts about her own mortality, she discovers cellulite on her legs and her feet go flat. Having visited weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) who explains that to cure these issues, she must travel to the real world and bond with her owner. Ken (Ryan Gosling) only experiences his worth when he's seen by Barbie and, whilst not invited, accompanies her on her adventure. Whilst Barbie learns that her assumptions about Barbie's positive effect on the real world aren't at all accurate, Ken discovers a concept that can revolutionise his life, the patriarchy.<br><br>I am far from the first person to comment that ""Barbie"" is much cleverer, grown up and subversive than it might have been expected to have been, in the hands of other film makers. Gerwig though, constructed a tale that manages to be a love letter to Mattel's iconic character, an honest appraisal of the same characters legacy, a treatise of the position of women in the world, a considered look at male relationships and funny comedy at the same time. It set design and cinematography are great, as are the performances from a surprisingly Anglo-centric cast.<br><br>Why haven't I scored it even higher then? Mostly it's my fault, the film has been so dissected and meme-field on Twitter that, even though I wasn't actively looking for it, I knew many of the beats and surprises before I saw the film. I thought that perhaps the films songs could have been a touch better, I know people like them, but I can't really remember any of them just a couple of days later.<br><br>I'm annoyed, but not surprised that the lesson Hollywood seems to have immediately taken from this is not, lets let interesting and varied filmmakers have carte blanche to turn properties into interesting films, but instead it's ""movies about toys!"". I'm bracing for the wall of garbage to come, but I hope we don't forget that, as with ""The Lego Movie"" you can have a real success with a property if you believe in the creative teams.",7
" Wonderful
","I went into the theater with no expectations, somebody had told me the movie was good and I was curious, but I didn't really know what I was getting into.<br><br>This is an uncommon movie. The idea being ""we have been fooled. We were told feminism had succeeded and now we find out they had been playing with us"". To me, the use of the Barbie world and the Barbie concept is fantastic, as she's supposedly been for generations of girls, the icon, the perfect woman with the perfect life achieving all she wanted. But at the same time she has been accused of embodying all that is wrong: unrealistic expectations regarding body image etc etc. Steteotypical Barbie realizing that she's been living in a bubble and the real world is not what she has been told is simply a flawless way of transmitting the message. We are all Barbie at some point.<br><br>The actors performances are simply perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling could not have done a better job. The stenography, the colors, the clothes, everything is just a delight.<br><br>This is by far the best movie I've seen this year. I know some people find it shallow, not for children, unfunny. To them I'd say perhaps they are not evaluating the movie from the correct perspective.<br><br>Intelligent, deep and aesthetically wonderful. 10/10 from me.",10
" It swings, and it kinda hits. Kinda.
","BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.<br><br>BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its ""feminism"" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER. For a movie about a children's toy, I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. I'm not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. A lot of that is because this is a Greta Gerwig film (co-written with her partner Noah Baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.<br><br>The unconventional approach is something to admire. The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film. Robbie tackles the role very well. The story asks her to do a lot, and Robbie showcases Barbie's awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there's layers to his Ken as well. He also has a funny rivalry/banter with Simu Liu's Ken.<br><br>Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. Some highlights are Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae, Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon.<br><br>America Ferrara and Ariana Greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. Ferrara's character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you're with it or meh about it. For me personally, I honestly don't mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film's credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. It's at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.<br><br>One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn't afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while I agree with the underlying message it's very heavy handed and preachy. I connected more when the film explored the nature of Barbie's character. There's one scene that tackles Barbie's legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn't revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.<br><br>Production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. Shoutout to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer. I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design. When you're in Barbie Land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto makes the film feel like you're there. It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can't help but gaze at.<br><br>I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.<br><br>As a male, this film isn't made for me. I'm obviously not the target audience for it. However, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. It flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.<br><br>6/10.",6

Ken too much but he was really funny and you could see where he was coming from, with him always being in Barbie's shadows and all that<br><br>Speaking of Barbie, Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie, she was so perfect that now i have difficulties imagining anyone else as the role of a life action Barbie, and look, i'm not saying this is the best movie of the year but for now... it's the one i liked the most.",8

" Positively surprised
","Addresses current critical issues; basically, the movie revolves around that. The central ideas are patriarchy and female empowerment, which I believe were handled intelligently and elegantly. I was particularly surprised in this regard; I didn't expect the film to be so mature.<br><br>I also want to highlight the makeup, set, photography and choreography. Top-notch, flawless.<br><br>The context is also interesting; the script is creative, and the story is engaging, making the film much more fluid. Personally that's what I liked the most, how the fantasy and the reality interact. The actors were amazing too, and not only the main characters.<br><br>Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken, but that was expected.<br><br>As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women, but also to men sensible to women struggles. I went to watch it without expecting more than a visually beautiful film, and I left the cinema positively surprised.",8
" Corny, Watchable, But So Corny
","This review will sorta just be a barebones review. There's no spoilers because this movie doesn't really have a plot or resolution that can be spoiled. The movie starts out with a reference from 2001: a space odyssey, Which im sure went right over the target audiences heads. Then breaks into a lot of corny jokes in Barbieland. Barbieland is the best part of the movie, the Barbies performances are all hammed up, kind of like a long progressive commercial. But the acting is supposed to be corny and overacted because they're barbies so I'll accept it. Barbieland has a lot of fun moments with the songs and dances and the beach and Cena. The design of Barbieland and costumes of the Barbies and Kens is why this movie is getting this hype ans it definitely lives up to it. Margot Robbie does a good job as barbie and Gosling as Ken is by far the funniest/best part of the movie. Barbie starts her crisis and goes to the real world and everything starts to suck. Ken finding out about patriarchy is the best thing about the real w orld. The jokes in this movie were really weak, the sentimental serious parts are really boring, this movie feels like it's 2 and 1/2 hours and it's only 1h45. Will Ferrell shows up but they forgot to write jokes for him. America Ferrera gives the most genuine performance but her character is devoid of logic and ends up just giving a long lecture. Lots of the corny jokes in this movie fall completely flat, but theres so many jokes in this movie that you will laugh at least a little bit. Men are targeted in this movie and it has no idea what subtlety is, but it is a Barbie movie so i can accept that. And most importantly this movie has no conflict resolution at all, they sorta just end the movie on one last moderately silly joke. This movie was sort of just a forgettable comedy with a lot of hype before it. But hey I'm glad it brought people to theaters again and did have a message worth watching even if it was delivered rather weakly.<br><br>6.2/10.",6
" I'd probably drop it at around 1/2 if I watched it alone at home
","Attending the prepremiere of the much-anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I won't soon forget, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.<br><br>The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience, with its trendy aesthetics and themes, but it struggled to find its identity. It swung between childish and adultish elements, making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic.<br><br>In the first two-thirds of the movie, I managed to find a few moments to laugh, but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third. The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch, and I found myself almost falling asleep in the cinema.<br><br>One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience. What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audience's overwhelming obsession with everything pink. Nearly 90% of the cinema-goers were dressed in various shades of pink, and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an immersive movie experience. It did not help that movie itself was pretty average - it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes, which can be amusing on occasion. However, after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content, I was completely brain damaged .<br><br>I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie, but this certainly wasn't it. It fell into the same pit as some of Disney's live-action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material.<br><br>Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue, I wouldn't rate it more than 4 out of 10. If you're looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, this film might not be the best choice.",4
" So a great little movie!
","Honestly it's Ryan Gosling that made this movie for me and no not just the holy cow hot body! He's got such a great sense of humour so funny, him and Simu Liu just bounced off each other so well. It's a cute little fun movie if you just want a good laugh. Im still trying to understand Will Ferrells character though, it was very lame and I know he's supposed to be the antagonist but it really did not work for me.<br><br>The sets and the costumes were fantastic exactly how I imagined my Barbie used to live-😁. I think they could have dug a little deeper and done multi-era costumes, regardless it was just a lot of fun to watch!",10
" Starts well.. but then..
","Barbie made a strong start really. Loved the characters, loved the production design and love love the acting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling but then along the way something happened and the characters dev becomes confusing.<br><br>Certain characters portraying Mattel exec were added in but in the end they don't really represent anything because their characters doesn't evolve.. and for me it feels to forced to put Mattel in there as a character because of course the would like to look like they are neutral or even a solution, to which we thought, was a problem. However since in the end they practically does not do anything then you are left with the question, do we really need to see the Mattel executives in here?<br><br>It certainly feel like the script has been rewritten a few times thus the message becomes quite complicated, convoluted and confusing for general folks like me. Is it really satire or is it not? Why are the kens treated like secondclass citizens at the end and why the barbies.",6
" Absolutely powerful movie and changed my perspective on life
","This movie is not for people who cry a lot. It was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic gold.<br><br>Starting with Barbie land, it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy. While the Barbies are in control there Is a lack of violence between the Kens and the Barbies. The most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between Ryan Goslings Ken and Simu Liu's Ken. Although, the Kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like 'beach' which is a role reversal of the human world. Barbie's entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see Barbie spiral out of control.<br><br>Side note: the whole concept of weird Barbie's house is amazing, the discontinued Barbie's and Ken's are hilarious especially when you realise their backstories.<br><br>Then the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements. Under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful. Barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through. We also see Barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit. This is when Ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more. The sequences in the human world aren't as interesting as Barbie world but still keep you hooked in.<br><br>Then going back to Barbie world we see Ken's patriarchy. Unlike the Barbie's matriarchy it is completely toxic. The Barbies are all maids and 'stupid' only ever caring for the Kens. And then the Kens actually start a war with eachother over the Barbies. However the Kens are actually stupid and clearly don't see what they want. Ryan Gosling's Ken then explains to Barbie that he didn't like how he was treated before and he doesn't like the world he's built for himself now, and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world. The Barbies still run everything but they give the Kens more opportunities (the Kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions). This is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote now.....<br><br>Finally the ending where Barbie is taken away by Ruth is beautiful. This made me cry the most, watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out. This movie is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar this year more than any other.",10
" Clever, dazzling, but somewhat incoherent
","On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.<br><br>The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.<br><br>I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie. Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.<br><br>This may be down to my age and my Englishness, but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. The young and the American will probably not have this trouble.<br><br>Though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.<br><br>Ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end. I made to about two-thirds of the way through.",6
" You Ken Do It!
","Funny this was teamed with Oppenheimer because this was anything but a bomb.<br><br>I missed this that rocking opening weekend that was one of the biggest, non-sequel, event weekends in at least half-a-decade. I miss these premiere weekends for cinema, and not the MCU/Conjuring/type expected blowouts. And I'm sorry I missed this one.<br><br>I laughed almost from minute one to the end. This was one enormously hilarious and yet, thought-provoking, inventive fantasy-comedies suited for all ages. And I'm super glad Barbie really turned on itself.<br><br>Okay, more like evolved to get with the times. I do appreciate they addressed the elephant in the room concerning how unrealistic the brand Barbie is. This would've equally worked as a straight-up parody and I am happy Mattel was able to be both in on the joke and flat out address it. I remember thinking the same thing when I saw ""Hidden Figures"": EVERY YOUNG FEMALE needs to see this movie. (Yes, boys too, but for those girls still being taught Barbie is Right, they need to see this.)<br><br>She's a Barbie Girl in her Barbie World, with many more Barbies, a few Kens and one unsuccessful escape artist, Michael Cera. When our main Barbie suddenly gets her own emotion chip, she must travel to the real world to make everything go back to being perfect. But is that really her, or Ken's fate?<br><br>I wish I knew more of the background of the Barbie empire. Though, honestly, they really broke the fourth wall and spelt out a lot of the Easter Eggs which was nice. I'm still sure they included/mocked a ton of her real history.<br><br>This make-believe, almost completely void of realism movie was a real joy to watch. Some of the jokes had me rolling, the set-pieces and characters were all so much fun - not an unlikable character in the film and music/set designs alone should win Oscars. Not to mention the cast.<br><br>I have YET to see a bad Margot Robbie performance. How has she not won Oscars herself? She 100% commits to every role and gives her heart out, even in some of her bad movies. I'm not a fan of Ryan Gosling, so it was refreshing to see him step out of his normal roles and see more of his character than just the brand ""Ryan Gosling."" And the supporting cast was just as great including the hilarious Will Ferrell who steals every scene, especially when he's a second or third tier part and the always gorgeous Simu Liu who always looks so happy to be in any role he's in. He's always been a pretty boy/not-so-great actor, but I never, ever mind seeing him in anything.<br><br>This would definitely be a huge recommendation to anyone, but I know you all have already seen it. And good for you/bad for me for waiting this long. I thought I could make it to streaming...glad I took the leap. Besides I found this locally owned movie theatre with a ""private screening room,"" like for Movie Execs to experience their end-project and is now my all-time favorite movie theatre. (Roadhouse Cinemas in Scottsdale, AZ. 10/10 star place for sure.)<br><br>Very pleased I saw this and would love to do more research now with an Every-Easter-Egg vlog. And YEEEES, they played my song. Well, an updated version and I think it called for that.<br><br>(Disclaimer, I flipflopped back/forth in-between 8 and 9 stars. But, as I recalled more hilarious jokes, like my personal favorite Beach-Off scene, this is a solid 9 stars out of 10. I can't wait to see this again as there were many, many comedic and inventive humor scenes I may have missed due to my laughing.)<br><br>***<br><br>Final Thoughts: Growing up and moving around a ton in my youth, my whole world was my sister. I sometimes had friends, but mostly her girl-friends were my friends by default. I do recall playing with Barbies with them, always having/wanting to be Ken. (I wasn't a fan; I was just going with the flow.) Funny, thinking about it now, I did exactly what this movie broadcasted in the opening: I treated Ken like he was just Barbie's. I would use Ken just to ask Barbie for a cup of sugar or something stupid while trying to fit in. C'mon Ken, you're more than just a cup of sugar.<br><br>Well, except Simu Liu, he's a whole lotta Sugar.",9
" It is not groundbreaking as people claim it to be
","The 2023 Barbie movie is a whimsical and colorful adventure that aims to entertain its target audience of children but falls somewhat short for a broader viewership, warranting a 6/10 rating.<br><br>One of the film's strengths lies in its vibrant and imaginative visual design. The animated world of Barbie is brought to life with bright colors, elaborate sets, and a wide array of characters, all of which are sure to captivate young viewers. The film's commitment to creating a visually stimulating environment is evident throughout.<br><br>The film's protagonist, Barbie, is portrayed as a strong and determined character, encouraging themes of empowerment and self-confidence for young girls, which is a commendable aspect of the movie's messaging. The voice acting, led by the talented Margot Robbie as Barbie, is well-executed, bringing energy and charisma to the characters.<br><br>However, the film's narrative feels somewhat formulaic and predictable. While it's understandable that children's movies often adhere to certain storytelling conventions, this one doesn't bring much novelty to the table. The plot follows a predictable trajectory, and the conflicts and resolutions are easily foreseen.<br><br>Additionally, the humor in the film may not resonate as strongly with adult audiences, lacking the clever wit and multi-layered jokes that make family films enjoyable for viewers of all ages. This can limit the movie's appeal beyond its primary demographic.<br><br>The soundtrack and musical numbers are catchy and fun, contributing to the film's overall lively atmosphere. These moments, along with the film's positive messages of friendship and self-acceptance, are highlights that provide genuine charm.<br><br>In conclusion, the 2023 Barbie movie fulfills its intended purpose of entertaining and inspiring young audiences, particularly those who are fans of the iconic doll. Its visual design, positive messaging, and enthusiastic voice acting are commendable. However, it falls short of achieving wider appeal due to its predictable plot and humor that may not resonate with older viewers, resulting in a 6/10 rating.",6
" Plastic in the worst way possible
","It took me quite some time to decipher this movie. I felt like I was missing something, that there was more to it than first apparent. The acting, the dialogue, the sets, the costume: technically it is polished and purposeful; yet I was utterly unable to engage with it. And finally it hit me: that is because it is actually a commercial.<br><br>Moreover it is nothing else than a commercial. It doesn't deliver anything more than promote a product. Take the product away and there is nothing. Take away Barbie the brand, and the film is devoid of any substance. It's empty. Unlike the Lego movie for instance, similarly an unapologetic ad for children's toys, that managed to be a decent adventure film that celebrated the creativity that toys enable.<br><br>Barbie functions as a film but only on the most superficial ways.<br><br>It has a story, characters and lines of dialogue. And while some of the dialogue is clever and funny, and some of the characterization opens the door to some interesting character study, overall it is weighted down by the absolute obtuseness of the plot. The worst flaw is that it doesnt give anything of substance to do to Barbie, the protagonist. Almost every other character is moving the plot forward by either taking action or moving the story forward by emotional growth. Barbie herself is just a side character that goes from A to B and back to A. Physically, as well as emotionally. Ken has a far more interesting journey and arc. Gloria has a more important role in the story. Arguably even Sasha and Allen work better as characters with whom you relate and empathise.<br><br>The worst thing is that the movie is not even a commercial for the dolls. Rather it is a commercial for the idea of the doll. I don't know if we can get more post-modern than that. Barbie is not an actual doll in the movie, but she is literally the thing you think of when you describe someone as a ""Barbie"" Yet the film is very much so a commercial for Mattel's Barbie and the intellectual property it represents. I think it is crass and pedestrian. The movie is purely a corporate maneuver to pivot from one business to another, from manufacturing toys to manufacturing content.<br><br>That is why this film throws so much at the wall to see what sticks; that is why when Barbie leaves fake plastic Barbie-land, she escapes to fake plastic Los Angeles and nobody picks up on the irony. That's why they have garbage collector Barbies in a world where there is no garbage. That's why they have women Barbie doctors that aren't actual doctors and when later Ken meets a real doctor in the real world, you're waiting for a call-back that never happens.<br><br>This movie is the absolute opposite of art. To call it a film is an insult to everything we hold sacred.",4
" A Classic Screwball Comedy
","Pushing all of the serious reviews aside for a moment, this is a classic comedy of the thirties, updated for our times. Screwball comedies like ""Bombshell"" with Harlow and ""My Man Godfrey"" were wonderful satires. They centered around a battle of the sexes, with a female character dominant over the male lead. They were loaded with farcical situations and spoofing, as well as lots of physical comedy.<br><br>And like ""Christmas in Connecticut"", they often had a gentle but serious 'message' at the end, and America loved it. The woman is always smarter, generally with a plan up her sleeve, the male lead (most of the men in the movie) are oblivious. The more self-important, the more obliviousness they are to what's really going on around them. I'd now love to see Ryan Gosling in a re-make of ""It Happened One Night"", he'd be terrific. Or Margot Robbie in a re-make of ""Some Like It Hot"".",10
" If you want it, here it is. Come and get it.
","No doubt you've spent a few months hearing about Barbenheimer, referring to the simultaneous releases of Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" and Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Obviously the movies couldn't be more different. I saw ""Oppenheimer"" last weekend, as arms control experts had recommended seeing it before ""Barbie"" after all, she lives in the world that he helped bring about.<br><br>Anyway, this movie addresses the issue of how we define gender roles, and of course looks at matriarchy versus patriarchy. The plot actually reminded me of the 2007 Disney flick ""Enchanted"", with the idea of an ultra-feminine character from an apparently perfect world suddenly coming to the real world.<br><br>All in all, it's an over-the-top but enjoyable flick. You'll probably leave the theater asking yourself what it means to be a man or a woman. Along with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the cast includes America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Emma Mackey, Ncuti Gatwa, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren and Michael Cera. Therefore, the supporting cast makes this movie a link between ""Ugly Betty"", ""Kim's Convenience"", ""Sex Education"" (twice), ""Ghostbusters"", ""Anchorman"", ""Prime Suspect"" and ""Arrested Development"".",7
" Not the evil propaganda some people are saying, but also not funny and very shallow
","I just watched Barbie, it wasn't offensively bad. It was just weak, and not funny. The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.<br><br>The ""empowerment"" stuff in it is very generic, a lot of the sentiment is kid's film-level ""just be yourself and like yourself"" thinking that applies to any person, but it's only the girls in the film that make these profound ""revelations"" as they are the creative gender and the guys (in Barbie land and the ""real"" world) are all cardboard cut-out airheads.<br><br>The film is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is, it's pretty shallow and light-weight and isn't going to leave lasting impact in pop culture, good or bad, pretty forgettable really. Kids of an impressionable age will most likely just be bored by it, and most older people will see it for the weak sauce it is.",4
" Greta Gerwig never disappoints
","I hope you won't let the title of the film fool you; this is not some family movie for little girls. It is an all around auteuristic film by the ever great Greta Gerwig, and an instant classic cult film.<br><br>It provides some excellent comedy, and at the same time some very clever contemporary commentary on feminism and patriarchy from both sides, in Gerwig and Baumbach's usual styles. Very well-written overall.<br><br>The cinematography is very uqique, one might say characteristic from Gerwig, but it has its own unique weird, twisted style to it. And I love it.<br><br>Overall, a very fun film that is certainly deserving of all the praise and hype it has gotten.<br><br>Like last year's ""Everything and Everywhere all att once"", this is truly a genre-bending experience that I very much hope make it to the Oscars. It is both an incredibly fun and important film!",10
" The audiience seemed to like it
","Everything is perfect in Barbieland. Every day is identikit pink perfection for all the Barbies, and also for the Kens as long as they're getting attention. Then stereotypical Barbie starts getting dark thoughts, which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the Real World. So, accompanied by Ken, Barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human, only to find that the Real World is not at all like Barbieland. And Ken discovers patriarchy. And horses.<br><br>As a film, this is an enjoyable mess. It aims to be toy nostalgia for little girls of all ages, escapist silliness, wild fantasy, social satire with well-staged musical production numbers, in fact a bizarre mix of elements which shoukdn't work together, but somehow do. It's bright, colourful, tuneful, quite funny, well played, sometimes thoughtful and thought-provoking, mikdly feminist (though not without taking pokes at feminism and vacuous femininity as well as toxic masculinity) and, broadly, good-hearted. Helen Mirren's narration is dry and funny, and the last line is a killer.<br><br>Looking at the film as a social phenomenon, I have two observations. One, a lot of people have got their knickers in a twist, and they are mostly males who feel very threatened by the mildly feminist message in this movie ABOUT DOLLS. This film is not is big a deal as it thinks it is, and it's certainly not as big a deal as wounded males seem to think it is. Two the cinema was packed (two-thirds female) and the audience seemed to enjoy it. The only films I have seen filling cinemas in recent years have been aimed at female audiences. No comment!",7
" The ""American Psycho"" of this generation.
","Barbie is one of those few films that are able to merge an extremely unreal and borderline bizarre environment with an immensely grounded and hyperreal take on society successfully, and still be massively entertaining.<br><br>The script is one of the finest in the history of film and demands supreme attention of the audience, not just to the surface level occurrences and dialogues but also to the underlying subtext (paralleling American Psycho).<br><br>Contrary to the general consensus, this is very much a coming-of-age movie through the eyes of a young girl. Barbie has an idealistic and perfect outlook towards life which gets crushed and she is forced to accept, then gradually embrace and finally manoeuvre through.<br><br>The film is also vastly political in nature (not just gender but otherwise too), compelling the idealistic society to realise how fractured their own internal workings are resulting in them implementing real life political resolutions to their systems.<br><br>There are so many more layers to peel off of the writing which elevates this movie from a straightforward comedy/satire to a film that deserves to be broken apart piece by piece and studied extensively for generations to come (sooo very similar to American Psycho).<br><br>And finally, Ryan Gosling does indeed deliver the absolute most sublime performance of his career.",10
" Awkward, brilliant, anti-popcorn movie
","The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.<br><br>As it plays out, the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab. It's a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. It's not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.<br><br>But then, something interesting happens: Barbie actually starts landing some punches. It's no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman. And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. She's small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. In Barbie, she's a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.<br><br>These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baumbach's films combined with topics that have defined Gerwig's features, yet the movie doesn't work like anything the two have accomplished separately. Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it's rival blockbuster (Oppenheimer, of Oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone's attempt at pretension) simply can't manage. The film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.<br><br>It's a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry, and while her performance really isn't particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. Robbie, like Charlize Theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as ""average"" while begging us to see her as just that. It's a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. It's a joke Robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star Ryan Gosling owns.<br><br>I like watching actors having fun onscreen. I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. Both fall flat. We've seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Storys and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. They almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. But Robbie and America Ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Gerwig's best instincts. There are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.<br><br>Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. At just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we're supposed to understand is the source of Barbie's angst. In that, the ending isn't a reach so much as a confident nod to where Gerwig has taken the audience. If it's rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film, it's especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is.",7
" You're Kenough y'all!
","Went in to see for Margot Robbie, left giving flowers to Ryan Gosling<br><br>Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a one of a kind type of movie and arguably the movie of the summer. Greta brings the world of Barbie to life with its visually dazzling cinematography, amusing soundtrack and choreographies, and lively, hot pink set pieces. The film's satire commentary tackles on sexism, societal norms, and existentialism that will connect with the viewers while also give them a good amount of chuckles here and there. And last and certainly not least, the entire ensemble brought their Barbie and Ken game with Robbie and Gosling giving Oscar worthy performances. Barbie is a movie I'd watch in theaters!",9
" It's alright
","I have seen this film in theaters twice now and I can safely say that I thought it was amusing, entertaining, and fun. However, I won't lie to you and say that it's really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn't a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a ""good movie"" with. Now I can't say that I wasn't entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women's issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an ""everyone movie"", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don't get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of ""Barbieland"". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they're toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn't want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to ""do anything to see it in theaters again"", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not.",7
" They Overdid It
","The movie starts off great, and has hilarious jokes throughout. For me, Ryan Gosling stole the show as he had the funniest lines and scenes. Some folks are mad about the women's empowerment themes, not me. Men have treated women as less than equal since the dawn of time, who are we to complain when they rightfully mock that? I don't mind the shots at the patriarchy, or even the fact that there's not one intelligent male character in the entire thing. What I don't like about this movie is Barbie's existential crisis. It's like they forgot the audience majority are children, and it feels like a pathetic bid for an Oscar. That arc was as off-putting as it was unnecessary. Had that element been replaced with more humor or at least a wholesome resolution, I would've given it a much higher score. They just took it to a place where it's less relatable for the children watching.",5
" Genius! We need more movies like this one!
","Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.<br><br>Gerwig's direction is brilliant, balancing humor and heart with a sharp eye for detail and a playful sense of style. The film is full of witty references, clever jokes, and hilarious situations that poke fun at the absurdity and contradictions of Barbie's culture, while also honoring its legacy and appeal. The cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning, creating a vibrant and immersive visual experience that contrasts the artificiality of Barbieland with the realism of the human world.<br><br>Robbie's and Gosling's performance is outstanding, capturing both the innocence and the sass of Barbie, as well as her growth and transformation. Gosling shines so bright in this. His song is chef's kiss! They are supported by a stellar ensemble. Barbie is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a smart and subversive commentary on gender, beauty, identity, and consumerism, as well as a tribute to the power of imagination, creativity, and individuality. It is a film that proves that anyone can be anything they want to be, as long as they are true to themselves. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 rating. The Godfather of whatever this movie's genre is....",10
" So self-congratulatory
","It's taken me a couple of days to ponder over what I really thought of this movie. That's a plus, in that it really made me think. However the more I think about it, the more turned off I am by the whole thing.<br><br>Pros: The style is pretty fresh, and I was happy to see an original movie do well at the box office. Ryan Gosling was hilarious and nailed the balance between tongue-in-cheek and taking it super seriously. Simu Liu was great too. Taken by themselves, so many of the scenes were spot-on and funny, but the movie as a whole was just too much. That leads me to the negatives.<br><br>Cons: Some of the Barbieland kitsch went on for too long and started to give me a headache. In the beginning when that song started up again for perfect day #2, I thought my brain was going to melt. The narrator was funny at first and then got annoying, especially when she started breaking the 4th wall. Some of the monologues (mainly THE monologue) would have read just fine as blog posts or opinion columns. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've read it before. In the movie it started coming across as buzzword-filled lecturing. I cringed whenever Barbie had a feminist lightbulb moment and used the academic-turned-popular jargon. Eventually it was like they were trying to get extra credit for using vocabulary words. Amusing at first, but got old fast.<br><br>Finally, ironically, I (a mom...a very pregnant mom) went to see this movie with my own mom. For all the different kinds of Barbies out there, one type of identity Barbie isn't allowed to have is Mother. The repeated gag where everyone cringes at Midge, the briefly shown ""pregnant friend"", told me this movie really wasn't for me. The film took pains to show women of almost every description and identity category in positions of power in Barbieland, but the ""mom friend"" was the actual, unironic butt of the joke. I get it, she's an awkward footnote in Barbie history. She DOESN'T fit into the Barbie message as stated in the film. I could've brushed it off as tongue-in-cheek like the rest of the movie, but it went further. That line: ""We mothers stand still so our daughters can see how far they've come""? That shows me where mothers belong in this world. On the sidelines. Forever in the background, just a plot device. Or a joke. If you HAVE to have children, at least relegate yourself to your rightful role as the picture on the wall, history that no one wants to repeat. Even this movie, that satirizes the roles typically played by women in popular media by reversing the role onto Ken, still manages to keep one huge group of women in the-what shall we call it?-Ken-zone.",6
" Lack of Depth
","Let's start with what I enjoyed. The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn't enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.",5
" It's beautiful.
","This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece.",10
" A Barbie World?
","I am so torn, on this movie. There is no doubt, that Barbie is beautifully made movie, with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team. Margo Robbie was born to play Barbie and lets be honest Ryan Gosling stole the entire movie. Then again I can't think of a single cast Member I didn't like. The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either. I think the target audience will love it, and lets be honest thats not me.",6
" 🌸🌸🌸🌸
",I couldnt wait for this to come out and when it did i saw it on the day of the release and ohh my everyone clapped and cheered at the end and in the uk no one ever does that but anyway i went with boys and girls and all of them enjoyed it i think truly it puts a message forward which might sound cringe but i dont care but everything about it was so good the acting was phenomenal the casting was amazing the cinematography the music just so good oh my god ive seen it a couple of times now and each time i finished the movie i was so happy for the rest of the day i was dancing and skipping around anyway i love this movie a lot.,10
" Are we still in the 60's lol?
","I feel like we as a society can't move past our parents and grandparents battles... women in first world civilizations have it better than ever (spoiler alert, it'll only get so good). Movie would have had a great message 60 years ago.<br><br>I liked the originality of the movie, I would've preferred the movie to revolve around weird Barbie as the main character, I think the humour and weirdness could've been cranked up a lot more!<br><br>I really think we should stop telling kids that they are more than they are. My generation was told that we are all different and special, look where that led lol. Let's be honest with each other, we live on a paradise planet, but we'd rather succumb to our worst impulses, greed, lust, etc, etc, rather than evolve and live too the standards we wish we could achieve. Rich and beautiful people rule the Earth, the rest of us work for them willingly. It is the Kens, Barbies, and the Mattel type CEOs who have the planet (for some reason we are okay with that)..<br><br>Barbie isn't a billion dollar movie because of its message, thank the beautiful people who are cast and the originality/nostalgia of it!",7
" I just love it.
","This movie really is what I needed. The casting is perfect, Ryan Gosling as Ken nobody would've think it would be that good. I really had a fun time with a lot of laughs, yes there is a serious undertone in this movie about the diffference between women&amp;men but it's given also in a fun way. America Ferrera is giving a bombing acting like she always does! Margot Robbie is just wauw, she is made for this role, i'm so glad she got the role and not Amy Schumer as previously requested. I would die to see the movie again for the first time, for now I will just wait for it to come on streaming and will stream it again! We are Kenough.",10
" Entertaining
","The Barbie movie brilliantly brings to life the magical universe of Mattel's iconic Barbie dolls, with Margot Robbie's exceptional portrayal of Barbie herself at the forefront. Robbie's performance is truly remarkable, capturing the essence of the beloved character with grace and charm. Her embodiment of Barbie's timeless appeal and elegance goes beyond mere physical resemblance.<br><br>Robbie effortlessly transitions between the enchanting Barbieland and the real world, showcasing her versatility as an actress. As she navigates the fantastical landscapes of Barbieland or adjusts to the complexities of the real world, Robbie's portrayal remains captivating and genuine.<br><br>Supported by Ryan Gosling's charismatic depiction of Ken, the film creates a delightful blend of humor, heart, and subtle social commentary. The visuals are a visual treat, capturing the vibrant beauty of Barbieland and the dynamic real-world settings.<br><br>Furthermore, the movie subtly touches on various themes, adding depth to the narrative and making it not only entertaining but also thought-provoking.<br><br>While some viewers might have hoped for a deeper exploration of the dynamics within the Mattel company, the overall experience remains highly enjoyable. The Barbie movie, led by Margot Robbie's outstanding performance, serves as a wonderful celebration of the iconic doll and the values she embodies. It's a must-watch that reignites our fascination with Barbie and leaves us inspired by the boundless possibilities she represents.",7
" Could Woulda Shoulda
","Alas, my high hopes were crushed. When i heard about this project, I saw the opportunity, and expected, rather hoped for, an utterly ridiculous over the top comedy where dollified actors could come up with some novel situations. I wanted to see what kind of comedic chops Gosling would trot out. Instead, after a razzmatazz showbiz intro, dancing dolls and high energy, the sad, busy, and quizzical plot unfolds as a very sorry melodrama. An emotionally vulnerable and beautiful but pitiful Barbie, and a truly oafish Ken, have passed through a ""Dimensional Membrane"" onto the earth plane, into a reality just as bizarre and unrealistic as the Barbie-Dimension, and the two doll-humanoids find themselves maladaptive and disliked, even persecuted. And they have come looking for a solution to an unpleasant sort of problem. This just isn't funny. It's pretty much a reworking of Judy Garland in OZ, way out of her element, trying to find the Ruby Slippers. In fact, it was a deformation of her feet as a Doll in Barbieland, that kicks off this whole sorry setup. Now I have to ask myself why I was expecting a comedy? Well, because the advertising suggested something ludicrous. When you see Will Ferrell doing pratfalls and the entire surreal pink Landscape of Barbie Land, Gosling with idiotic facial expressions and gestures, and Barbie presented as a very sexualized Super-Bimbo, sort of a witless Mae West, (who was very witty), I thought some very funny stuff was coming down the pike. Nope. I wouldn't say avoid it, but I would say it never really finds it's tone, and doesn't live up to its advertised premise. The crowd around me wanted to laugh, that was clear, and was struggling to find something funny in things that just weren't. This must have cost a fortune to produce. The money could have been better spent.",3
" It's heartwarming
",It's nice to have a movie that's fun and interesting dialogue. I knew the style of the movie by the scenes I'd seen leaked online I think that in itself is not everyone's style but boy it's unique and very barbieland. A lot of thought went into this and it's not just for women it's for anybody. We all need an Allan in our life. I could've used more boardroom ceo scenes with will farrel and his men tho. It's lovely to see the perspective of both men and women and at the end of the day what I got from this movie is about how we're each wanting to find our happiness and who we are outside of someone else.,10
" Had no right to be as good as it was
","I remember when a 'Barbie' movie was announced thinking to myself what a disaster that is going to be. So I was pretty surprised when the film finally came out and the feedback was glowingly positive for the most part. I don't think the film was as good as some people have made it out to be, but it was certainly a lot better than the concept had any right to be.<br><br>The film is at its best when it is trying to be light-hearted and funny. There are some genuinely funny and clever jokes in this film. Simple stuff most of the time, but done in a way that actually made me laugh out loud. If the movie had kept this tone for the entire run time it could've been a true classic.<br><br>But in the second half of the movie things change. It decides it needs to make a point and the movie gets weighed down and loses steam as it tries to do this, ultimately limping to the finish line.<br><br>At it's best this film is very good. It gets every drop out of the concept and for that it should be commended. 7/10.",7
" Pointing out sexism by being sexist
","I was never into Barbie as a child because I thought she's just a boring toy. The operative word being - toy. So when the controversy started about her impossibly small waist, sky high beauty standards, white skin and blonde hair, I thought some people just have too much time on their hands or because they're just jealous at someone else's success. It's easier to blast someone else's hard work rather than strike it out on your own and keep doing it.<br><br>The way children perceive toys remain unchanged. A young child who picks up a Barbie will not immediately think (if at all) they must aspire to have the doll's physique. Children play with toys out of enjoyment and by using their innocent imagination, they don't think about the underlying message or intention behind every toy. The politicising comes from some adults who can scream the loudest and longest. Ruth Handler created Barbie after seeing her daughter playing with a paper doll, she wasn't into politics or trying to change cultural standards.<br><br>Gerwig's Barbie is an example of an adult using a doll to scream her many, many lectures to the masses. The movie looks like it's for children and teenagers but the script is the opposite. This is where it becomes confusing and the storyline thin. Too many speeches aiming at the patriarchy control, pointing out that it's a sexist world controlled by men but showing all men in this movie as idiots.<br><br>The portrayal of men is very black and white stereotyping. Barbie (Robbie) goes into the real human world and she's heckled by men at the beach and if that's not a clear enough message, she visits a construction site where, you guessed it, the men starts to make derogatory comments as well. Then there's the Mattel HQ where it's of course run by men in suits who are naturally, idiots. One of the lower ranked male employee (Swindells) even say, ""I'm a man with no power, does that make me a woman?"" (What's with half of the Sex Education actors cast in this movie. The brilliant Ncuti Gatwa playing a hetero Ken!?)<br><br>At just under two hours, you can guess why that is - there's not much else going for it so the soundtrack plays a big part in driving the narrative to the point, you're wondering if this is a movie or a music channel. The second half descends into a weird but clumsy attempt at humour that a child would find boring.<br><br>Robbie and Gosling do a decent job with the flat material they were given. Barbie is an iconc doll and that's all she is, a toy - so a movie keeping to that theme without the controversy would have been more entertaining. And in case you're so numb from all the preachiness, the Trump and his wall sideswipe under a guise of a joke shows how the writers just wanted to cover as many 'isms' as possible by using Barbie as a prop.",3
" Full of Surprises
","This movie, wow. Just wow. This was unlike anything I had expected going in to seeing Barbie earlier today. I figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between Barbie and Ken with it ending with them getting together, beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever after<br><br>Boy was I wrong. Holy moly, Barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking, at least to me it was deep and thought provoking. I mean seriously, this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie. Yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times. But the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following - self identity, discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life. It is ok to be imperfect, to be weird, kooky, dark, it's ok to not live up to anyone's expectations in life or those around you. Just be you and only you. Self love. Willing to accept change even if you dont like it. There's also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mix<br><br>It's funny, heartwarming, filled with unexpected surprises and Im sure for all the hardcore Barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant movie<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did an exceptional job as Barbie and Ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time. Ryan Gosling as Ken especially is definitely one of the main highlights of the movie as you can tell he had fun in the role as Ken.",10
" Ryan Gosling is the main character
","Ryan Gosling acting was so good that is seemed that he as Ken is the main character.<br><br>Physically Margot was a great choice, but she didn't give much. Even when she had the opportunity to act more human, her expressions and acting were still more as a doll, and Ryan did a better job.<br><br>I didn't know what to expect but I was hoping that it will not be too superficial, and it wasn't. The movie is light, with some smart things said. It was a bit too long and became little boring in the middle but after all it was fun to watch. Loved the music, costumes, choreography. Girls can relate to many things said in the movie, and I recommend you to watch it in girls company, you will have fun.",7
" An Ode to the Love of Cinema
","Wow. I saw this movie on July 23rd and I've been thinking about it ever since. Right off the bat, the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design. The backdrops, the houses, all of the set decoration in Barbieland is PERFECTION. All of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative. I would love to believe that Barbie can help usher in a new era, where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage, without so much CGI. Set Dec is 10/10<br><br>Next, I have to talk about Greta Gerwig's clear love of cinema. From the opening sequence that starts with a perfect 2001: A Space Odyssey parody which they absolutely nailed, to a hilarious Matrix reference, and then the overarching clear love of old Hollywood and especially those old school classic musicals. The dance and musical numbers here are just an absolute BLAST!<br><br>Then there is the acting. It almost feels wrong to say it, but there's no denying that Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in. His comedic timing is a triumph and the fact that we haven't gotten to experience more of this in his film history is a travesty. Margot Robbie is absolute perfection, the most obvious casting for Barbie ever in the history of the world, but don't let that fool you. Her balance between comedy and the emotional scenes are unmatched by anyone else here. She really is one of the best actor of this generation. The rest of the cast also absolutely kills it. America Ferrera Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Will Farrell, etc etc etc, everyone holds their own in this incredible ensemble performance. Acting is 10/10<br><br>THE MUSIC!!!! It is so iconic and obvious and perfect that we get a full original Barbie album for this film. I'm not always a hard pop music kind of person, but it went so perfectly with this film, that I had to order myself a vinyl copy. But best of all, Ryan Gosling's performance in ""I'm Just Ken."" The dance sequence in this one is so freaking fun and good and hilarious. I can only pray that it is nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars so that we can be blessed with a live performance of this gem, can you imagine it?!? Music is 10/10<br><br>And finally, the script. See how I managed to make it this far in the review without even bringing up what all of those insecure baby men on the internet seem to only be able to focus their tiny brains on? This script is hilarious, SO smart and witty, and deeply poignant and emotional. It hits home so hard on so many points while still being able to poke fun at this doll that has captivated the imagination of children for the last 64 years. I love that even though Barbie has caught some heat in the last decade or so for destroying the body image of women everywhere(I personally did not find that to be the case for me, I was perfectly happy to compare myself to all of the other fellow 10 year old girls in my age group to do that for me) we are able to also look at how the ambitions of this doll, all of her careers, the fact that there was an Astronaut Barbie before there was a woman working at NASA, etc. Then of course the dreaded wish to take down the patriarchy!! If anything in this movie seemed false or offended you, I don't even know what to tell you. This felt like a very real and true example of what its like to walk through this world as a woman. So many women have shared America Ferrera's monologue, and the entire set of scenes after that were some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie. And I say that as a big Matchbox Twenty fan!<br><br>All in all, this movie for me is a masterpiece, it's stunning, hilarious, emotional and the most fun I may ever have had in a movie theatre. Cannot recommend strongly enough! Easily my favourite movie of 2023, can't imagine how anything else could come close.",10
" The clash of the decade
","Barbie vs Oppenheimer, was an amazing event to take place, if you want to say they were even going against each other, it was very enjoyable to see this take place though.<br><br>But as for Barbie the movie was okay in my opinion, it was no doubt hilarious and joyful, I would probably rewatch it for that reason. But the movie itself just kind of lacked something, I think the story was okay, had some good messages. Some parts just didn't work well, the storyline of the daughter didn't make sense, because one scene she's mean and terrible then all of the sudden she's nice, just didn't work that well.<br><br>But overall it was just okay, probably won't watch it again.",6
" The resurrection of the Barbie franchise and a philosophical existential and social reflection
","Barbie's first live action movie revives the name of the toy franchise created by Mattel that after many years seemed to be forgotten along with other titles like Max Steel. This film manages to revive this franchise by presenting us with a magical world made up of many of the versions of Barbie and Ken that have been made throughout history. Barbieland recreates many of the elements and characteristics of the toys that marked the childhood of many girls. The movie is quite colorful, cartoony and wacky, with a rather childish goofiness and cartoonish humor that can if it can make some people cringe. She has all the femininity that has always characterized the Barbie franchise and becomes feminine enough to respect the vision of the franchise, while adapting to current times. Margot Robbie is very charismatic in her role as Barbie and Ryan Gosling manages to play a very nice Ken.<br><br>As Barbie and Ken begin their great adventure into the real world, the film begins to gradually turn deep and philosophical, raising existential and social questions. In Barbieland everything is happiness and a dream land, but the real world is the opposite, this being a symbolism about discovering that reality is not as one imagines or dreams. Topics such as paradigm shifts, gender roles and human identity beyond being a man or a woman are also touched on. Barbie comes to question a lot about what her purpose is and Ken feels so isolated that he tries to be much more in a world where Barbies have had everything in their hands. The fundamental message that this film ends up being the human identity that exists beyond being a man or a woman, whose purpose is only defined by what society or social groups dictate. Barbie is clearly a movie that can generate different interpretations, that some will see it in a positive or negative way, but that makes it very clear the true and only message that this movie has and it is like the ideologies or positions implemented by society or groups Social networks have created a division about what to be or what to be, ignoring human identity. It not only questions right-wing ideas, but also left-wing ideas at the same time in the form of satire. In conclusion, Barbie is not only a film that gloriously revives the franchise and awakens some nostalgia in those who played with the toys or grew up with the animated films, it is a philosophical work on how society itself implants ideas or illusions that They make us forget our identity as human beings and who we really are, questioning our very existence. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",9
" Conflict Barbie
","Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.<br><br>Despite that, the film doesn't target kids but rather adults who once played with Barbies. For the moms out there, it's definitely a movie worth watching.<br><br>However, I'm conflicted because it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to accomplish. With so many themes and stories to tell, it somewhat detracts from the overall impact. Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable experience that nostalgically brings back memories. I'd give Barbie The Movie a rating of 7.5/10. The hype, dressing up, and reliving childhood memories add to its appeal.",7
" Glitzy and preachy
","This is not a movie to take your 10 year old girl to. On the surface it looks flashy and appealing, but if you listen to the messages you start to realise that it is preaching. And in the least subtle way you could think of.<br><br>There are a few funny moments, but not enough for it to be considered to be a comedy. And as far as the depth of the 'message' is concerned, all I can say to the writers and director is: do not give up your day job.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with delivering an important message, however, to be effective it must be done with persuasion and not a sledgehammer. This movie does not understand that.",2
" Surprisingly Good
","I wasn't expecting much, but this movie is great! It's a smart comedy. The film is clearly feminist, but it is NOT ""preachy"" as some other reviewer complained. Yes, there is one speech, but it's not made by a Barbie. It fits into the story.<br><br>The film mines the Barbie and Ken existence of ""life"" as a plastic doll for comedic effect, with some song and dance sequences as a bonus. But it's mainly about an existential crisis for the main Barbie (Margot Robbie), who travels to the ""Real World"" to resolve her crisis. Events in both the ""Real World"" and the Barbie world drive the plot, which concerns the collision between the ideal and the real. The dramatic conflict centers on the contradiction between the ideal world of the Barbies and the disappointing, yet also tempting, reality of our world--the Real World. I thought the last scene was perfect and perhaps slyly politically incorrect. You can judge for yourself. I only didn't like the music played over the end credits. The song and dance numbers in the film were entertaining though.",9
" Replace the big names with people with simialr acting chops.......will people still watch and praise this??
","This movie had top notch marketing. So good that I went to see it although I had doubt about whether it will be actually good. At the end I did not like it that much.<br><br>Nothing can be said about the quality of acting to be honest. The actors did a tremendous job across the board. Margot was superb. A few of the supporting actors were also great. Gosling's portrayal of Ken was hilarious.<br><br>I'm no expert in movie making but to me the set design, costume design overall making of the movie looked very good but the beef I have is with the story. To me it didn't felt good enough. It was weird to say the least. I know asking for logic is too much in this particular world but there should be some for it to be enjoyable. The events that took place in the real world was ridiculous to say the least.<br><br>I was just thinking if all the big names were replaced with new actors who lets just say acted at the same level of the big names, would people even watch this and talk this highly about it? In my mind the answer was no.........And I guess that's enough to describe it.",6
" Meh...
","Well, I have to admit that all the hype around this movie eventually made me sit down to watch it together with my wife and son. And my son quickly lost interest in the movie and left, and I have to admit that my interest in the movie was waning and dissipating about the halfway marker.<br><br>Yeah, this movie is seriously over-hyped and it is amped up to be all that and then some, when, in fact, it wasn't all that and a bag of potato chips. I found the storyline in the movie to be rather bland and pointless, and thus found very little entertainment in the movie. And that made sitting through 114 minutes of it quite the ordeal. Yet, I managed to endure, because I wanted to see if there was anything to the hype. So writers Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach didn't exactly impress me with this movie.<br><br>There wasn't!<br><br>Sure, the movie had a good cast ensemble, and there were some fair performances. But it was just difficult to abhor from the lack of an interesting storyline and script to enjoy the acting performances.<br><br>Visually then director Greta Gerwig certainly managed to make it look and feel like it took place in Barbieland, with all the vibrant colors, toy-like appearances of things. So that definitely helped to make things a bit more bearable to sit through.<br><br>""Barbie"" is not a childrens movie, which you would otherwise assume from a movie based on Mattel's popular doll line.<br><br>Right, well I can check ""Barbie"" off of the watched-movie list now, and I can honestly say that I am never returning to watch it a second time. And if this movie spawns a sequel, I doubt it very much that I will actually sit down to watching it.<br><br>My rating of ""Barbie"" from director Greta Gerwig's 2023 movie ""Barbie"" lands on a four out of ten stars.",4
" Loved it!
","Barbie comes to life and is surprised by all the possibilities after a life pre-determined. She goes on an adventure in the real world with new friend Madeline. The film celebrates finding oneself and believing in one's potential, with Barbie learning there is no single path laid out and she has the power to write her own story. The film takes Barbie out of her traditional Dreamhouse setting and puts her in the real world for the first time. This allows her to experience what life has to offer beyond what she was perhaps accustomed to. Visually the film looks colorful and upbeat with a focus on Barbie's journey of self-discovery in a real world setting she's unfamiliar with.",10
" Strange film - like Twilight Zone or Black Mirror
","Barbie is a weird film that is pretty well made. It tells the story of how one of many Barbie's in Barbie-land leave and go into the real world to find the person who owns them as a toy. In the real world, they see what impact Barbie has, or fails to have, as a product on the minds of young girl consumers. This information changes her, and Ken's opinion of themselves and they return home and deal with the aftermath of this revelation.<br><br>Barbie is well played by Margot Robbie who is an excellent actress and is perfectly cast in the role. While Ryan Gosling is a strange choice for Ken he does adequate work as Ken and gives depth and subtext to the otherwise shallow one dimensional Barbie-companion.<br><br>This movie poses a lot of questions, makes some strange decisions, and has some intelligent (albeit shallow) things to say about the relationship between boys and girls. (Not men and women, but boys and girls.).<br><br>It's worth watching - but memorable more in how weird it is rather than how good it is.",6

It questions gender roles in a fluid way, and brings existential questions to the fore.<br><br>By the way, I don't understand the opinions of those who didn't like the film because it promoted feminism.

" Fantastic Concept, Plastic Execution
","Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023<br><br>MILD spoilers ahead.<br><br>""Barbie,"" directed by Greta Gerwig, is one of the most bizarre films in recent memory. A popular toy tailored at young girls gets a chance at being one of the year's best films. Its whimsical, funny marketing alongside its promising cast would suggest such. Unfortunately, the film botches that opportunity, but still has some fun moments. Even though it is not as funny as many other comedies, the film manages to stay in one's head after leaving the theater.<br><br>From its colorful presentation to its glowing characters, Barbie's opening proposes that the movie will be roaringly entertaining. The music is great, the narration pokes fun at the Barbie brand, and the events are overly silly. Margot Robbie does a superb job at capturing the zany but stiff expressions one would expect from Barbie. Accompanying her is the equally funny Ken, who is played by Ryan Gosling. The two are fun to watch and their adventure appears to be one enjoyable time!<br><br>Despite the promising opening, the film, like cheap plastic, breaks apart very quickly. Once Barbie and Ken go to the real world, the jokes are lazy and subplots are underexplored. The picture's demographic is also confusing. What looked like a kids' film with humor adults can enjoy ends up giving discomforting questions parents have to discuss with their children. (For example, what a penis or a vagina means.) The sporadic sexual humor lacks a proper set up which makes for a lackluster punchline, resulting in cringey moments that, at the moment, raise questions for who this film is tailored for.<br><br>""Barbie"" also suffers from being a mostly directionless film, as its plot is unfocused but its message is very prominent. It sets up around three plotlines that were likely pitched individually and crams them all into one story with none of these concepts receiving their proper conclusions. It makes for a frustrating ending. The moral is also confusing and seems to spark more of a negative message than a positive one. Instead of the conflicts being resolved where everyone lives in harmony, it is a tug-o-war on which sex has the right to be selfish. It may make some viewers, especially impressionable children, think lower of both sexes or believe their gender is superior or inferior to the other. It may also cause some unnecessary dispute on the internet.<br><br>How characters grow is another misstep from Gerwig. Many characters do not develop gradually, but abruptly. Barbie, Ken, and two other leading characters are almost unrecognizable to their third-act counterparts. It is difficult to root for any of them as they all aim to achieve their selfish desires instead of coming up with a plan where everyone is happy. If the characters were likable and the overall message was less overboard, it could have matched the quality its marketing advised.<br><br>Even if it is a bit of a disappointment, there were some laugh-out-loud moments. Fourth-wall breaking jokes were well placed and parodies of other films or events were a joy. The production and music almost make up for the aimless story as it stays true to the brand but also makes the newer ideas feel fresh and organic. The choreography in some sequences is exceptional and, like its presentation, reinstates how fun Barbie and friends can be when it treats itself as a lighthearted comedy. It really could have been great if it were to stay in one direction.<br><br>Barbie - 65/100
Barbie is a colorful, occasionally brilliant, but misguided comedy.",6
" Barbie is everything
","Greta Gerwig, you've done it again. There's a reason this movie has become such a phenomenon in modern culture and that's because it's always been a hit!<br><br>The writing is absolutely genius with the right mix of attention-to-detail and suspension of disbelief for the imagination. The cast is so random but that makes it perfect, there's a Barbie or Ken for everyone no matter what. Their acting is superb too, everyone's line delivery left me cracking up each time.<br><br>Go to the cinema and watch this film - I was fortunate enough to go to a screening where everyone shared my excitement and there were cheers in the crowd and applause at the end. It's an experience I will never forget. Thank you Greta Gerwig for my life.",10

But eventually, my kid goes on about it at length and the cultural fervor starts getting the the ol' curiosity piqued. So, here we are ...<br><br>And it delivers; I think it's a fun movie with great dance numbers, phenomenal sets and excellent performances from both Robbie and Gosling. I love the use of practical effects in creating a living playset, and most of the jokes at Mattel's expense land pretty well.<br><br>The most common criticism I've heard is that it's preachy; and maybe it is. All I can say for certain is that it spoke to everyone in my household (we're all feminists here). We can probably all agree it is a lot better than a Mattel movie has any right to be and honestly, Margot Robbie is fantastic.",7
" Not written well enough
","I thought the storyline of this movie was not well structured. The first act was mostly fun with some genuine humor. We see Barbie living in a world that looks like the toys brought to life. When she decides to go to the ""real world,"" it disrupts life for the residents of toyland. We also learn that many girls resent Barbie dolls because of the unrealistic expectations they set for females. Then, the conflict shifts completely to the male dolls taking over the Barbie world and treating the women poorly. So now there are two competing storylines, and as the characters work to resolve both issues, we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself. It gets very muddled and isn't much fun at this point. I thought they should have kept it simple, because they seemed to be on the right track early on.",4
" Greta Gerwig Masterpiece
","A fun and clever enough comedy and twist on the world's most famous doll with wonderful production values, a charming Margot Robbie and an absolute hilarious Ryan Gosling.<br><br>Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.<br><br>Cinematography is great here, Set pieces are outstanding and the Soundtrack is a masterpiece.<br><br>I want to take a minute to take about Greta Gerwig she is so clever and talented hope this movie will push her to direct big blockbuster movies that she deserves.",8
" Definitely enjoyable
","I initially thought this movie was this movie was about Barbie finding out that she was a toy, but she actually already knows that! Anyway, this movie was about Barbie getting real emotions and going to the real world to find the girl (revealed to be a grown woman) who's playing with her Barbie toy wrong. There's a halfway plot switch, as the second half is about Ken (well, the Kens) taking over Barbieland and changing it to Kenland. I admit that the second half isn't as good as the first. The movie probably could have been trimmed by twenty minutes and it would have been better. Will Ferrell is in this, but the problem is that he isn't used more.<br><br>Wait, he was in ""Stranger Than Fiction"", a movie about a guy who found out his life was being controlled by a writer. He was in ""The Lego Movie"" as the father of a son playing Legos who found out they were alive. Now he's in this movie about Barbie finding out her purpose. Is this all the same character?! Anyway, the Kens aren't really villains and it's nice to see such a beautiful looking movie with great costumes, some great jokes and a fairly unique setup. Yes, the ""Barbie Girl"" does appear as a remix in the credits! ***",7
" WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SEEING????
","This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the ""I am woman"" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta =&gt; This is not your ticket to the Oscars.",3
" Barbie is On Her Way to the Oscars
","When I first knew there was a Barbie movie in production, a live action, I thought ""It should be as bad as the others movies""...
When I notice was Greta Gerwig making the movie, my expectation get higher.

It's a never seen thing. It compares the women's mistreatment, the real tragedy's... it's a real good idea...
Everything in this movie is really good. Go watch this movie. It deserves you attention.",9
" Forget the advertising, it's a Barbie movie.
","With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth. Very curious to know the film's future: if it will be forgetfull or timeless as Barbie, the doll, has been.",6
" There is an art-house movie under all that pink
","I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first. Well, I am glad I kept an open mind.<br><br>This is a riotously funny, zany meta comedy with touches of Wes Anderson and Bollywood; yet also strangely affecting. The idea of giving a plastic doll an existential crisis may seem gimmicky, yet it works. The cracks showing in the perfect façade of the perfect Barbie world are rendered through metaphors that hit the mark, full of a strange melancholia. I am usually put off by sentimentalisms: here, thankfully, they are kept at a bare minimum, even in the ending.<br><br>Overall, I am astonished this film exists at all. I imagine the authors meeting with a slightly distracted Mattel executive, being given a gazillion of dollars with the vaguest of briefs, and running away with it, to make a film that would send any corporate committee into a tailspin -- I imagine a first projection with the producers fainting and having a heart attack -- yet also make them laugh all the way to the bank. However it happened, chapeau. I am glad I went, I'll buy the dvd as well. I can see myself rewatching it to be sure I got all the micro gags and layers of meaning, but also putting it on when I need a little pick me up.",9
" Somewhere there is a good story
","For starters this movie was made by women for women. I was not the intended audience, which is fine. But I feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here, or there could have been one. That everyone could have really liked.<br><br>The movie is well made; I could tell that the people who made the movie liked Barbie, and knew their stuff. And that bleed into the movie. It has a cool set, lot's of creative choices and has good actors. With some genuinely funny gags and jokes.<br><br>The cons: Some movies are great pieces of art, where you can't nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say. The classic disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan Pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themes.<br><br>Then there some films like Atlas Shrugged where you know exactly what it's trying to say from the get-go. This is one of the those films, except it doesn't just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another. This film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it up.<br><br>I don't think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be. And it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical. And all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way. There was even this car chase scene in middle which I believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for Chevrolet.<br><br>Also there were some very weird parts of the movie. Where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways. I'll just give one example and finish on that. At the end Barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have. But she is wrong, everything she listed weren't women problems they were people problems. That's life. I sorry but it's not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss. Go talk to Machiaveli. These are problems everyone has.<br><br>Anyway that's my review. I hope it's balanced and fair and gave you a good idea about what this film is .",6
" A much more emotional journey than I expected
","Leading up to the day I went to see this movie, I avoided as much advertising as I could as to avoid spoilers and go in entirely blind. But that being said, I learned very late that Greta Gerwig was the director of this film, and therefore, was not prepared for the emotional journey I was about to be taken through.<br><br>This movie was unique, creative, fun, and so special. The music was excellent, the cast was wonderful, the costumes were amazing, it was funny, and the choreography was fun.<br><br>As for it's flaws, this movie did have some uneven pacing. I felt that some side plot stuff was unnecessary (namely, most of the Mattel chase). Sometimes it was just very confusing for the sake of making audience members existential, the ending felt abrupt, and there was little justice by the end of the movie (though perhaps this was more of a conscious choice on behalf of the filmmakers to convey the endless, feminist fight).<br><br>I was happy to see how this film really explored the female experience. From growing up to objectification by men. I was shocked to see Ken claim to love Barbie, only to objectify and hurt her later on; it was truly reminiscent of many elements in real life. Overall the tone and look of this movie was very unique and I enjoyed it a lot.<br><br>I didn't expect to cry during the fun, silly Barbie movie I had been so excited to see, but I'm glad it was as emotional as it was.",8
" It is, indeed, a Barbie world
","Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.",7
" Barbenheimer! Decent comedy handled with a sledgehammer
","Saw this kind of late on 07/21 after Oppenheimer. As expected the movie looks great, Barbieland is a crazy set, shot well and all actors are committed.<br><br>Was a bit disappointed with Gosling but could just be the writing/direction for him. Margot Robbie and America Ferrara shine the most, and to a lesser extent Gosling, Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell (those last two are smaller side characters).<br><br>Some issues with pacing or maybe the movie should've shorter, and the music wasn't all that memorable surprisingly. I would've like more songs or better yet for this whole movie to be a musical!<br><br>My biggest gripe is the writing. It is painfully heavy handed, preachy and full of cringe. This is because the evil patriarchy and righteous feminism is ramped up to 100.<br><br>I honestly kept checking my watch, was looking at uber's home with like 30-40min left, and struggling so hard not to walk out (i never do, always stay to the end no matter what!) or fall asleep. Maybe it was partly because I had just gotten out of the 3hr Oppenheimer (which I had a strong coffee during) but this was one of the toughest movies I had to sit through in a theater in a very long time.<br><br>I think most, but still probably not all, women will enjoy it, but for the fellas? Unless you're a self described male feminist or far-left politically, or maybe just a simp, your mileage is really going to vary and this may not be for you.<br><br>I like Greta Gerwig and the cast but this was a big miss and let down for me. Messaging aside, I struggle to give this higher than a 5, maybe a 6 at the absolute best, wouldn't give it lower than a 3. So I'm going with 4/10.",4
" Barbie is everything & bring on Kenergy
","I don't think I've been this excited about a movie in a long while.<br><br>It was somewhat different than what I was expecting, but in some fantastic ways. Margot Robbie was a fantastic choice as Barbie. She shines, she makes you fall in LOVE with Barbie again, effervescent in every moment, she fully enveloped how a lot of us remember playing with Barbie, and what we thought and hoped for when we grew up.<br><br>America Ferrera - fantastic. She brought me to tears
Ryan Gosling was a scene stealer! His Kenergy was phenomenal - in a movie where he was literally ""and Ken""
Greta Gerwig truly brought the entire Barbieland to life.<br><br>I laughed, I cried , I ugly cried and I'm still revisiting every moment.",10
" Well made movie but a little uneven
","Barbie was a fun movie and it visually looked really original. There were some really funny parts and some good acting. I loved some of the throwbacks and songs. Really was laughing at some of the funny moments.<br><br>The story and pacing was a little off and uneven for me. Couple of the characters felt a little flat to me, but overall it was a well made movie. Some of the songs were really great and the camera work was really good as well. I wish the story felt a little more connected overall. The tone really shifted around a bunch of times and it got a bit distracting. A movie can be funny and serious.. but it just didn't seem to know what tone it wanted to be and was a bit conflicting to me. Overall still enjoyed myself.",6

The first 30 minutes were slow, the middle frenetic, and the last boring.<br><br>It seemed like it just drags and I still doesn't seem to have a cohesive message and some of the characters really had no contribution or purpose. I was sorely disappointed. Over-hyped, and unsurprising my wife even fell asleep.... My teens left without a sense of what the story was. It was jumbled and I feel reviewers are praising it for the sake of praising a female empowering movie but those have been done much better before and without being tacky.",4
" Barbie is life
","I watched this movie expecting something else, but after the movie was finished I was not expecting so much humor, emotional rollercoasters, and a lot of Barbies with Kens. The last scene where Barbie wants to be a human had me almost in tears. I felt different in the heart as well. The soundtrack was also amazing as well. I just wish that there could be more Barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales. If not ""Blame Mattel"" lol. The Mattel jokes had me laughing every time they were brought up. I couldn't have asked for a better comedy movie for the summer.",10
" Gosling helps lift the movie but Mixed
","Just saw 'Barbie' today directed by Greta Gerwig. It is a bit difficult to rate. Slow to start - a tedious first 30 or 40 mins. Didn't like the lift from 2001 either. But the latter half with Gosling somewhat makes up for the beginning. His musical number was fantastic.<br><br>Aspects of it reminded me of Pleasantville, PeeWee Herman's Big Adventure, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and even a bit from the Matrix - some interesting associations.<br><br>Overall kinda liked the movie but can only give it a fair rating. The Mattel chasing subplot was superfluous and detracting coupled with the slow start needing rework. Could have used better conflict focus and editing on the story I think. Needed to cut some of the vague ideas or loose ends and focus on theme of interpretation and melding of materialism/paternalism. Overall Mixed.",6
" Beautiful
","This movie made me laugh, and cry. It was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls, while still poking fun at it all. It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect. It was beautiful and I'd watch again.",10
" One of a kind
","I am amazed at the enormous success of this film. I'm not implying that it is a bad movie, but it's just a fun film based on dolls. It certainly is different and kind of unique with a pretty wonderful opening along with a fascinating production design, but ya gotta love pink! It's all about feminism and patriarchy and it's a little heavy handed about both of those topics, but it makes its points. While it's not a great film, it took some great talent to make this odd idea work and I am referring specifically to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach who provide some funny and witty moments. In my opinion, both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both too old for their roles, but they pull it off quite well. While it looks and feels like a children's film some of the time since this is about dolls, it's message is for adults, though children would appreciate a lot of it without really getting it, so to speak. It also has some really good choreography and a very nice song by Billie Eilish who I am kind of surprised doesn't appear in this at some point, though Will Ferrell does, which is a shame as he is his usual annoying self, but that's just me. I've never understood his appeal.",7

","Barbie is living a perfect life in her Barbie world filled with Barbies and Kens. Without the fear of change and the assurance of perfection, Barbie gets through the day partying until she starts thinking about death. Fearing malfunction, she is asked to visit the Real World to find her human pal to resolve the issue and get back to her perfect life. Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.<br><br>Initially, it takes a bit of time to get used to the narrative as well as the humor. Good thing is it doesn't take much time to get me invested in the world of Barbie and Ken. The perfect casting ensured the smooth flow of the story and the likes of Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell took care of elevating a simple scene with their impeccable comic timing. It is the final act, where Greta Gerwig proved why she is among the best to handle mother-daughter relationship or to even narrate women.<br><br>There are several scenes that earns instant laughter and those scenes are cleverly handled. I did expect atleast a couple of more dance numbers. Ryan Gosling easily became pick of the lot and Margot Robbie owned her character as Barbie. The monologue scene with the mother worked for me and ofcourse the Ken's breakdown towards the end. If the first hour provides genuine humor, it is the second half that truly make it a thorough entertainer blending humor with emotions.",7
" Fun but too heavy handed
","The movie is entertaining, most often when it just embraces the absurdity of the doll world. However, the feminist messaging is so heavy handed it feels like parody most of the time. Ken discovering the patriarchy was amusing but the joke goes too far, and again the only way I can describe it is that the message feels like a parody of itself, but you can tell that it's meant to be taken seriously.<br><br>I still think the movie is fun and genuinely amusing in places. But the most I enjoyed it was when we were with the Kens which I feel is a misfire in Barbie's movie.<br><br>I almost wish they had just made a comedic film, set mostly in Barbieland, and left the human characters out.<br><br>I admire what they tried to do, but the tones of the silly Barbie movie and the critique of society segments didn't mesh well.",4

Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud. I would highly recommend that everyone watch this film, it's quite the experience.",10
" Barbie Impresses in an Interesting Way
","Barbie, while not something I would typically watch, caught my interest. I watched the trailer and felt as though this would not be a typical kids movie. The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.<br><br>I will say that the humor is catered to parents in some aspects. The kids also have humor that they will enjoy. This movie is mainly for preteen/teenagers. Some parents of kids that are 10 years of age or younger may find the movie offensive.<br><br>Overall, solid movie with a great cast and a good script. No doubt a movie that was need for this summer's box office.",6
" ""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes and touches some important questions, however Barbie doll was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy
","Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig. And the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?"" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.<br><br>In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Truman Show""; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. ""Barbie"" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.<br><br>But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms ""Barbie"" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast ""Real Time"" in which he said: ""Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment"". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.<br><br>The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idiots, greedy, dumb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the ""Stereotyped"" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).<br><br>The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory ""diversity and inclusion"" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be ""empowering"" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.<br><br>Ken represents the ""evil patriarchy"". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the ""toxic"" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.<br><br>All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile ""conservative fascist"". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the ""evil businessmen"" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are ""dumb"". The Barbies' plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).<br><br>""Barbie"" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.<br><br>""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, ""Barbie"" doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. ""Who is Barbie?"": the only possible conclusion is that it is a toy that has ensured at least two more decades of popularity.",5
" An Elf-like work of art.
","My husband asked me to compare this to something else to ally, and my first thought was Elf. In these ways it lives up to one of the greatest movies of all time - both are hilarious, have wonderful musical numbers, heartwarming, will make you tear up, complicated parental storylines, unlikely character bonding, and whimsical visual tie-ins/world-building + bonus of both having Will Ferrel to boot.<br><br>I loved the soundtrack - the Lizzo song being a fun 4th wallesque/narrator-y way to introduce Barbieland.<br><br>The pace was even - I never felt it was moving too quickly or wanting a scene to wrap up.<br><br>Some more unexpected show-stealers were Simu Liu and Arianna Greenblatt.<br><br>The haters are simply mad this is a film that is self-aware and for a new generation.",10
" Its just Barbie and Ken
","There's so much to say about the movie, so many points to touch on that I don't know how to express it correctly.<br><br>Let me start by discussing a few parts that I really liked. First of all, Ryan Gosling's performance was amazing; it overshadowed everything in the film. A masterful and remarkable performance. While not Margot Robbie's best performance, she did quite well too. I didn't find the other actors or actresses quite as impressive.<br><br>Another aspect I found impressive was the costumes; in my opinion, the film definitely deserved an Oscar for them. They were the best costumes I've seen in a long time. Similarly, the color coordination was superb.<br><br>I also enjoyed the production; most things were cohesive from a technical standpoint. The comedy in the film was of good quality, and there were scenes that I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun watching.<br><br>Now, moving on to the things I didn't like, and the area I'd like to emphasize the most - the screenplay. After watching a strong first half, I became very invested in the movie, but the ending suffocated me. Trying to convey so many messages felt utterly pointless. The film had already managed to balance comedy and drama in the first half; there was no need to forcefully shove these messages down our throats in such a contrived manner. I understood the message, but I ended up leaving the theater feeling frustrated.<br><br>In addition, there's a part I absolutely disliked: Barbie's convincing Kens with their beauty and then reclaiming Barbie Land. It felt too simplistic and contradicted the main point of the movie. It definitely could have been written more cleverly. Moreover, the metaphorical scene of Classic Barbie talking to the creator (metaphorically) and visiting a gynecologist was harsh and not smartly executed. It was emotional, yes, but personally, it felt heavy.<br><br>In short, summing up the technical aspects and acting, the film scored a 6.5 to 7 from me. However, the disjointedness of the screenplay and its excessive urge to convey messages left me extremely disappointed. Women are our treasures; we should stand firm against discrimination and support each other. Let's love one another, let's love our women - they are our mothers. They are all invaluable, and so are we. Hopefully, one day everyone will be equal, just like Barbie's aim, and you can achieve your goals just like Ken does.<br><br>Note: Regardless of everything, people should stop comparing Barbie and Oppenheimer ; Barbie ran a crazy advertising campaign, and it's necessary to admit that their popularity and the pink frenzy are owed to their advertising efforts.",7
" Better than expected
",Being a huge barbie fan I had to go watch this movie and let me tell you it did not disappoint. Started as a fun kids movie but took a. Wry interesting turn with its story line.<br><br>The display of patriarchy in real world using barbie land was so smartly done.<br><br>A great direction with attention to details that makes this so much fun to watch.<br><br>Some of the moments will make you burst out laughing and some will make you really emotional.<br><br>It's a movie for every age group but absolutely a must watch for teenagers.<br><br>My fiancé watched it with me who doesn't know anything about barbies but has a wonderful time. He rated it 8/10 so that's quite a lot.<br><br>Enjoy.,10
" Very mixed
","The start was a wonderfully fun look at Barbies &amp; Kens in Barbieland but I felt that it was a bit abrupt when Barbie out of nowhere had thoughts of death would've made more sense for her to notice signs of imperfection first then thoughts of death.<br><br>Film doesn't hate men I actually really enjoyed how they handled Ken by showing how it is so easy for society to corrupt young teen men with people like Andrew Tate etc. Although ending was bad, why not have Kens and Barbies in charge together as going in the real world showed that men running it was bad &amp; Barbieland was only a utopian for the Barbies. At one point Barbie is asked where do the Kens sleep and she thinks for a moment before saying ""I don't know"" then that's it we never learn, basically her saying ""I don't know and I don't care."" They did so well showing Ken's feelings of being inadequate, inferior and almost like a toy for Barbie to play with when she wanted and yet they just end with the Barbies taking back control of Barbieland, they give Ken's low level government jobs because they should struggle like woman. So, the message is it's okay for one gender to have to fight, claw and struggle for anything good as long as it's men?<br><br>Also this is entire my own preference and has no fault of story but most of the cast was a bit rubbish for me anyway. It was as if the casting director watched some British shows and picked actors from, like did we really need 3 sex education actors all of which were pretty bland?",6
" A Great Comedy & Satire
","Opens with a great tribute to 2001: a Space Odyssey's ape sequence, setting the scene for the humour and satire to follow. Barbie and Ken escape from Barbieland into the real world, threatening societal breakdown in both as changes in one universe affects the other. Barbieland is effectively a Matriarchy where girls rule and the Kens just do Beach, play sports, stand around and try to attract the attention of the Barbies. There are all types of Barbies, President Barbie, the Supreme Court Barbie, Roadworker Barbies. Margot Robbie is Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling as her Beach Ken. They travel to the real world after Barbie starts developing cellulite and worrying about death. Ken learns about patriarchy in the real world, especially from the clever corporate types who affect an image of equality but use this as a cover to carry on in the old manner. Ken returns to Barbieland intent on turning it into a Kendom and turning the world upside down. Barbie faces the all male Executive board of Mattel where the CEO (Ken Ferrell) defends his policies but literally tries to put Batbie in a box. . Cutting satire, great humour in a whipsmart script with wonderful fake pastel sets in Barbieland. The themes and set decoration bring Don't Worry Darling and Asteroid City to mind. Kate McKinnon is Weird Barbie who helps Stereotypical Barbie to solve her personal problems and to battle against the Kendom. I'll have to see this again. I reckon to properly appreciate all the jokes, irony and satire. Greta Gerwig takes no prisoners as she Directs and Co-Writes (with Noah Baumbach) this comic masterpiece. 9/10.",9
" Barbie: Not For Me, But It's Fine For What It Is
","This probably wouldn't come off as a shocker to anyone who knows me, but I'm definitely not the target audience for this film. That doesn't mean I dislike the film in anyway, just thought that would be an important thing to point out before actually reviewing this film.<br><br>Surprisingly the movie wasn't generic or filled with over-the-top cliches, and judging from the trailer, I thought I'd have seen this story play out so many times before. I mainly expected it to depend on its humor, which is probably the only thing that lived up to my expectations because I'm a way it kind of did. It actually had a compelling message that had decent pacing to lead up to that message (obviously the message wasn't directed towards me in any way, but to young girls who struggle with these issues, that's not to say the message is bad or anything, I just can't say much about a message that's not even directed towards me).<br><br>Without Ryan Gosling, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this film as much as I did. I'm definitely not saying the other actors were completely horrible in there role, because it's quite the opposite, I just don't think it would've lived up to Gosling's performance to me. I like Margot Robbie as an actress, and I think she does a great job for this role. And for the most part a lot of the actors here were great too of course.<br><br>If I had to come up with one negative for this film, maybe the gender roles thing was a little preachy, but honestly it doesn't bother me nearly as much as most films handle this subject. I've seen how completely woke certain films can be, and it's not nearly as bad as the way this film handles it so I can't really be too upset about it. Other than that, this is a film you can't really take seriously because it's a comedy. All I can say is this movie was fine, but definitely not for me, and that's ok.",7
" I just wanted a to see a fun Barbie movie, not feel depressed
","How did I go to watch Barbie, only to have seen a mildly depressing unecessarily deep movie saturated with politics and talk of mental health. The plot made no sense.<br><br>For someone who has grown up and loved watching all the classics, it was a disappointment. Most women like to watch feel-good chick flicks as an escape from reality, and for the same reason, girls like to watch Barbie. But it was nothing like that, and instead I left the cinema feeling LITERALLY depressed. As a little girl, not a single part of me thought the old Barbie movies presented a Barbie who wasn't a strong figure. And yes, you can be strong, WHILE being in love.<br><br>The way the movie was filmed was truly a work of art, but the plot made NO sense despite them trying to constantly spoon-feed it to us.<br><br>In Barbie land the women (the barbies) are in charge and have everything while the men (the Kens) are nobodies with absolutely no power and are treated like nobodies. They dont even have houses. When Barbie enters the real word, she realises its the complete reverse. You'd think that Barbie would then REALISE that how she was being treated is how the barbies were treating the kens, then go back to Barbie land and FIX it. Instead, when she goes back to see Ken turning Barbie-land into Ken-land (because the poor sod had a taste of what it feels like to be appreciated when he was in the real world), she has a crisis and then gathers the barbies to MANIPULATE the kens into FIGHTING each other so they can take back their power. Then instead of apologising to Ken (who was genuinely in love with her and had no TRUE bad intentions the entire movie - he thought the patriarchy was about horses) about how she constantly brushed him off like an annoying child every 5 seconds, she simply apologises for not spending some time with him, then continues to reject him and tells him he essentially needs to FIND himself. Then she wants to become human despite fighting to maintain her perfection throughout the movie, simply because someone told her its ok to be imperfect - and I get what they're trying to achieve here but I thought there would be a deeper reason? Perhaps there are things about being an imperfect human that are valuable? Such as having empathy, or maybe make it obvious that she was becoming a more realistic role model for little girls by becoming human with cellulite?<br><br>I get the intention of the movie, but it really didn't have to be that deep? I REALLY just wanted to have fun at a Barbie movie. The last thing you'd want to go watch after a long day at work or school is a movie about a silly fight between men and women, politics, patriarchy, death, depression and anxiety. The beginning of the film was fun, but that fun didn't last long. But people are probably gonna call us the brainwashed barbies because we actually want men to be our equals.",3
" BlackPink in your area
","Wow. Double and Triple Wow. Has there ever been a movie that a] was talky and intellectual that was the most popular movie in all the world? And b] Had no sex, no violence, no romance, no wisecracking flirty dialogs and was the most popular movie in all the world? I truly think there never has been. In the entire history of cinema. This movie is a shoo in for an academy award best picture. And is far, far, far more talky and intellectual than any prior best movie winner.<br><br>Sure. It isn't Simone de Beauvoir. Of course it couldn't possibly be. No one would go see it. But you can feel Greta Gerwig wanting to go there and restraining herself. And yes it slips into dumb middle brow nonsense on more than one occasion, simplifying an absurdly complicated set of issues. But not to the extent that pretty much every other Hollywood movie simplifies. There is meat here. Intelligence. Not to mention tremendous performances. And fantastic set design and a totally gonzo over the top plot. And it is fun. Wild wonderful fun.<br><br>You know, if you want to influence the world you first have to be popular. Like Blackpink and their powerful girl power message sent out to their tens of millions of tween followers. This long meditation on sexual politics and feminism is the god damn most popular movie in all the world. I am in total and complete awe.",9
" Could it ever meet expectations?
","Barbie Movie Review
She's a Barbie girl (who is having an existential crisis) in the Barbie world. Life isn't so fantastic. So she decides to head to the 'real world' with Ken because we've got everything sorted over here right?<br><br>The film highlights the paradox that is Barbie... and owns it. It would seem that they wrote a pros and cons list and tackled every item on it. Was Barbie an astronaut before women were allowed credit cards? Yes. Has she perpetuated unachievable body image stereotypes? Yes. Do they address both of these issues and everything in between - 100%. Even Mattel, the makers of Barbie and this film, aren't safe, poking fun at their own lack of diversity hiring.<br><br>The experience feels very intimate, getting up close with Margot Robbie. From the literal extreme close ups to the emotion she manages to give when bringing a kids toy to life. Robbie commits to the role but never comes across as ditzy or dumb, growing more with every scene.<br><br>However Ryan Gosling doesn't shift out of cheeseball mode but clearly relishes the chance to ham it up as a Himbo.<br><br>The narration from Helen Mirren, although brief, is one of the highlights. Punctuating moments with her dry British wit.<br><br>The message of inequality is prevalent in every line of this film and although it's an extremely important message, it could have been done without bashing you over the head with it for 2 hours.<br><br>Mums and Dads will love the nostalgia and the occasional double entendre. Girls and boys will have fun while hopefully absorbing her (not so subtle) message.<br><br>By Nick

" Kentastic!
","I honestly thought I have to see what the hype was all about but I'd go when the buzz has dies down but after not being able to get the ""I'm just Ken"" song out of my head for a couple of weeks I gave in and I'm glad I did...I really enjoyed it! This movie isn't just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough. Ryan stole the performance for me as Ken I looked more forward to his scenes then anything else. He captured so much in his looks and expressions that he totally steals the show and barbie actually felt secondary to me which is ironic as Ken always felt second. It could have been named Ken actually I loved knowing more about him then Barbie. Margot Robbie was beautiful and definitely captured Barbie she is stunning. Will Farrel plays the same character I feel though I love him but anyone could have played his role as boss of Mattel. I would watch it again for sure and I would actually love it if ""I'm just Ken"" wins best song at the Oscars and Ryan gets to sing it. Overall I can't find much wrong with it my only complaint is the real world I found a little bit boring I much preferred the dreamworld. Also the Alan character was great I wish we saw more of him. I definitely highly recommend this movie it's an enjoyable watch and a great pick me up smile on face movie.",8
" The core message was to support each other
","I thought Barbie was an ok movie, especially by recent standards. It was a whimsical, borderline funny movie that presented both femininity and masculinity in both toxic and healthy versions. Part of the movie that isn't brought up much is that during the first few minutes, Barbie World, which is completely matriarchal, is shallow and plastic. Life in Barbie World is boring. Which is why after Ken brings the patriarchy from the real world almost everyone is on board. It's different and fun. Then when Barbie returns, Barbie and a couple of others use deception and manipulation to win back power. Just like some aspects (some, not all) of the patriarchy, deception and manipulation are evil too. Then after Barbie finally sees Ken's dilemma, instead of only focusing on herself, she supports him. It's Barbie and its Ken. The message of the movie is not down with the patriarchy, nor is it anti matriarchy. The message of the movie is life is hard, with ups and downs and then you die, so we should support each other. Just like how some women see sexism everywhere or how some nonwhites see racism everywhere; I think the prevalence of anti-male propaganda in modern ""entertainment"" has led some people to see male bashing everywhere. I think this movie was balanced in its fault finding and the core message was to support each other.",7
" One of the Best Comedies of the Year
","I went to see Barbie in theaters today, and it is one of the best comedies of this year.<br><br>The story is really good, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did awesome as Barbie and Ken, respectively, the production design is amazing, Greta Gerwig's direction was pretty good, and the soundtrack was great. Billie Eilish's song ""What Was I Made For"" was also so good.<br><br>Barbie is one of the best movies of 2023, and my fifth favorite movie of 2023 so far. I recommend going to see it in theaters. Even anyone who isn't a fan of the Barbie dolls will enjoy this movie. This is also the 2007 live-action Bratz movie done right.",10
" Watch it with a critical eye, or just have fun. Both work!
","In my view there's two ways to watch / interpret Barbie. First, watch it with a critical eye about how Mattel have realised that they have to move with the times and to sell more dolls they need to 'normalise' Barbie. Second, just have fun. Both work. It is genius quite frankly. Mattel have taken criticism on the chin but ultimately know that they'll be quids in with a new 'flat footed' Barbie.<br><br>You should watch it and work out where you stand. To refuse to watch it because it's ""about a doll"" is missing the point in my view. It's a great movie to just watch and have fun with but equally you could watch it with a critical eye and work out where you stand.",7

" Falls short of greatness
","Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.",6

Very boring movie from the beginning till the end.<br><br>Throughout the whole movie, I just wanted the movie to be already over. That's how bored i was and how much it wss not interesting. I really got bored during the movie. There was really nothing fun or exciting. So yeah it was pretty disappointing.",4
" a love letter to women, girlhood and growing up outside of a world run by the patriarchy
","To me, Barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men. I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.<br><br>Men aside, i do think it healed something in me, however cliché it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it (would definitely show it to my future daughter, if i planned to have one). I think it's an incredible celebration of femininity and i think women deserve to enjoy every second of it without having to worry about anything or anyone else &lt;3.",10
" Probable Cult Classic
","Barbie is such a unique movie, it will probably become a very popular movie, at least a cult movie. Great songs ... it was a musical at times ... great talents. The jokes were embedded everywhere in the movie, the phrases, the T-shirts, the signs. I will have to watch the movie again to pickup on more of them.<br><br>The movie starts with the individual issues with Barbie, and Ken, and then Ken's feelings for Barbie, and the lack of feelings that Barbie has for Ken.<br><br>They are dolls, so some of the premise of the movie is really inconsistent ... and so many people, including myself, are trying to latch on aspects of the movie that they want to champion. Folks are now getting serious about the movie and its messages. Those folks must be too young to have gone through the '70s.<br><br>I am not a movie fanatic, so I am not aware of the possible meanings that the writers/directors had.<br><br>IMO, this is a gynocentric film, but it is supposed to be a spoof. The Barbie environment was created in a time of typical male/women roles, but exploited to an extreme. Barbie was always slim, white, and had some room for possible growth. Ken was a complete air-brain, only to accompany Barbie, possibly so she wouldn't look like a promiscuous woman.<br><br>My daughter had no desire to play with dolls, especially Barbies, nor did I want her to; she had her favorite doll (not a Barbie), but it was more of a companion, she was not its mother. My son did not play with toy soldiers, he had no interest in them, nor did I want him to, nor playing with toy guns (probably not for the typical reasons). When he got older, it was limited to lasertag, with a clear distinction from reality.<br><br>The movie skips around with Ken's understanding of his lack of value, Barbie's lack of affection for him; Barbie and Ken then learn about the ""real"" world. Barbie, of course, is devastated when she finds that real women don't have the same life as in BarbieLand, where women control the world. In ""real"" life, they don't do anything, they have no influence/power, important jobs (which can include just about anything), and are completely and utterly controlled by men. Right. That is realistic. The Kens find a completely different life as well, they actually can act like idiots.<br><br>The Kens then go off on some idiotic campaign to overthrow the Barbies ... stupid, but funny. Great musical numbers. The Kens have been ignored for years, the Barbies objectified. This is when the film goes off on a gynocentric bent, only concentrating on the oppression that Barbies have had. Forget the Kens.<br><br>The film apparently wants to get more philosophical/genuine at the end. This is ridiculous. There are booths at the theatre where photos can be taken, merchandise purchased, etc. This is nothing more than a money-making opportunity, keeping the same ideas. So now girls should be supporting this theme? Getting pictures taken with Barbie, wearing the pastel pink clothing that has been proven medically as causing epilepsy (a joke) ? I am not sure what new information the movie has for folks ... if any. Reading comments, some folks are actually considering the movie to exposing the problems of today. I hope society has progressed a bit further than the original Barbie concept, for both the Barbies and the Kens.<br><br>This movie will become a cult classic.",6
" This movie was so mediocre I had to write a review...
","This is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever. The plot is forgettable and a-lot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes. Barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate. The ken's were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them. Also the barbie's had no objection to the ken's instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought. They were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side character's superficial problems to bring them to their senses. These issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly. The movie has some plus points, being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8* ratings. An excruciatingly mind numbing movie with some moments of laughter, wait for this one to release on DVD or streaming platforms.",5
" This is more than just a 'lighthearted comedy'
","Barbie is no longer just a toy; rather, this idea of 'Barbie' has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time. It is so much more than merely a toy. It will not longer be just 'a toy'<br><br>I must admit, as i waited in the theatre for the movie to start showing, i had my doubts. So many things scanned through my head: one was that this movie will just be a lighthearted comedy; another was that the marketing for this movie is way too extravagant for a 'comedy'; and one of the biggest was that i would lose interest in this movie soon because i tend to lose track of comedies as it is really difficult for comedy films to impress me. Boy, was I wrong.<br><br>Where do I start:<br><br>To start off with, this is NOT just a comedy movie. Would everyone in the theatre have been in tears by the time the movie ended if it had been a simple comedy?<br><br>This movie is appealing to spectators of varying ages because of its heartwarming plot, a plot that touches everyone's heart, a topic that is heavy in nature but simple in the showcasing of this topic throughout the movie.<br><br>Barbie focuses on the story of Stereotypical Barbie &amp; Ken... Barbie starts to experience strange thoughts and strange symptoms which causes her to travel to the real world with Ken to find the child who is playing with her doll and to fix the issue. When reading this plot, it is easy to imagine that this is just a comedy, action, simple film etc. However, this is only the PLOT... the storyline is very different.<br><br>The opening scene itself focuses on a rather heavy topic of childhood, stereotypes, a new generation etc. With Barbie (Margot Robbie) appearing and the one of the little girls smashing her dolls to pieces, this was a very symbolic gesture to add right at the beginning of the film. It is is symbolic in the sense that, the young girl smashing her dolls represents a new generation in which dolls are not played with, it may also represent girls smashing or declining 'their dreams' due to female stereotypes (a topic that is heavy in this film) - I liked that Gerwig made it clear in the first 10 seconds of the movie that this film is not one to be taken lightly.<br><br>Good comedic scenes are present throughout the film. Such as the jokes about Alan... however, even though Alan being on his own and not many people caring about Alan are seen as 'comedy' - I feel that there is much more behind Alan, and that making his scenes comedic are just a barrier, and that Gerwig wants spectators to take apart these scenes and to analyse what is behind that wall. That being Alan may represent 'women' in the sense that in this male-dominant world, women are constantly feeling pressured and alone, and not listened to.<br><br>I like how Gerwig didn't make a whole 'new' concept of Barbie... this added to the topic of childhood and simplicity. I particularly liked how when Barbie floats from the top of her dream house to her car, this was symbolic as when young children play with Barbies, that is how they get their Barbie doll down too, they bring the barbie down as if it is floating, I really liked this detail, had innocence to it.<br><br>Further on in the movie, the topics start to get heavier: For example when Barbie meets Sasha. Sasha described first world problems such as feminism, here Gerwig had SUDDENLY brought in these topics, without warning. Again, I liked this because it shows how suddenly this world makes decisions regarding women's rights, and how quick this world is to judge women.<br><br>Ken's storyline was also an intricate part of the movie, the 2nd half of the movie is solely based on Ken wanting to not just be Ken and Barbie, but wanting to feel important. In the end, Ken realises that he is important too. Gerwig does this really well.... Although this movie highlights topics relating to women's rights, the end juxtaposes that in a sense and just shows that everyone is equal, and that was a nice message to finish the film off.<br><br>The ending montage of childhood, barbies, children etc was a really heart-wrenching moment, a great way to end the movie... Gerwig played with emotions here, spectators started off the movie laughing, and ended in crying. Great way to showcase opposing topics.<br><br>All in all, fantastic movie.",9
" ""BARBIE"" REVIEW
","Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig. A runtime of one hour and fifty-four minutes. With a PG-13 rating.<br><br>Narrated throughout by Helen Mirren. Starring Margot Robbie playing the world-famous Mattel toy company character ""Barbie"", specifically ""Stereotypical Barbie"". Also starring her playmate/partner and fellow toy ""Ken"", specifically ""Beach Ken"" played by Ryan Gosling.<br><br>Life in ""Barbie Land"" is magnificent. Every morning is spectacular. With ""President Barbie"" played by Issa Rae, ""Doctor Barbie played by Alexandra Shipp, and ""Physicist Barbie"" played by Margot Robbie doppelgänger Emma Mackey to name a few.<br><br>With many different ""Kens"" played by John Cena, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir who's playing ""Bob Marley in next year's biopic, and Ncuti Gatwa to name a few. Oh, and you can't forget about ""Allan"" played by Michael Cera.<br><br>Every day is magical until it's not. After ""Stereotypical Barbie"" started getting some weird thoughts. She is advised by ""Weird Barbie"" played by SNL Alum Kate McKinnon to go to the real world and find her human.<br><br>Not wanting to leave her side ""Beach Ken"" hitches along for the ride. But once in the real world, they will learn new harsh realities. Between ""Stereotypical Barbie"" now adult human ""Gloria"" played by America Ferrera and her teenage daughter ""Sasha"" played by Ariana Greenblatt things are far from how life is in ""Barbie Land"".<br><br>With ""Beach Ken"" as well getting a heavy dose of reality. These new revelations jeopardize life in ""Barbie Land"" as a whole. It will take everyone including ""Mattel Ceo"" played by Will Ferrell to fix everything that's been forever altered.<br><br>""Barbie"" from the start was said to be different. Co-Writer and director Greta Gerwig said this wasn't going to be a typical ""Barbie"" film and that the viewer will be surprised. She couldn't be more right.<br><br>This film appealed to little girls and women as a whole. It was deep. It touched on emotions and feelings all women feel, have felt, or will feel at some point in their life. Many women cried while watching the film because of how hard some of the points in the film hit.<br><br>It wasn't all serious. It also wasn't all pink and rainbows too. It had jokes that everyone could laugh at while also having jokes that only the older viewer would get. It made sure to not take itself too seriously but also have points to make you think. I laughed throughout the film. It was really funny.<br><br>The ""Kens"" were hilarious morons. Both ""Ken"" and ""Barbie"" made fun of themselves it also had points in it that were referring to some of the stuff going on in today's climate.<br><br>It was fantastically done with a lot of satire. Even the overly silly stuff made a way to make it somewhat funny. Don't judge this book by the cover you will be highly surprised. So many great actors throughout that added to the film. Ryan Gosling knew the assignment.<br><br>All ages, genders, and nongenders will enjoy this film. With obvious points paying homage to women. A fun film I enjoyed way more than I thought I would. Expect a lot of different emotions with some hard-hitting realities as well. Once again I have to give a shout-out to the director/co-writer for hitting the mark. Because that's a big task to ask.<br><br>This was an excellent film weekend with
""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"". With their respective writer/director doing an amazing job doing both. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but I expect most women to rate this five mor fires. Which makes perfect sense.<br><br>#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

" Best movie ever!
","This might just be the best movie I've ever seen. The more I think about it, the more I realize just how genius it is! I mean they really thought out every little detail!<br><br>My favorite part is that: if you love this movie, you get the movie. And if you hate the movie, you also get the movie. It truly is a movie for people who love it and hate it. It's for everyone.<br><br>I'd like to talk about the genius of this plot for a moment. We start off in a matriarchal society. However, it's a society created by little girls, so the Barbies are not violent towards the Kens. They just aren't obsessed with the Kens. The Kens are just in the background, this is representative of how children girls feel. Then, we go into the real world and we are introduced to a patriarchal society. But not just any patriarchal society. It's a society created by adults. So we see toxic masculinity and we see violent tendencies. Then, we go back to Barbieland and Ken brings all of his knowledge of the patriarchy with him. He creates a toxic meninist movement, which emphasizes the point that extremism is not the answer. We cannot overcorrect a mistake or it will cause more mistakes. The Kens start to become violent, even towards each other. This is a good representation of what women deal with in the real world. We can't even rely on each other sometimes. Women can be hateful towards each other as well. Finally, the movie comes to a close with Barbie taking a small step in the right direction. She says it doesn't have to be ""Barbie and Ken"", ""it's Barbie and it's Ken"". Now here's we're people start to get pissed. Barbie just got done saying that the Barbie's and Ken's need to start living as equals, but when when of the Kens asks to be on the Supreme Court the President Barbie says no that's too far, let's start with maybe a cabinet member or something.... Wow how could they... just kidding. You're SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY about this! This is an accurate representation of the real world! The movie literally ends with the Barbie world being an exact replica of the real world, only with the gender roles reversed.<br><br>Another thing I'd like to point out is that even Ken says at the end that he didn't really like patriarchy anyway. He just wanted to ride horses. Again, this is because he is a doll in a world created by children. I think there's a lot to unpack here but my overall take was that the world is a better place from the POV of a child and adults are the ones who are ruining everything. Even Mattel is kind of shown as a ""bad guy"" in the movie, but even they say, they didn't make Barbie for her to become a sexualized standard. They made Barbie to allow girls to dream of more than just being a mother. With Barbie they can be anything they want to be. It wasn't until adults came along and taught us to sexualize Barbie, that we started to hold her to a different standard.<br><br>I think most people watch this movie and see the beauty and the genius of it. I think a few hateful people will watch this movie with their tainted glasses and their preconceived biases and they will get very close to understanding it. Every person I've see criticizing this movie, I'm like you're SO CLOSE to the point. You're basically running head first into it. That is the most frustrating and the most gratifying thing about this movie. It's a trap. You can't say hateful things about it, without PROVING THE POINT OF THE MOVIE!",10
" Pleasantly surprised, but maybe it's a bit too much
","I went to see this movie without even seeing the trailer first. I'm a 42 yo man and people kept posting stuff about this movie on social media, so when a friend asked me to go watch it, I said yes...<br><br>I was expecting some kind of dumb movie, but this is not. It appeals to teenagers but also to an older audience. I loved the sense of humor, Mattel was sometimes laughing at themselves too. I found that very nicely done. The acting is amazing. However I liked the first part of the movie more than the second one. It starts to analyze the patriarchy a bit too heavily for my taste. They want to make it clear that this is a feminist movie. They want to clear Barbie's image of the stereotypes she's been associated with for decades: she's not a blonde and skinny perfect bimbo girl. Barbie is a feminist, she represents empowered women. I keep questioning myself about this point of view: little girls have been associating the idea of beauty with Barbie for so long, so my idea of Barbie has been quite the opposite throughout my life. I find it hard to accept it.<br><br>Now let's talk about Ken. He only exists because Barbie exists. In Barbie Land he counts nothing. There is a deep criticism toward the patriarchy which I can understand but goes slightly too far for my taste...",7
" Flabbergasting
","When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it.",10
" Entertaining bubblegum fluff piece lacks true subtlety
","Consistently entertaining, imaginative, and occasionally wickedly funny, Greta Gerwig helms an audaciously original take on the iconic doll, fashioning a pastel wonderland with deeper, albeit crudely pushed, morals and ideas. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll whose carefree existence in the utopian Barbieland is one day disrupted, leading her eventually into the real world, accompanied by the hapless Ken, played by Ryan Gosling in a valiant attempt to drag character from caricature.<br><br>Baumbach and Gerwig's script is loaded with references and nods to many aspects of pop culture, pulling them off pretty successfully with the aid of Gerwig's direction, which matches the tone of the script perfectly, at turns breathlessly light and then scathingly precise.<br><br>The production design team in particular clearly got much of the funding, with lush and detailed sets, picture-perfect outfits, and enough pink to cause a temporary world shortage of the colour. Robbie in particular does a fabulous job of capturing the subtleties of inner struggles behind a perfect facade, and it is on her character that the movie finds its feet and produces sparks of deeper emotion. Gosling, meanwhile, delivers some of the best comedic timing and lines of the movie, and does his best to convince us that the script did not severely underwrite his role, or in fact the roles of everyone save the idea of womanhood.<br><br>For a movie which purports to deliver a nuanced take on the influence of Barbie and the implications of its commercial success in a world admittedly mostly governed by men, parts of the script come off as overly preachy and about as subtle as the amount of pink in this movie. This does detract from the entertainment factor, especially with the mild stakes and average pacing, meaning that when you're looking at it, it's nice to look at, but you could easily not be looking at it either.<br><br>Many of the ideas introduced are thought-provoking and interesting in the context of the meaning of humanity, especially in the first two acts. In the third, much of those ideas get resolved far too easily, and on a couple occasions, in a manner which undercuts the message of equality it purports to show.<br><br>There are some standout moments, especially a ridiculously funny and entertaining sequence featuring Gosling's Ken towards the end, and one or two impactful, quiet moments where Robbie and Gerwig gel together perfectly, but in between them is a vacuous fantasy that rests somewhere comfortably between bubblegum fluff and feminist hit piece.<br><br>Another thing to note is the music, which is superb throughout, and matched mostly by Gerwig's direction and her staging of some great sequences.<br><br>Never a struggle to watch, shot through with occasionally successfully executed ideas, it leaves one with a good feeling, but nothing as lasting as it wishes it could be.",7
" ""The Matrix"" re imagined in pink and neon... it doesn't work
","I saw this film with an open mind. I was ready for it to be enjoyable in some sort of way, either visually, through the actors, perhaps a fun story, or just turning off the brain and seeing what they came up with. Unfortunately, it struck out on all accounts. The much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast. The actors were so clichéd and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch (as you may have heard, Ryan Gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name). The movie was not fun after the first 15 minutes. In fact, it was intentionally written to be painful and to express the writer/director's personal concerns. We were supposed to be frustrated but were not rewarded with any payoff at the end.<br><br>Most concerning is that Barbie was clearly modeled after the first Matrix movie but in all the worst ways. Barbie's world is a binary place composed of Barbieland, where the embodiments of the toys live and what they call ""The Real World"". The Real World is name of the place they travel to in Matrix as well but, in Barbie, it's not a dark hellish landscape run by machines. Instead, it resembles our actual real world in appearance but it seems to be run by the evil toy company Mattel. Also, the men are all shown to be domineering, rude, and chauvinistic. It's clearly supposed to represent our real world but goes so far into fantasy that it's as unrealistic as the one in The Matrix. A man walking by Barbie sexually harasses her and slaps her on the backside. She then gets arrested for defending herself (what??). While shes being arrested, the male officers comment on her body and sexually harass her more. The toy company executives all wear suits like the Agents in The Matrix and work in unrealistic barren, industrial looking cubicles. They also drive black SUVs around with no regard for law and order as though they are in charge of the world. We get many heavy handed speeches about how badly women are treated in The Real World and I lost count of the number of times the word ""patriarchy"" was used. I know the director wanted to express her thoughts about western society but it was such a dystopian, bleak world that it was impossible to compare it to our world. In The Matrix, there was depth and nuance to both worlds but in Barbie there was mostly sadness in both. The movie shows a fake world dominated by women in the beginning, then a fake world dominated by men as it progresses, and completes by showing us that the two are completely incompatible. The bright, colorful, happy movie we were shown in the promotional material is actually dark, depressing, and irredeemable. If it was meant to reflect our real world, well, it's so far out there that it doesn't even come close. If its mean to show a fantasy world, the fantasy is that there is incompatibility and depression between the sexes with no solution available. It was difficult to complete watching Barbie because it tried to say so much that, in the end, it said nothing at all. It was a fantasy film with only an unhappy, sad fantasy to show once all the pastel colors and fashionable outfits had faded.",2
" MEANINGFUL MOVIE.
","Very well made. Terrific directing, acting and writing. It gets deeper at times, but the best part of it is that it isn't trying to be heavy and ""meaningful"" the whole way through. It has a good balance of the more emotional moments with lighthearted humor.<br><br>Synopsis:

" It is ""Kenough"" for me!
","Barbie is one of the most iconic toys of all time! It genuinely baffled me that it took this long for there to be a Barbie film. Barbie isn't my thing, so I wasn't interested in watching this. It wasn't until the first trailer came out and the global internet cultural phenomenon ""Barbenheimer"", the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, that my interest was piqued. So is life plastic, it's fantastic? Or is it just Ken?<br><br>Firstly, casting Margot Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie was perfect! She is incredibly charming and earnest in the role. She conveys a naive yet caring nature to her character while being very funny at times. Ryan Gosling as Beach Ken is also perfect casting! He is the greatest highlight with his hilarious physical performance. Every time he is on screen, he brings the laughs. Ryan also conveys a vulnerability to Ken which is surprising. Margot and Ryan have a fun chemistry together! This film has a huge cast with many playing other variations of Barbie and Ken. They are all good in their limited screen time but the stand out is Michael Cera who plays Ken's best buddy Allan. I just love how different he is from the others and how he manages to be so lovable in his limited screen time.<br><br>From the first 30 minutes, you will notice the amazing costumes and set designs. Barbieland itself looks like a Barbie toy set brought to life. The massive amount of pink covering the world, the plastic look of all the accessories, houses and cars. Every Barbie and Kens clearly had a lot of thought put into their costumes because no Barbie and Ken look the same. Every costume manages to reflect the type of Barbie and Ken they are. The music score is great and the use of vocal songs was utilized effectively. Special mention to ""I'm Just Ken"" sung by Ryan Gosling! Some great dance scenes are entertaining to watch with their fun choreography. It is a comedy at heart and there are quite some funny jokes and moments with a surprising amount of great adult jokes. I also love how they poke fun at Mattel and even Barbie as a brand which is a bold move. Despite that, some strong emotional moments with one near the end can definitely tug at the heartstrings.<br><br>However, the movie does suffer from some poor execution of certain elements. There is the Barbieland stuff which is enjoyable but the real-world stuff is just not that fun. It is stated early on that Barbie's thoughts are being influenced by someone playing with Barbies in the real world. How does the connection work? How much of Barbie's thought is her own? None of these things are explored, leaving many questions. On that note, certain characters will change very quickly without much build-up to these changes. Due to this, we don't get a true understanding of Barbie as a character, she changes because the film needs some kind of character development. There is also a mother and daughter character in the real world who Barbie meets. One of them is depressed and there is a rift between them but the film doesn't bother to explore the reason for any of that. We also meet Will Ferrell who plays the CEO of Mattel and he is just inconsequential to the story but takes a lot of screen time. He is also over-the-top and silly.<br><br>I was hoping for a contrast between the cartoony Barbieland and the real world. However, characters in the real world act just as cartoony and ridiculous as those in Barbie Land. It makes the real-world scenes less impactful when it should have been a big moment in the film. The film is also incredibly preachy about its feminist message that it can be exhausting. Also, the 3rd act has a silly resolution that feels contradictory to the feminist nature of this film. Additionally, every male character in this film are idiotic baby and if that gets under your skin, then this movie is not for you.<br><br>Overall, Barbie is a good fun time. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. This film is not going to appeal to everyone with its themes and message. Nevertheless, the movie is just plain entertaining and honestly, it is ""Kenough"" for me!",7
" Silly and a waste of time
","The marketing team for this movie really need to take a bow because I honestly can't believe how this movie made so much money. It was like watching a really long toy commercial. The plot itself had some promise and there were some laughs but in general the movie was quite stupid.<br><br>To start with there we're not enough big laugh moments and most of the humour was quite slapstick and lame. Secondly there seemed to be no real payoffs or explaining of choices. The only character who seemed to act in a way that was rationale was Ken, but even at the end he just gave up there was no conclusion so to speak of.<br><br>The sets were quite fun and well thought out. But overall I was pretty bored and mostly waiting for the movie to be over. If you really want to watch this, wait for it to come out on the plane or on streaming platforms, don't bother spending your hard earned money on this garbage.",2
" Brilliantly done!
",I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this. At the very beginning I thought it would be a pointless film of how perfect you should look and how you should act a certain way in order for society to like you.<br><br>How wrong I was!<br><br>I thought the script was hilarious but also inspirational. One moment I was laughing then the next tearing up.<br><br>The actors done such an amazing job!<br><br>Ryan Gosling as Ken was such a good choice he played it brilliantly.<br><br>My Daughter loved it and came away with the right message that you shouldn't have to fit in to any type of box that you should just be you as that's enough!,10
" I get what you're saying, but..
","As a woman, I could relate to every message and every line said in the movie. That may be the problem: verbally explaining through Baribe and Gloria's line most of the time rather than portraying what the problem is. It's like my mom giving me a lot of wonderful advice, but what changes me the most is what I see with my own eyes. To get the message crossed, 'Barbie' loses the tension of the story as time passes.<br><br>'Barbie' is upbeat, bright, and cheerful; the comedy aspect really works for adults as well. The first half is really great and engrossing, but from the part where Barbie &amp; Gloria and Mattel people go back to Barbieland, it loses power and attractions. 'I'm Just Ken' sequence is boring, and how Barbies solve the problem is super easy and simple because it's in Barbieland. I feel even defeated how gender inequality is treated this lightly and carefreely<br><br>Soundtrack is the best quality. Billie Eilish's song at the end almost saves the film. Four-minute song captures more essence and core of 'Barbie' than the film itself.",7
" Great Expectations
","This film exceeded all of my expectations A N D I was looking forward to seeing it. I wonder about any parents who might bring their children to see it expecting something quite different from what this film is. One hour fifty four minutes of fun from beginning to end. Satire, sarcasm , humor at every turn. Production values and acting off the charts good. I can't believe Mattel let them make the movie with complete artistic freedom. Think of Nicole Kidman in the AMC promo before a movie starts and says, "" Somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this "". Well somehow watching a silly spoof like this movie feels great all the way through and even afterwards. I loved it and I am not surprised at the huge box office , this movie rocks.",8
" Strikingly bright, vibrant, colourful & musical fun - with a heavy-handed deeper message
","The colourful &amp; musical ""Barbie"" is set in the plastic uptopia of Barbieland - a Helen Mirren narrated doll's world of: 'Stereotypical Barbie' Margot Robbie; token Kens like Ryan Gosling (with HIS token Michael Cera) &amp; John Cena; empowered Barbies like Issa Rae &amp; Alexandra Shipp; and 'Weird Barbie' Kate McKinnon - into which existential confusion seeps (with Mattel CEO Will Ferrell) via a portal to the real world (thru America Ferrera (great)). Greta Gerwig directs with striking bright vibrancy, but her co-writing (with Noah Baumbach) is bogged in its 'struggle against the patriarchy' theme (despite a light veneer). It's fun - but with a heavy-handed message.",7
" ""You can be anything.""
","The story in Barbie isn't about a doll. It's about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.<br><br>We created them, and we can change them. We can make them what ever we want them to be. We can make ourselves what ever we want to be. The tag line for the barbie doll is ""You can be anything."" That in the point of the movie. You can be anything.",10
" Interesting satire that doesn't always hit the mark
","This is a weirdly complicated film. I wish I could say that was meant to be a compliment, but I found myself trying to figure out where all the pieces fit as the story unraveled.<br><br>The basic premise seems simple enough and the jokes in the first 30 minutes were pretty funny, but then you introduce ""real world"" characters into the movie after the first act (as shown in the trailer) and it seems to lose its way. Add to that an oversimplification of the male predicament and expected role in society set against an attempt at a nuanced view of the female's expected role and you're left with...mush?<br><br>Again, it has some decent satire one moment, but then also attempts to show heart the next. One example is how Ken discovers masculinity, but the way a 10 Year old boy might (trucks and horses), yet Barbie sometimes spouts off a simpleton's take on Camus or Neitzche. Honestly, at some points, there's a weird existential dread that flows out of her mouth, but Ken is kind of a moron.<br><br>Anyone who views men and women like this in real life might have a hard time maintaining long term, meaningful relationships and should probably seek therapy.<br><br>I wanted to like this more than I could.",6
" Why, Margot, why??
","Two of my favorite actors - Margot and Ryan - in an unbelievably predictable and poorly written movie. Why would you do this to yourself Margot?? I mean, she did say in an interview that she just wanted to work with Greta, she didn't even care in what capacity. I seriously doubt she even read the script. She just wanted to be part of it. But she should have read the script. Margot is better than this! I think even a 12yo could have guessed that this was a horrible script. It was basically men vs women. Who wants to make a movie about that!!? No one. But they did. And they called it Barbie.<br><br>The movie is absolutely breathtaking to look at. The cinematography and the costumes and the sets... it's all top notch. They spared nothing when it came to making this movie. Which is why I gave it 4 starts. Also, Margot and Ryan did the absolute best with what they were given. You could tell they really had to dig deep for this one.<br><br>But back to the awful script. Why?!<br><br>Someone with a brain somewhere out there must have read the script and thought to themselves ""I won't tell them... it's none of my business!"" Well, you should have!!! This movie cost so much money to make and so much talent was wasted on it. This could have been sooooooooo good. Instead, it was boring, predictable, trivial, preachy, and dull. Nothing original. Quite bland if you take all the color out of it. This movie would literally be a total zero if you watched it in black and white... That should basically tell you everything about it.",4
" Not the movie you think its going to be
","I expected this to be horrible, ditzy stereotypes, poor portrayal of each gender, or a best a 2 hour long advertisement for their toys.<br><br>It was not.<br><br>I cannot believe I am saying this, but this was an incredibly intelligent film! Prior to seeing it, that is the last thing I would expect to say, but it really was.<br><br>Clever and witty throughout.<br><br>Poor gender stereotypes? No, just the opposite. By showing how stereotypes existed in the Barbie world, then the real world and how they would later collide, it shined a light on the challenges of both genders, in again a clever and witty way.<br><br>A two hour commercial? No, Mattel used it as a way to apologize for some of the mistakes it made with dolls over the years (Sugar Daddy Ken), but even then in such a clever way. This was both an affirmation of what good Barbie has done, but also an apology for all the harm it has caused with unrealistic stereotypes.<br><br>Yes, it had a social agenda (again a surprise from what I went in expecting), but it succeeded in its goal without hitting you over the head, or with low brow humor.<br><br>It was clever, witty and intelligent. In other words, exactly what your not expecting.",9
" Cute existentialism
","Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?",7
" Didn't live up,to the hype.
","I think the extensive hype and the long standing popularity of the Barbie brand are responsible for bringing several generations of fans into the theaters resulting in the opening sales. It certainly isn't the movie, itself. The storyline was overly simplistic, poorly written and I didn't find its style of absurd humor to be funny. The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays ""actress Barbie"" in everything she does, so it wasn't anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all. The concept of patriarchy certainly isn't anything new and IMO there are much better films on the subject - starting with any of the Jane Austin films and this director's other film - Little Women.",3
" Babes in toy land.
","'Barbie (2023)' truly is an accomplishment, a shockingly successful blend between a mass-appeal blockbuster and a strange slice of surreal existentialism. There isn't anything quite like it and, although it essentially serves as one giant advertisement for its eponymous doll, it feels like a genuine piece of almost outsider art with a great sense of humour and a ton of heart. It's an incredibly well-crafted feature. The cinematography, set design and costuming all hit the nail squarely on the head, to the point that the pastel plastic aesthetic of Barbieland is so compelling and so complete that it honestly feels as though the movie has become live-action once Barbie and Ken make their way to the real world (even though the flick has been live-action since its first frame). The performances help with this, too, as the actors not only throw themselves from head to toe into the absurdity needed to fully embody the unreal nature of their characters but also deliver their lines with pitch-perfect timing and genuine emotion. All the Barbies and all the Kens (and Allan) are great, but Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling truly are the stars here. The former is absolutely brilliant, nailing the emotional dichotomy of her character's mindset as she undergoes her journey, and the latter just seems as though he's having a great time, living that quintessential Ken lifestyle without an ounce of embarrassment. It's also nice to see Will Ferrell being funny again, popping up as a CEO who seems like he just might be Buddy the Elf all grown up (it's not like he ever stopped being funny, per se, but he's been in some rough movies recently), and America Ferrera is great in her more down-to-Earth yet refreshingly honest role.<br><br>Although the movie is perhaps a little unfocused at times, its important messaging rings true from beginning to end. It satirises the patriarchy and highlights its inherent ridiculousness without undermining the genuine damage it has caused and continues to cause. It is, at its heart, a wonderfully feminist film. It seems to have been made by women for women, but it's so universally affecting (not to mention fun) that it resonates with everyone in its audience (as a man, I was more than happy to be along for the ride). Furthermore, its potent feminist elements are only slightly dampened by the fact that they have been packaged into a shiny product that's easily digestible by pretty much everyone (save for the whiny babies whose typically toxic masculinity is so fragile it can actually be threatened by this deeply silly yet deeply truthful movie). The picture does pull back slightly in its third act to take a more centrist approach, which does cause this movement to ever-so-slightly lose its way. However, its nuanced take on the material still feels markedly human and, though it takes a (likely studio-mandated) safe route, the flick goes in the right direction. In fact, it arrives at its intended destination mostly unscathed, primarily thanks to its supremely emotionally resonant coda. This is actually a big win for such a big-budget blockbuster; Mattel do pat themselves on the back quite a bit with their exceedingly generous depiction, but they don't seem to have been scared of a little controversy and that's unusual for a company of their size. Using something with such wide appeal to convey feminist ideas is a good way to introduce those ideas to people perhaps unlikely to otherwise seek them out, which arguably justifies the fact that those concepts have to be slightly watered down in this context. It's almost like feminism 101, in a way. Of course, the people who need to hear this stuff the most are already out there burning Barbies at the mere thought of the picture, but those who've perhaps not thought about these things before (perfectly nice but utterly clueless boyfriends, for example) may have learnt something once the credits roll (if they're open-minded enough to allow their perception to be challenged). At the very least, the piece is prompting discussion and will make almost every woman in its audience feel seen in a way they likely haven't by a movie in quite some time.<br><br>As an aside, I'm not sure how much of the film would work for kids, and it doesn't really seem like they're even part of the intended demographic. Greta Gerwig and co are clearly more interested in unpacking what Barbie represents as a whole than they are in selling new Barbie toys to children and that's okay. Not every piece of branded media needs to cater to the youngest in its audience, and this is potentially a good way to introduce youngsters to feminism and the patriarchy (I'm not a child psychologist or a parent, though, so perhaps take that with a grain of salt).<br><br>Ultimately, this surrealist satire is an emotional rollercoaster of an experience that's as silly as it is sincere. It's just such a good time. It's delightfully camp and surprisingly profound, centred around some fantastic performances that bring to life a brilliant screenplay under some amazingly assured direction. It's enjoyable, affecting, funny, heartbreaking, poignant, affirming, exciting, absurd, intelligent, important, slightly unsettling and unlike anything else out there. It's actually something of a miracle in its own way. If you tell me you didn't cry when you watched it, I won't believe you.",8
" Barbie
","""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",7
" All Things Considered, It's Perfect.
","When I first heard about this movie, I didn't want to see it. Then I watched the trailer and my mind was changed instantly. Margot Robbie as Barbie could not have been a better casting choice, Ryan Gosling as Ken was just *chef's kiss*. It's a wonderfully beautiful and talented cast. It's charming, funny, touching, powerful and overall perfect. The soundtrack is fantastic, I've been listening to I'm Just Ken on repeat for days now. The diversity and representation within the cast is beautiful and so exciting to see in a movie as big as this one. Greta Gerwig and everyone who worked on this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park.",10
" Stereotypical Barbie becomes a martyr for DEI Barbieland
","When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.<br><br>Of course, this is all the plot oversimplified to its core. The moments of unabashed humor, and there is lots of it, speak for Gerwig's witted personality...unfortunately the preachy tone carried throughout the movie also does too. The film has its moments, even if the ending leaves some viewers indifferent. It's probably worth the watch if you just want a few chuckles and nothing more.",7
" Loved everything about it
","I think Barbie has always been about women empowerment and I'm glad there's a Barbie movie that doesn't tiptoe around it to spare feelings. This movie was not marketed towards kids, it was clearly meant for adults who grew up with Barbie. It's an important message and it was told well. The cinematography was also incredible. Loved the costumes, the casting, everything about it. Margot played a literal perfect Barbie. I loved the scene where she was supposed to be ""ugly"" and the narrator made a joke about Margot being the wrong person to cast if you wanted to make an ugly scene with her. Ryan gosling also have an amazing performance as Ken. Even when he was being a douche he still came across lovable.",10
" Fantastic production but why did they go trying to make it all introspective
",I took my whole family to this movie thinking it was something we all could enjoy at least a little. My two girls are 6 and 8... I realized going in that it's mostly for adults but I wasn't expecting it to be totally for adults given the theme. Too bad. My oldest daughter was so disappointed by it that she was crying after and didn't understand it to be honest - she thought it was going to be more fun because we watched the trailers over and over. I mean it was a fantastic production and a lot of creativity went into making the Barbie world but why did they have to make the Barbie characters so introspective. So much crying and melodramatic parts for a movie that should be geared towards a kids imagination. And why did the ending need to be so lame. I thought at the very list they could have ended it on a fun note for the kids but the ending really sucked for my daughters.,6
" Worst movie ever
","We saw the movie because everyone was talking about it. Specially the rebirth of barbie and the political message (feminism) were supposedly great. Well after 10 minutes we already wanted to walk away fromt he movie. Its totally overhyped, bad script, sort of these typical teenage american football humor movies, which is very cheap and dull to watch. There was litterally nothing entertaining or nice about the movie. The scenes in the matell headquarters were overly childish. Maybe one truth was well demonstrated in the movie: everything was pink, the houses in barbieland did not have walls and the drinking cups and shower had no fluids in them. Oh yes and barbies car had no engine.",1
" Unexpected joy watching this film
",Wasn't sure how good this film was going to be but the trailer suggested something magical and the film fulfilled my vision. Congrats to the director who's also the writer with her husband I believe. To the great production design. To the actors especially Margot Robbie and Ryan gosling who continues to amuse and surprise with his ability to switch characters and add humor and a little bit of fun to his roles. And he gets to sing again. Recommend for all ages really but certainly any kid that's over eight or nine should be able to understand half of what's going on and the parents or friends can explain the rest. Enjoy.,8
" Not All That Clever
","I regret that I allowed myself to be swept up by the Barbie hype.<br><br>I'm sure it will resonate with the ladies.<br><br>Gents, you can wait 'til it streams.<br><br>It's just not nearly as clever as I'd hoping it'd be. Yes, I was fully expecting a message, but not one that would be hammered onto our heads.<br><br>Zero subtlety and a deficiency of real wit.<br><br>There was a moment in the film that held promise, re: Ken and the subject of masculinity, but it was squandered.<br><br>This film is very fortunate for the Barbenheimer phenomenon, because I'm not sure word of mouth could have served it as well.<br><br>I love me a chick flick - just not this one.",6
" Bait-and-Switch Barbie
","Summary: This isn't the fun, light-hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe. It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary. In fact, the plot and protagonist of the film is the patriarchy and more specifically men. The result is a sexist film that can be good at times but frustrating for many viewers. The movie may even be damaging to woman (explanation below).<br><br>Full Review:<br><br>I will justify my summary above but I want to first share that the film has a tremendous amount of potential and that I will be looking forward to a sequel should it come out. The cast is excellent. Gosling absolutely steals the show and is clearly having a ton of fun. Robbie is also a gem and is the quintessential Barbie. They could not have picked a better cast. The set design was fun and probably exactly what you would hope for in a Barbie film. The tempo was great, the cameos were fun, the movie was appropriately self-aware, the humor generally landed well. It's probably not a kids movie and I think that I wouldn't want my kids to attend it do to the adult humor and the social commentary bit. I think that for the right audiences the social commentary might elicit some good discussions and may be interesting to some.<br><br>I don't mind social commentary but I'd prefer to know that its in the film before I go. If I do go see a movie with social commentary its not generally as clunky as the movie Barbie is. For example, after the movie I asked several people what they thought was the message of the movie and no one person had the same answer. Surely the message centers around feminism or woman's empowerment. These are themes that generally everyone can get behind but the movie isn't clear on specifics. Does the movie intend to convey that Barbie is problematic as a doll or symbol? Is the movie suggesting the patriarchy is a problem? Is it that woman can do anything they put their mind to it? Is it saying the diversity is important? Basically... the movie fails to pinpoint what exactly it is trying to comment on.<br><br>Generally if you go see a movie that is intended to be social commentary then you should come out of it with thought provoking questions and ideas. It should be a movie that ""flips the script"" so that if you are on the opposite side of an issue you become more aware/informed after watching the movie. Unfortunately Barbie doesn't do this. Barbie lives in a fantasy world but the real world n the film is also a fantasy. She doesn't face any real world or realistic dilemma causing us to evaluate the gender systems we have in place. Even the times Barbie is subjected to discrimination or sexism (which is fairly constant) these times are not realistic or believable. Thus the commentary comes off as preachy and anecdotal.<br><br>Barbie is also not a role model or a hero in the movie. It's weird watching a movie that is written to empower woman while also featuring a weak and sexist female lead. The film begins with Barbie dismissing men and being biased towards woman. I don't want to leave any spoilers but.... SEMI-SPOILER... the movie ends with things being unequal between the sexes. As a result the film almost suggests that the sexes shouldn't be treated equally. In other words, its clear Barbie and Barbie the movie believes females are the superior gender.<br><br>Moreover, Barbie is not a strong and powerful woman. We are told in the movie that Barbie is an inspiration to woman fairly constantly. Normally I would agree. But the Barbie in this movie is depicted as uncapable and weak. She is egocentric and motivated by a desire to be beautiful. In fact, the entire plot kicks off because she finds cellulite on her legs and it later revolves around her self-centered interests to maintain power in her community. Its hard to relate or feel sympathetic under these circumstances and if anything the plot is an indictment on woman's (and societies) overuse of beauty and sexuality. As Barbie trots along her path she doesn't overcome anything on her own and she doesn't change as a person. In fact, everything she ""accomplishes"" is because someone told her what to do or because someone else did something for her. Not one time can I recall did Barbie accomplish something on her own or reevaluate her positions. By the end of the movie she is still the same problematic Barbie we were first introduced to. This is an interesting problem because it means that Ken, the movie's antagonist is actually the hero of the film. He is the only one in the film that overcomes adversity and is the only one in the film who grows and changes. We don't root for Ken, of course, but if you spend a few minutes thinking about his character arch you will realize he is actually the victim and the hero of the movie. This is what I meant by saying it is a clunky film - it has too many mixed messages, unexplored and unrealistic themes, and watered down but constant social commentary. Then add the fact that the social commentary expressed in the film is of a serious issue but is juxtaposed with a lighthearted comedic tone.<br><br>Then there is the problem with the movie's portrayal of men and specifically Ken. First, lets acknowledge how woman have been poorly portrayed in past by depicting them as weak and needing men. We can agree its inappropriate - so its confusing as to why the film does the same thing, except to men. Ken is portrayed as inferior to Barbie in every way when the appropriate thing to do would be highlight the strengths in both genders. A counter argument people may make is, ""Dude, its just a movie about a doll and its a fantasy land."" I get it, its not real. But the problem is the movie depicts men as inferior and stupid in both the fantasy and real world. In fact, there is little distinction between the men in both worlds. On the other hand, the woman in the real world are depicted more genuinely and certainly more intelligently. This leads me to conclude that the writers likely do have a problem with men even if they were trying to be humorous. In fact, there is a whole subplot with an all male corporate board that seems to be a non-sequitur. It seems its only purpose in the film was to dump on men or, in the alternative, the whole subplot was intended to be something intelligent but ended up being too poorly conceived to be meaningful in any way.<br><br>So, I have to say the film is disappointing and problematic in so many ways. But the potential is huge. I would look forward to a sequel but they have to drop the social commentary or, in the alternative, make a more cohesive movie with less mixed signals. Barbie should demonstrate why she is so amazing and earn her place at the top. We don't see why she is special or see her become the hero in her own movie. I expected to see a movie about a powerful woman who also likes to have fun. What I got instead was a bait and switch.",5
" Welcome to the Dollhouse
","Barbie: the symbol of pink, pastel perfection. An iconic piece of American pop culture for more than 50 years. But nothing can prepare you for her big screen debut.<br><br>Barbie is a risky and courageous new movie. This is a film that will be discussed and talked about for years to come. Greta Gerwig takes Matel's historic creation, every triumph and failure in its catalogue, and places it all within a complicated and challenging critique of what it means to be a woman. If I could compare it to another movie, I would say it's very reminiscent of Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle. It leaves you wondering what kind of insane negotiations went between the film's creative team and Matel, who is also one the targets of the film's purposeful ire. It is one thing to have completed this film, and absolutely another for it to have also gotten the overwhelming promotional campaign in the months leading up to its release. Gerwig's bet is paying off big time, and you have to admit, that takes a lot of guts.<br><br>Concept alone certainly isn't the film's only strength. The film is beautiful to look at. The production design is second to none in its meticulous construction of a real-life Barbie paradise. Respectively, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give fantastic performances with plenty of complexity and dimension. I was the most touched by Rhea Perlman who gives a heartwarming portrayal of the founding mother of Barbieland, Ruth Handler. Gerwig and Baumbauch's screenplay is biting and irreverent, and by the end, nobody is left unscathed. But equally so, I belly laughed quite often and marveled at how well so many of the jokes land. The emotional depth of the film also struck a very powerful cord, complete with an ending montage that can practically leave anyone misty-eyed.<br><br>Having been released on the same day as Oppenheimer, it's safe to say that the event movie is back and better than ever. After three years of streaming, it can't be overstated how wonderful that is.",8
" Not as good as I hoped
","Like many, I saw the ads and read the hype surrounding this movie. And who would walk away from the perfect summer time movie that features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling? I mean just based on curiosty alone, what would a movie about a child's doll be about? So off to the movies we went. And after the first 2 minutes, I was already having a bad feeling about this one.....and I really wanted to like it. As expected, much of the movie happens in BarbieLand, a perfect little beach front community where everyone cherishes Barbie. Lots of singing and dancing, colorful scenery, character introductions and so forth. You wonder where the story is going and out of the blue comes the theme of death. So at this point, its no longer a kids movie IMO. And the story developes into Barbie's mission to cross in to the real world to save the person who's not happy with their Barbie doll. And by not happy, I mean depressed with thoughts of death. A pretty dark twist. So the mission begins with Ken and Barbie visiting LA. The story becomes a mix of several themes including female enpowerment, corporate greed and a push for a male dominated society. Although I chuckled a couple times, this movie never sucked me into the story to the point where I felt I wasnt in a theater, if you know what I mean. In fact, it felt like every 15 minutes I was hoping the movie was over. Margot and Ryan give outstanding performances, but the novelty of Barbieland quickly wears off, leaving the audience blasted with bubblegum pop music and watching Barbie disolve into an emotional trainwreck as she faces a personal identity chrisis. Of course, this becomes the stories message to tweens, that life's hard, its OK to fail and finding strength to succeed isnt easy, regardless of gender. Its an awkward movie in that it doesnt really fit for kids or adults, unless you ignore the story and just look at the pictures.",6
" Much Ado About Malibu...
","Finally stepped into the Barbie-verse with my wife and sons. The film is both simple and ambitious, which deftly allowed us to enjoy on a variety of levels. Probably best for you to see this before too long, and before you hear too much (indirectly or incorrectly) about the film imho.<br><br>Plenty of humor, cinematography and music. Notably the humor is often taking a good look in the mirror and then making a self-deprecating joke. That is quite a trick mirror for the old notion of Barbie. All four in our family shed a few tears at times, the film's plastic fantastic elastic aspects cast aside, there's a sweet heart beating beneath it all.<br><br>I'm not just talking about the ""you go girl"" vibe that one would expect and is definitely delivered. Ryan Gosling's Ken-ergy steals scenes but will he steal the vote in Barbieland? Personally, I don't buy the idea of this as an anti-man movie.<br><br>Yet it is a feminist movie, built from a base of durable individuality.<br><br>Another trick turned by this new Barbie is to take the old production line uniformity and humanize each of the many Barbies in this film. And yes, even Alan too!<br><br>Tempted to title this review as ""God Bless America"" as America Ferrera nails the most vital message here in a wonderful monologue. Ferrera really is excellent in this. The movie could become a Mother's Day tradition in a lot of homes.<br><br>You can find that monologue online along with so many other intricacies that went into this film, like who the lovely lady at the bus stop is in real life, and the fact that Margo Robbie via her Lucky Chap company chose Greta Gerwig and not vice-versa. That was a Frances A-Ha moment for me!<br><br>The last line of the film was a different kind of a-ha moment, a touch or two of humor but also maybe the one uniting aspect for a very diverse Barbie-verse of feminists.",8
" Kenough
","Synopsis: Barbie (Played by Margot Robbie) suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her. This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll.<br><br>This film is directed by Greta Gerwig and written by both Greta Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach. In case you did not know, Greta Gerwig is the writer and director of films like Lady Bird (2017) and Little Woman (2018). Both these films are astonishing in terms of the screenplay and dialogues. In addition, Noah Baumbach wrote, directed, and produced Marriage Story (2019) as well as Frances Ha (2012) that had Greta Gerwig as a lead actress role and a writer in the film. Both those films also stood out for mostly the screenplay that is very deep and realistic in terms of the story and dialogues. Therefore, the expectations of Barbie are very high especially that we are talking about having those big names as the filmmakers behind this film. However, the results are unfortunately not near their previous films, especially in-terms of the screenplay.<br><br>Barbie is a film that is in my opinion targeted mostly for adults. It is like the director described, ""a party for everyone, and everyone is invited"". But, young kids (especially today's new young generation) will feel like it's not the type of party for them. As well as the jokes that feel like mostly adults will get them, especially that some of them include some inappropriate language or idea.<br><br>The biggest flaws of the film are its most important parts, and the main story mainly evolves around them. Therefore, because they weren't done well, the film lost its balance at most times. Barbie touched on the topic of how a relationship between a mother and a daughter can be and the stages it goes through. This is being portrayed in the weakest way ever and that's due to many reasons mainly for not giving it enough time and discussing it very briefly. Therefore, no emotions or connections are created between both the mother's character and the daughter's character with audience members. As well as, using a young actress to portray the role of the daughter that can be played by someone else with better acting skills. Without spoiling, but, a shorter sequence near the end of the film between 2 irrelevant characters, was able to touch audience members' hearts in terms of that topic, better than the characters of the mother and daughter with their sequences that we spent nearly most of the film with trying to connect with their relationship. A huge aspect that had helped in making this sequence a successful one is Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for"" that was playing in the background during it. I an interview wit Billie, she goes by explaining how this song tells what she went through and felt in an. This can be heard in the song's lyrics and Billie's voice that makes this scene and song very real and original and goes so well with that scene in particular.<br><br>Another huge flaw is the portrait of the Mattel corporation with its executives, mainly played by Will Farrell as the CEO of Mattel. Very weak, and cringe at times that just made me rather want to go back to the BarbieLnad sequences or Barbie and Ke sequences.<br><br>Margot Robbie is just phenomenal as Barbie exactly like what everyone expected her to be. She proves herself as an actress that can be added to the list of one of the most significant actresses in the modern time. She is able to play most roles very well and that can be seen from her previous roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), or previously in Babylon (2022) as Nillie Lorey. On the other hand, Ryan gosling as Ken is shining in this film. I think most of the scenes that I laughed out loud in, where mostly because of jokes performed by Gosling with the help of his acting skills using facial expressions and body language that suits Ken's character and behaviour perfectly. Simu Lui proves himself in this film that he is better in comedy films rather than serious action drama films. I enjoyed his comedic Ken role here more tHan i enjoyed seeing him being a superhero and trying to play a character like Shang-Chu in marvel's Shang-Chi (2021).<br><br>Greta really uses all the memes and trends that people have created in regards to the Barbie movie on the different social media platforms, and uses them as the main core behind the comedy aspect of the film. These little details are what make Greta's films all different from each other. Also, this is what makes Barbie a film made for the fans specifically. For instance, everyone have seen the meme that is a picture of the gang from Goodfellas wearing suits and looking very fresh, with a caption on it that says: ""4 tickets for the Barbie movie please"". This can clearly be seen in the film as many jokes had a similar idea that evolves around those jokes that you would end to your buddy on Tik Tok or Insta. One of my favourite lines said by Ryan Gosling's Ken is: ""Every night is boys' night"".<br><br>Finally, props to all production design, custom design and editing team that was able to portray BarbieLand and all the different Barbie and Ken versions exactly how they were suppose to look with their pink and colourful world and customs which is a thing that I personally was worried about. The results are more than ""KENough""<br><br>My rating is 8/10<br><br>Watched on July 20th, 2023

" Spectacular!
",Family/adult film mashed in really well! The trailer barely shows anything about how deep the movie is; I really appreciate that! I'm sure production design will surely get recognition at the Oscars I love that they used so much pink they had to get more. I saw it inRPX with my sister Emily which was quite spectacular except for several audience members that were obnoxious and barely seemed into the movie those people like that are strange.<br><br>I probably laughed at more parts than most people and was engaged throughout. Greta Gerwig made an important film with plenty of charm for everyone involved.,9
" Preaching not required...
","I thought the first half of the movie was quite humorous, taking the Mickey out of the whole Barbie phenomenon that it is.<br><br>Great colour and cinematography and I even laughed in some parts. Then something strange happened about half way through: it got all serious and made Ken a baddie and then decided to preach to us about the injustices that women have endured (which I agree to be true, but didn't fit where I thought this movie was going).<br><br>Not quite sure who this movie was intended for, but I walked out disappointed. The males all ended up being either bad or stupid, or both. Not sure if this is a film that the great Will Ferrell can hold his head up high for as his role served very little purpose.<br><br>The acting and cinematography saved it.",6
" Could have been soo much more
","As a young child I played with barbies. Had the house had a Ken and had the car etc but this film didn't create any humorous nostalgia at all. Soo many opportunities were missed. The looks were pretty bland and it could have been pushed soo much further. Yes there was a message but the message was relentlessly dragged on and on and everything was just, well a bit meh! The story didn't make much sense and there were no laugh out loud moments more of little ha moments that passed quickly like a pretty dull knock knock joke that you'll forget in a second. Such a shame. All of it was just.... bland.",5
" A great fun film for PG-13 and up
","I haven't seen a movie so funny, energetic, and overall amazing like this one in a very long time! I had somewhat high expectations, due to the good reviews (and the not good ones) and i love Margot Robbie and her acting, she was under-rated in Babylon. I'll just say, that my expectations were definitely reached! While funny throughout this movie is is fully hilarious at times, even if you think it would be some stupid ""all pink and glitter and rainbows"" flick, you'll definitely laugh (and you'll probably love it!). It's insanely funny and honestly touching in some scenes. It speaks a great message as well! Overall, will definitely watch again!",9
" Cute movie
","This is the story of old doll Barbie (since many years ago but presented here as a young beautiful woman). She is suffering a crisis about herself and her existence and wants to go to the real world to have it solved. We see nice images from the real world and the Barbie's world and see several other Barbie doll types all along the movie. This story develops itself by a lot of conflicts mainly because at a certain time her lover Ken betrays her and tries to be the leader of Barbie's world which makes Barbie and her allies to fight him and his followers till the end in several intricate scenes till he is defeated and Barbie becomes a real woman with the help of Ruth, her creator. Not a particularly good movie in terms of story but technically excellent.",6
" Avoid like the plague
","A confused, misfiring, tedious and pretentious affair. I was expecting much better, yet ultimately disappointed. Margot Robbie (and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling) is very good, but otherwise even she can't save this twaddle. Don't listen to the critics - it is crap!<br><br>Pros: the opening scene apeing '2001 a Space Odyssey' was funny.<br><br>Cons:
It needed better editing to create a more coherent structure
It had very dull patches (despite the pink)
The emphasis on the 'patriarchy' was definitely laid on too thick
Will Ferrell was not funny in this. He needs to really understand that whatever comes out of his mouth is not necessarily instant comedy gold.<br><br>Avoid!!!!!",3
" Give Greta more than Nolan everyday
","There is first in every thing.<br><br>And there's the first on a new thing.<br><br>Greta Gerwig has never disappointed me. Even when she was at her point with the mumblecore genre. Now she bring her class and weirdness to a new top level.<br><br>With Barbie Greta make the viewers never distracted but confused, in such a glam and fun colorful wave.<br><br>Greta has done perfectly the accuracy and portrayal of certain dolls and places in Barbie's fabulous and magic world. Additionally, the pacing and storytelling choices feeling that it may bring directly in your cinemas the wonderful, fun, witty and very magic world that is the one of Barbie.",10
" A sales pitch
","A very confusing plot, under-developed characters and a haughty attitude to glorify the plastic doll in all possible ways, mixing patriarchy, feminism, women's rights, gender equality, sex etc etc. Mattel did everything they could to ruin a good concept, but I am sorry it's just a plastic doll.<br><br>There are some interesting points, like the emotions of Barbie and Ken when they visit the real world for the first time, but they quickly move away from it and is not fully developed. The way they move in the Barbie world, is it children moving them in the real world, and speaking for them? Not-developed. The weird doll, what happened to her, how does she feel? Not-developed. The mother and daughter role? What's their purpose? Not-developed. The CEO and CFO? What's their story? What's their purpose? Not-developed. That Alain dude? Not-developed.",6
" Funny movie, live-action, comedy, cool and amazing
","Barbie, the movie is great! It stars Margot Robbie as the character Barbie! There's also some so many starring actors/actresses who are also in that movie who they are fictitious! This movie is great for all viewers to watch, including millions people across the nation worldwide! The movie is a comedy, live action, and funny! Margot Robbie is an inspiring actress known for her movies, such as I, Tonya, About Time, and so much more! This movie is an inspiration for people who want to watch and see! Viewers who want to watch this movie watch it anywhere, anytime! Thank you, and have a nice day!!",10
" South Park episode on an acid trip
","I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie . It was weird to me but in a very good way and LOL at the ending , made everybody laugh . Check it out , I say it's worth a view in the theatre.",7
" Growing up & Finding who you really are...
","I certainly didn't expected this film to be what it is...<br><br>Growing up (realizing the world around you, yourself) anxiety, depression, responsibilities, relationships and more but it resonated with me mostly from Ken's POV.<br><br>To love or caring someone while ignoring your own identity and needs, try to please with your every second leaves you empty. And it's not fair for anyone on either side.<br><br>This film isn't just about feminism or female empowerment, it's about growing up and finding who you really are, and what is your actual purpose. Which is the hardest thing for anyone, including myself...<br><br>Thank you Greta Gerwig and the crew!",8
" Barbie: an enjoyable mess.
","Barbie is enjoyable, thats for sure, but it brings some problems such as the films plot, which is all over the place, and goes in a lot of unlikable directions at times. However, this doesn't bring the film down, as there are enjoyable and smart aspects of the film that climb the hurdles to make Barbie an enjoyable summer watch that caters for all ages!<br><br>The film kicks things off in Barbie land, and its here where audiences will start to fall in love with the aesthetics of the film. Astonishing set designs,usage of visual fx and cinematography really help us step into the shoes of a Barbie doll. The first act of the film really focus on this idea, and almost shows off the impressive work that has been put into the creation of this sublime world.<br><br>It is when we delve further into this plot though that we start to see issues. The whole vibe the film gives off and its tone surprisingly shifts into something much darker and political when the real world gets involved. It is definitely far from unwatchable though, and the charm of the characters and the humor actually make this specific part of the storyline enjoyable. Despite being fun, the story goes off track a lot, completely ignoring any form of logic to take risks by giving off a little too many messages that only makes the plot more predictable and cliché.<br><br>The individual, interior journeys these characters go on though is the clear standout of the film for me. The arcs of almost all characters are played out really cleverly, and whilst the story as a whole is a mess, the developing dynamics between the Barbie's and the Ken's make this film worth watching alone. What is done with these characters is really fitting to some of the messages the film tries to give off, even though it may seem there are too many to process.<br><br>Acting is phenomenal. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are CLEAR standouts, yet all cast members have their moments.<br><br>Ultimately, Barbie does get messy, especially when the real-world comes to play. Yet its the exploration of Barbie Land and what it means to be a barbie that make this a fun, yet somewhat perceptive, summer watch!",7
" Atrocious
","Don't know where to begin. This movie is a bland salad. Can't believe I actually see people throwing around the word masterpiece to describe this complete and utter trash of a movie. Jaws, schindlers list, inception, kill bill. Those are masterpiece. This movie is master poop. If u are having trouble falling asleep then watch the first half of the movie. It's a snoozer. Script is clumsy. This movie is what is wrong with cinema and television as of late. Don't know who they are making movies for. This is definitely not for the general public. This isn't a movie anyone wanted to see. The masters like Christopher Nolan could fart a better movie than this.",1
" Who'd Have Thought It?
","Who'd have thought that you could make a film about the Barbie doll. Well Greta Gerwig obviously did and what a rip-snorting entertaining piece of colourful fun it is. And on so many different levels too: socio-political commentary, gender roles, off-the-wall mayhem to mention three. There are homages to classic films from the very start that had me rolling with laughter, and it never let up.<br><br>In some ways I was reminded of Yellow Submarine seasoned with a strong dose of Legally Blonde.<br><br>If there was anything that dragged it was the ending. So many excellent films barrel along with one plot twist or other surprise after another (Barbie certainly does) and then there's the question of how to tie up the loose ends and provide a believable ending, and in context too. Barbie just about manages it, if a bit hokey. But then there's the final scene. It's a cracker!",10
" Between matriarchy and patriarchy.
","I like F-Rating movies, to know and understand women, especially the hidden value of feminism around the story scenario, and of course there is no doubt what makes it Grate Gerwig. Although this time, there is no Saoire Ronan in my opinion is the best chemistry between directors and actresses for female films. This work Barbie, comes set in Barbieland's fantasy that depicts the irrational of a woman. The moving plot of the Barbie fantasy world, conflict increases when entering the world of reality, and the ending is resolved according to the maturity of the story, which is a red herring type of plot; what is meant is that the author diverts the audience's minds, as in this film Barbie has to correct flat soles, but it is not the essence of the Basically the director wants to convey the feminine phase, with an amazing fantasy idea, between the difference between the world of reality and the world called Barbieland.<br><br>I went straight to the point, which was the first time that Barbie, like women in general, felt insecure, she realized that her feet were flat when she stepped on the sand on the beach. This is my favorite scene, because it reminds me of my childhood, when I saw my sister crying because her Barbie doll didn't stand up straight. I got the meaning from that scene, that in real events women often do not suspect their shortcomings in public places, in this film Barbie is a woman's childhood imagination playing with Barbie dolls, thus avoiding damage or defects in a doll. This adds up to Barbie's wish to go to the real world, to repair the soles of her feet, and the plot twist is that there is a childhood human, who has a barbie doll toy in the form of the main character Barbie, played by Margot Robbie. This is as if a woman will try her best to find the best treatment, in order to eliminate physical deficiencies, regardless of the morals contained in her, even though she is Margot Robbie too.<br><br>The scene between the world of reality and the world of Barbie, in this case my analogy, the world of reality is represented against liberalism, and the world of Barbie is imagined conservatively, this imagination creates matriarchy in the fantasy world of Barbie by feminism, while the opposite of reality, there is control of the world of Barbie by companies acting in a patriarchal manner. Then the scene of an elderly grandmother, namely Ruth, whom Barbie first met, accidentally sat next to Ruth. My intuition at this moment, seeing the happiness of an old woman, whose beauty is faded but full of precious experiences, thinking that beauty can disappear, and that's what Barbie feels when she looks back at Ruth, and also makes Barbie aware of her question about 'death' in the musical scene at the beginning of the film . This is where Barbie's maturity signifies when she returns to Barbieland.<br><br>So that at the ending point, the message of this film that describes the growth period of a woman, and the slogan ""She's everything. He's just Ken"", I interpret women as creatures that are unpredictable, experience social phenomena that occur, want to try new things until they get their point of freedom, the purpose of life is understanding everything, pride in being a complete woman who is, in expressing herself in a complex environment , especially women who live in a patriarchal environment. Finally, Barbie realized the meaning of girl, mother, grandmother, and chose to act as an independent woman without admiring men, in this case, Ken.<br><br>Overall, the scenarios that are played are quite fast and do not create unnecessary scenes, the accompaniment of music to pause the audience brings the neatness of cinema that is of theatrical art value, plus sarcasm scripts that contain, in terms of the capture of the ratio of connoisseurs and comedy humor. Regarding production design, without a doubt, maybe I championed this award was obtained by Barbie at the 2024 Oscars, because from that side it really broke marketing, the pink color is like a mandatory costume for anyone who watches. I give Barbie: 7.5/100.",7
" Preachy, vapid, and disappointing
","I went in with my sister who grew up watching animated Barbie movies since she was a kid like ""Barbie: Princess Charm School"" or ""Barbie: Princess and the Popstar"" or ""Barbie: Rapunzel,"" etc. I was excited, but more for her, because I know how much Barbie means to her. But sadly, she and I were very disappointed.<br><br>Like to my sister, Barbie means something to girls everywhere, teaching the important and necessary values aimed at women, and giving them a role model to look up to. But after seeing this movie I can't tell you what Barbie stands for.<br><br>In ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie's character is called a ""fascist"" and a terribly unrealistic image of a perfect woman. Ken is emasculated, fed sexist stereotypes and turned into a joke. The rest of the other Barbies are manipulative and standard feminist archetypes.<br><br>I'm not political, but there's an obvious message the writers are pushing here. And it's not subtle at all. Men are worthless and Barbie's unique femininity is problematic.<br><br>The best thing about the film is its wonderful costume design and special effects. But sadly, that's about it for ""Barbie.""",5
" La Vie en Rose
","I'm not one of those people who feel the need to apologize for watching 'Barbie'. In my opinion there are no bad movie genres, there are only good movies and bad movies. And the cinema is also popular entertainment, and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air-conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment can't be the worst thing on a hot summer day. 'Barbie', Greta Gerwig's film did not make me regret the decision to watch it for at least three quarters of its duration.<br><br>Barbie lives in an ideal world called Barbieland. Actually, I should use the plural, but I don't really know how, because it's not just about the blonde doll we all know, but about all the incarnations she has received over the decades - blondes and brunettes, with white, yellow, black or other skin colors, thinner or bigger. The multiple Barbies have the most diverse professions, from doctor to Nobel laureate writer, from astronaut to president of the United States. Ultimately, the Barbie universe was imagined to give courage and self-confidence to little girls and instill in them the idea that anything is possible. There are also boys, they are generally called Ken, but their purpose is to be the Barbies' (asexual) partners when those are willing to pay attention to them. The introduction to the film is excellent, with a quote from Kubrick's 'A Space Odyssey' and voiceovers narrated by Helen Mirren. When stereotypical blonde Barbie starts getting into trouble, the source is in the real world. Barbie must face reality and the conflict between universes is inevitable. The real world is not like the ideal world and the mixture of them will cause a revolution in Barbieland that will not necessarily be in the right direction. The awakening to reality or, if you will, the humanization of Barbie comes at a price.<br><br>'Barbie' - the movie works well most of the time, especially when the focus is on the comedic and musical side and the message is integrated into the entertainment. The production is excellent. The sets, the costumes, the cinematography will surely receive Academy Awards nominations, and in some categories 'Barbie' may be the winner. The soundtrack reminds at some points fragments from the history of the pop and ballad genres of the 70s and 80s. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent in the lead roles and I wouldn't be surprised if Barbie dolls borrow their faces (if they haven't already). The messages are well-punched and come across the screen quite well - genuine and fake feminism and the way Barbie products reflect society's conception of the place, role and appearance of women, the more or less camouflaged misogyny of contemporary society, corporations with their seemingly socially aligned messages camouflaging capitalist greed. All of this is well dosed and combined with what happens on screen until the final part of the film, when either the writers took themselves a little too seriously, or they did not have enough inspiration and instead of continuing to infuse the dissolved messages into entertainment they resorted to rhetoric and created an ending that I found forced and didactic. 'Barbie' was worth seeing for the fun part, for the colours, music and humour. When playing with dolls it is good not to be overly serious.",8

" This isn't the movie you think it is - and it's probably better for it.
","Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.<br><br>And yet what's truly amazing is that for all this, 'Barbie' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. I can't readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that's being shoved in our faces. Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it's nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. Everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. It bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. Then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what Mattel's signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. It's not inaccurate to say that 'Barbie' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven't actually seen it, or can't discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.<br><br>Meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. The cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but I personally am also very happy to see Hari Nef here so prominently, and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy. The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. Editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous. The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that I'd have never supposed even based on advance marketing. And as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren't enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. The scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. What here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? Well, I gave my answer when I first sat down, but even if it's not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. And if that's the worst that I can say about a picture, then I'd say it's done darn well for itself indeed.<br><br>The promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons I admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action Barbie movie on the big screen. The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still I had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. Then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. Suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' from ""a film I might like to check out if I have the chance,"" to a must-see. And now that I have? While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased, I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting. That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn't here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). What we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it's kept hidden. Ironically, I ponder if this isn't too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. Even if that's true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. When I was younger I'd never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: Gerwig's picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation.",8

Margot Robbie, Kate McKinnon, and Issa Rae are the most important Barbies. The most recognizable Kens are Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu. The plot, such as it is, initially features Stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) in a matriarchal Barbieland where Kens struggle for relevance and autonomy. However, Barbie begins to channel aspects of the ""real world"" of her original owner, and Weird Barbie (McKinnon) sends her to Southern California to engage her human connection. There she meets Gloria (America Ferrera) and her daughter, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). Barbie also encounters CEO (Will Ferrell) and Ruth (Rhea Perlman), the inventor of the Barbie doll.<br><br>The film follows the adventures of Barbie (Robbie) and Ken (Gosling) in California and their response to the patriarchy they find in the real world. This patriarchy has implications for life in Barbieland when they return. Everything happily resolves in the end.<br><br>I was frankly disappointed. There were genuinely amusing spots, but not the laugh-out-loud sequences mentioned by some reviewers. Robbie and Gosling are good with a thin script. ""Barbie"" is cotton candy feminism in support of a brand.",5
" Not as expected
","I went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism, but I found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie. I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.",8
" Super fun, super colorful, and very plastic!
","The entire cast does such a great job and it seems everyone had a fun time making the film. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are of course stand outs, but Michael Cera as Allan and Issa Rae as Barbie were also phenomenol! The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!<br><br>However, this is still a movie made to appeal to the widest audience to make the most money possible. There's some popular feminism, but nothing that challenges status quo, and nothing too disagreeable for the average audience. It's pretty to look at, but lacks adequate substance in favor of just bringing up the talking point to say they acknowledged it. Furthermore the movie is extremely uninterested in exploring anything about Mattel's business practices or perpetual consumerism. Not that I was expecting it to, but both those potential issues are very blatantly sidelined and made for humor which sometimes feels like a bit much for me.<br><br>Anyways, if you want a pretty looking and pretty funny movie that'll definitely continue to make a stupid amount of money, it is well worth it!",7
" music video non-movie
","Barbie has color and some music and dancing. There's no movie in there though, as taken as a whole it's a mess of illogic and heavy handed pronouncements. The ""real word"" is as fake as a 3 dollar bill. A universe called real world might be thought of as portraying, well, the real world, but it doesn't. When straining for humor, it mostly doesn't work. Furthermore, none of the characters in Barbie are interesting or someone one wants to relate to in a narrative. Some of the historical Barbie items are interesting to look at. Why this movie is popular I don't know, but the film will soon be forgotten.",2
" Thought it would be cheesy
","But was pleasantly surprised. I found it very emotional. Fabulous casting, dancing and soundtrack. My daughters 6 and 8 also loved it. My husband even went along and got a few laughs but ended up at the pub with my youngest because the cinema in general was too loud for her. I can see how it could upset and make people uncomfortable that are after a comedy seen through the eyes of a stereotypical comedy director, but that is what makes this movie so different. Definitely bring some tissues if you have any sort of mother-daughter relationship, both good, bad and in-between. I am so glad I could see a movie like this with my daughters.",10
" Not much plot
","I totally get it. The themes, the message, the irony. It's just I expected way more of an actual story and to come full circle but it just left me feeling odd.<br><br>Positives: The film is beautiful and there's many laugh out loud moments. Both my partner and I did on many occasions. I liked the change from barbie land to real life. I liked the shock at seeing how much of a man's world we live in.<br><br>Negatives: I found the endless cameos and useless one liners really odd. From Will Farrells colleagues just popping up for one word to celebrities constantly saying 'hey barbie, bye barbie'. It just felt so odd.<br><br>The ending seemed to not really finish the movie. For me, I expected when the barbies got their homes back they'd then start a new way of life where they share with the Kens. Instead of going straight back to female only or female led spaces. Isn't that just as oppressive as the misogyny they're against in the real world? So they've not learnt from the events that have happened.<br><br>As well as the montage section I really didn't get that bit and I'm a 33yo female.<br><br>Maybe I set my expectations too high from all the hype. I would actually like to watch the movie again to see if I still feel the same.",7
" You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗
","<ul><li>Only Greta Gerwig can pull this movie off. She is the only one that can helm this movie right. No other directors can do what she did for this movie. Why? Because the others would end up making this movie as generic or as plain as possible aka 'just another commercial blockbuster movie'. Greta Gerwig was able to turn the wheels from the overly used direction, venturing into new territories most directors are afraid to go.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Barbie the Movie sends out strong messages and contexts about a lot of different things. Some of them include patriarchy, male-dominated world, female-dominated world, perfectionism, teenage-phase life, adulting, gender equality, equity, sexual objectifications amongst many others. Now, you must be shocked to hear all of this are conveyed in this film. A Barbie film that talks about all this stuff? YES. This is Greta's X-Factor, having to bring these sensitive subjects into a movie for everyone catered for all audiences. And children will still be entertained and understood with the story and the messages that Barbie brings to the table.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>It is definitely not an easy job trying to recreate the world of Barbie and make it a reality. Life in plastic, the team has to build Barbie Land from scratch. Everything needs to look right; the environment, the designs and the outfits. And Greta and the team did their research and you can clearly see it from the movie. Everything just comes to life the way they are supposed to be. Everything is plastic and yet, it's gorgeously constructed. The atmosphere, mood and tone really give that Barbie Land vibes.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>You need to acknowledge that this is a very meta movie. While Warner Bros failed at doing this with The Matrix: Resurrections, Barbie the Movie is a whole different story. They did this justice! It is self-aware that this film is about toys, that toys are not living objects, that someone else is controlling the narrative and they use this opportunity to create a story around this meta-themed element and it works! It works so well because the film is carefully constructed and impeccably paced, knowing what to serve the audience, when to be self-aware and how to blend Barbie's storyline with all the meta together, making the film as a stand out compared to other similar themed features.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Barbie the Movie, which prior to viewing, we thought that it was going all in for women empowerment. But it didn't. Instead, it's full with surprises that started off thinking it was going to be that but as the film progressed, it opened up to so many possibilities of perspectives and viewpoints because the story itself is not definite but subjective and timely. It touches on current issues that are important not only for women, but for men as well. It doesn't want to side with a certain group for people, what it wants is to get the message acroos right; to make sure that everyone gets the story they deserve.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>While the story unwraps, there are golden comedy moments of pop-culture references and sarcastic remarks that, if you knew what they're about, you'll be laughing because of how relatable it is with today's world or personal experiences OR because of you didn't expect that a film like this would have jokes so sarcastic. If you've ever played with any dolls or toys, if you always keep up with the news and if you truly understand what meta is, you'll get all the references.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>We had hoped when Ryan Gosling was casted as the main Ken. Well, we knew he was the perfect choice, to put it fair and square. His performance was good but because Margot Robbie was so freaking excellent and top-notch as the main Barbie, Gosling couldn't put his character on par with her, he overacted at times and the makeup department tried making him look young but the powder they put him on actually made him look the total opposite. If you'd asked, Glen Powell would have been a better choice as the stereotypical Ken. He suits as a blondie, originated from Texas, his six-pack is crunched as seen in Top Gun Maverick and he has great comedic timing, evidently from Scream Queens.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Did at any time the message comes across as preachy? Holistically, no. But they did slip a bit somewhere at the end of 2nd act (middle) up until the beginning of 3rd act (finale) where it went a bit overboard. It became a bit 'on your face' and these scenes may be the reason that social media will explode with controversial discussions and arguments because of some viewers who feel threatened by the way the subjects are brought to the spotlight. We're all okay with this film but this bump they have makes it uneven from the remaining duration, in which everything is told very, very well.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Almost everything with Barbie the Movie is great, even the tiniest elements. The colour palette plays a huge part in this movie, the dialogues know how to be impactful, the music is ear-soothing and the extras are just as important as the supporting, everyone actually plays a part in maintaining the mood of the film.</li></ul><br><br>Verdict: Filled with contexts and messages as rich as Oscar-nominated films, Barbie the Movie is a whole different game as it is full with surprises and hard-hitting truths about the world we live in today. It is self-aware of what it is and Greta Gerwig daringly takes charge of crafting a masterpiece storytelling that capitalizes on the heavy subjects without downgrading anything or anyone, maintaining both its quality and substance the entire film. You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗",8
" Great execution, but its main message is nothing new
","I watched the Barbie movie a few weeks after it came out, so I was expecting to experience all the emotions people raved about on Twitter. Overall I thought the movie was well-produced, but I think its marketing was misleading. Now, I know that this movie couldn't be marketed in a way that was truthful to the plot because less people would go to watch; people wanted to see a movie about the bright and bubbly character of Barbie, not a Barbie whose whole persoality is a complete 180 from her original. With that being said, I think the message the mvoie was getting at of how people should be free to be who they are and not conform to society's standards, etc is nothing we haven't heard before, which brings up the question of did we really need a movie to tell us this? Another question I have is why did Ken have a song? It didn't benefit the plot but that can be left to your own volition. I wouldn't say I was disappointed in this movie, but I think it was overhyped just a little bit.",7
" Fantastic movie!!!
","Barbie was a great film. This movie is so well written and super clever. Makes you laugh, cry, and ponder what it means to live in today's world.<br><br>This film has a message for us all and makes some excellent philosophical points that will leave you thinking when the credits roll. It's that kind of movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie didn't go the cartoony, campy direction. It so easily could have. But it went a much more thoughtful and clever way than I ever would've anticipated. I predict this movie becoming a classic, totally quotable movie, for years to come. Most of all I enjoyed myself at the movies again.",9
" Robbie is perfection, Gosling is 'just okay'
","Barbie begins in a bubble-gum-coloured world of fun, fashion and perfection. Although Barbie is played by dozens of actors, 'Stereotypical Barbie' is played by Margot Robbie. Perfection in Barbie land doesn't last long though, as Barbie must travel to the real world to solve her sudden existential crisis. She meets both friends and foes along the way.<br><br>As Barbie and her new girl gang return to Barbie Land, they are horrified to see that it is now renamed 'Kendom', after Ken (Ryan Gosling) who initially tagged along with Barbie has discovered the patriarchy of the real world and wants to be seen as more than 'just Ken'.<br><br>With a star-studded cast full of cameos, Barbie's Margot Robbie is stunning, and I think the perfect choice for the title role. On a side note, it was nice to hear her not doing a Boston/New York accent for once. Ryan Gosling however took me out of the Ken fantasy. Character-wise he was great, but I see Ken as more of a Travis Van Winkle or Trevor Donovan type. Goslings' portrayal of Ken looked a bit sleazy, and the bleach-blonde hair did him no favours.<br><br>There is a lot of lore and fun easter eggs throughout the film that both young and old can recognize, and even if you don't have a history of playing with Barbies (which I cannot confirm or deny that I did), there is a sense of nostalgia too.<br><br>Bonus points for the phenomenal set and costume design, and a killer soundtrack too! I'd be disappointed if this film isn't up for any major awards for the above-mentioned.<br><br>Barbie was super fun! It's also a movie that can be watched for many years to come and still seem current and relevant.<br><br>#barbie #barbiethemovie.",6

" Not so sexist like I read?
","To see a universe that's a Barbie world where the Barbies are the rulers and the Kens are just there to support Barbie brings our universe into focus. Ken doesn't feel loved and respected or important in the Barbie world. He steps into the real world where men are respected and many thing revolves around them and he realizes that he can be more. I hope that this movie could help men feel more empathy towards women and the way this world makes them feel less valuable and important. Women couldn't own property before and in Barbie world Kens didn't have a home to call their own or any important positions.<br><br>Because women in the real world wear multiple hats, they have to be seen in many ways. They have to do many contradictory things to be liked. Women have to tie themselves in knots to be liked by other people. That's what this show tried to say too.<br><br>I wish the Barbies realized how they were excluding the Kens and not treating them with respect and made changes to fix that. The world we live in is so male focused that we are so used to it that it seems normal and not unusual. But just like everything being ruled and centered on the women in the Barbie world seems strange, you realize the reverse is strange too.<br><br>The movie had that message to me but it also was fun and light hearted and went by very quickly.

There were some funny scenes but at its core, it just had no depth, logic or meaning other than Barbie v. Ken. Let's present a fake world where either men rule and women are puppets or women rule and men are puppets. This reads like someone's thesis on the state of feminism in modern society. I feel bad for the families that took their children to see this expecting something lighthearted and fun. This was not it. Just silly...",2

From the moment the film began, I was captivated by its smart and subversive storytelling, which cleverly blends meta-humour with a dash of eccentricity.<br><br>The production design is a standout feature, a visually dazzling and wonderfully pink-themed universe. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is nothing short of impressive, skilfully capturing both the character's earnestness and humour. Her performance, combined with Greta Gerwig's skilful directing, makes for a truly entertaining and memorable experience.<br><br>Throughout the film, I found myself chuckling at the witty humour and enjoying the unexpectedly bold take on what Barbie represents. The movie strikes a fine balance between honouring the iconic brand and playfully challenging its conventions, resulting in a unique and rewarding cinematic experience.<br><br>While the film's intentions are commendable, there were moments when it felt like the themes could have been explored more deeply, leaving me slightly wanting more. Nonetheless, Barbie remains a fun and enjoyable ride, filled with charm and charismatic performances that made it stand out as one of the year's best comedies so far.<br><br>In the end, Barbie proves to be much more than just a marketing gimmick, showcasing a refreshing take on a beloved cultural icon and making it a must-see for anyone seeking a smart, humorous, and visually arresting cinematic adventure.",8

","The much anticipated Barbie movie. It's unreal to see a packed theatre 3 weeks after release, what a summer for movies.<br><br>This film was so much fun. I had a perpetual grin on my face the entire two hours, only growing wider with every joke. I'm glad I experienced it in a theatre setting, laughing along with others is a great feeling - and there was plenty of laughs to go around. Genuinely one of the funniest films I've seen in a while, the adult-targeted cultural/societal humour really, really worked. Theres not much to say about the set design, costume dept., hair, makeup, and sets other than its nothing short of awe-inspiring. The production design is pretty much flawless. Also, the movie references and homage payed to classics like 2001 and the Matrix was very, very much appreciated. My only complaint would be the third act of the film. I feel like the fast, satirical humour of the first two acts worked perfectly, challenging and poking fun at cultural, societal and political norms, but doing so in a clever way which serves the story and script - gracefully. The third act throws this creative ingenuity out the window by way of heavy handed, in-your-face monologues.",7

They'll still be having a good time, but it's the adults that are actually in for the big treat. I absolutely loved it and recommend this to everyone who loves a clever satire with a lot of heart and mesmerizing cinematography.<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfect in their roles, the script/story is engaging, funny but also very touching at times and the overall result is delightful.<br><br>You'll find yourself wanting to own this one in your collection, it really is that good.",10

Kidding). What the film offers is a lot of comedy which movie viewers will likely to enjoy. It pays homage to the different types of Barbie dolls but that depressed and ordinary Barbie were the best in this film. With Barbie, there comes Ken and Alan? But Ken was not sidelined in this film. In fact, I kinda felt more empathy on Ken's side than on Barbie's. Yeah this is a film based on Barbie who of course we know that without Barbie, there won't be a Ken. However, this film shows its viewers that it shouldn't be that way. Ken is as important as Barbie. On the other hand, that speech of ""Gloria"" was really moving and very inspiring.<br><br>This film takes us to a world where toys and humans interact. Where those who live in a cycle can break the chain and have a decision to make. Where every individual has a choice and every person in this world is as important as the other.<br><br>Barbie is 7/10. Enjoyable, fun for family however as my friend have said, there were scenes in this film that felt like ""what's next?"" or some parts felt like fillers.

Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references.

","First impressions of the movie where mixed. The script is pretty much garbage. It sends a solid message about equality while somehow does the exact opossite.<br><br>It tries to create a society where men and women are at the same level and all bodies and races have the same value but also does the opposite making sometimes girls look much inferior than men and men inferior than women.<br><br>The movie is about laughing at how basic, stupid and ignorant the fan base of the movie really is. If you went to the theater wearing all pink and well dressed then you are what I'm talking about.<br><br>I must say it was a fun movie that made me laugh at some points. It was so fun to see how ignorant the people watching this movie are that made me also laugh and be worried about how the society has fallen. I went to see the movie making a double session after seeing Oppenheimer so that may be why I notice the difference about the audience.<br><br>If you are a girl and you laughed a bit too much then maybe you should go and search for a psychiatrist because if you like being made fun off then you have some problems.<br><br>Basically, if you are a guy taking over a girl then you are bad. If you are a girl taking over a guy then it's all good. The movie supports the extreme left, politically btw.<br><br>At the same time it also teaches guys and girls that they don't need each other and can live by their own. It's a journey about finding yourself and what it means to be a guy or a girl. It tries to take out stereotypes by saying all bodies are perfect but when Barbie gets cellulitis it's then she is ugly and wants go back to be perfect and to the usual stereotypes. Also let's include fat barbie and paralytic barbie but for some reason let's not include fat Ken or paralytic Ken and just make them all gorgeous and fit, clearly not body-shaming guys...<br><br>If you are wondering why I haven't spoken about any of the plot, well... that's because there isn't one besides vibes and ideologies.<br><br>I was also surprised in the good way for not having woke characters or members of the lgbtqi+ comunity. If there is a movie for it, it's this one but I'm glad they did not force any of that.<br><br>It's sad to see that almost all the audience just went there to show off their pink outfits, tell everyone they have watched the movie by taking pics before or after the movie and to stay on their phones instead of watching it. I came out of the movie worried about where society is going and I think that was not supposed to happen.",7

It's so cleverly done. Margo Robbie is stunning and brilliant as Barbie. Ryan Gosling was the right pick for Ken. He has that cheeky charm and vulnerability down to a tee. He is such a great performer and dancer. If you ever had a Barbie this will bring back memories. It's got it's political undertones and it's trying to get a message across.

" Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life
","Barbie is a story of a Barbie gaining sentience when her owner hits a bad time affecting her life in BarbieLand. She develops human feelings and tries to come to term with it by meeting her humans whilst forced to string along her Ken. Ken sees the real world, he finds more things that can be of his benefit, MEANWHILE Barbie falls into much deeper bad time. Ruckus happens as the Mattel Company AND Barbie tries to make thing back to what it is used to be AND BECOMES A DASH before things go to late.<br><br>A very well conceptualized film about Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life. I think this is a great idea BUT clearly there are things that can be better.<br><br>Loved mostly its darker and dramatic moments. Gerwig wrestling the ideas of Barbie both in the Feminist context and the how the public sees it at large was a masterclass. It is where the story really held its landing. YOU could see how Barbie both as an idea and a product, comes to term of how she affected the culture or just how the culture at large move ahead from it. The scene with Ruth and Barbie is so well placed in the script.<br><br>But for the mixed parts of the film, I felt more mixed with the comedic aspect of the film. The script was fun but verbally the schtick can be quite repetitive. It also was not that witty AND pass quirkiness as such. It was not. Visually, its funnier though but a lot of the jokes can be a hit or miss. I do not think Gerwig understood HOW TO END it with the Ken's BUT practically its her nodding the first wave Feminist, by them maybe trying to get the fundamental rights first before going all out but without any repercussion for the Ken Movement.<br><br>I also did not like how anti-climactic the Un-Kendollification of the Barbie's was. The grand standing gesture was just repeated too much, that it kinda loses a lot of its power but I guess it was to make sense of the plans for the Ken's afterward.<br><br>Acting wise definitely, I think Gosling did the best with the comedic material, with Robbie excelling in more dramatic portion of the film. Not as impressed with the others except maybe for McKinnon's weird Barbie and Issa Rae as President Barbie, which both has moments but too small to really be noteworthy.<br><br>I think it is definitely overhyped AND was meant for children BUT Gerwig did great with all the hoopla she had faced to make this film, especially with its themes of Female Identity AND Barbie herself, the portion of the film I think it had its best success. Robbie deserves the accolades as she brings to life Barbie. Gosling was also good as the very much confused Ken. 3.5/5.",7
" A Glamourous but Poorly Executed Product
","In Barbieland, Stereotypical Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, experiences changes both mentally and physically, much to the surprise of the other Barbies. To find the answers she is looking for, Stereotypical Barbie must venture out into the real world, accompanied by her Ken, played by Ryan Gosling. On the plus side, the production design is striking. Barbieland is visually interesting, managing to feel fake, but lived in at the same time. The actors seem to have fun in the roles they are playing, Ryan Gosling's Ken being a stand out, making the best of the material he has. Margot Robbie also fulfills the role at playing a believable Barbie. Unfortunately, the overall execution of the film was disappointing. Most of the humor didn't land for me, though it did have its moments. Then there is the mixed messaging regarding gender roles. The film clearly states what it is trying to say (not subtle at all), but at the same time, undermines it through poor writing and characterization. Likewise, other attempts for the story to get deep end up falling flat by getting in its own way. While Barbie has its moments, it ends up getting held back by poorly executed ideas. Final verdict: 5/10.",5
" Mattel's love letter to their Creation?
","This film had to be more than advertising Mattel's famous doll, which set the standard for playthings fifty-odd years ago. And getting Greta Gerwig to direct a movie about Barbie, seems to have been a creative masterstroke. As expected, she has delivered a stylish incarnation of the sometimes much-derided doll, and it's a fun movie that carries its serious message quite lightly.<br><br>It looks spectacular, with Barbieland depicted with so much pink it could be nauseating, but the camera is moved around very skilfully so that images are fleeting. With most of the characters being Ken or Barbie, it is easy to follow, and the audience knows that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are the pair to follow.<br><br>The plot is simple enough, with Barbie suffering a trauma that causes her to visit the real world where some shattering illusions cause her to rethink her role as a female icon. Robbie is stunning in this role, she has always shone in playing over the top characters, and Barbie has given her plenty of scope for this. She is matched by a superb Ryan Gosling, clearly enjoying playing a downtrodden male who gets a chance to avenge his status, and the rest of the cast are all good as well, particularly America Ferrera as a Mattel employee who sees through the Barbie dream, and Will Ferrell, being the usual Will Ferrell as the boss of Mattel.<br><br>I really enjoyed the film, but the second part was somewhat overlong. Gerwig also couldn't resist getting into a preachy mode as the ending approached. I docked two stars for that, but otherwise this film was the tonic the film industry needed. There have been too many mediocre films lately, this isn't one of them.",8
" Pink Rose of Cairo
","The absolute best thing about this movie, is that it drives *exactly* the right people up a wall. In truth, it is neither as frivolous as it outwardly appears, nor nearly as socially progressive as it wants to be. And it's certainly not as clever as it thinks it is. Supporting characters played by Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell are basic, and frankly unnecessary. As for the humor, only a few lines land. ""I'm a man without power, does that make me a woman?"" was one of the few. The 2001 opening was cute. The railway joke I'd seen on social media, and thought that was good, but in the film it just felt like they were trying a little *too* hard to be clever. I appreciate it, but I just don't feel they committed enough to that tack.<br><br>On the plus side, there's never going to be a time when watching Margot Robbie is going to be a chore. She is wonderfully charming, and does a great job making the character and film work as much as it does. America Ferrera also does a great job, and has the only real scene of strident messaging to bother (those people who try hard to be bothered by such things). But, that is the point-of-view of the film, and what the filmmakers wants to portray. More power to them.<br><br>As for the ""plot' such as it is, it's really just another fish-out-of-water, or even, body-switch trope, with the added metaphysical dimension of reality vs. Fantasy. Which is what put me in mind of Purple Rose of Cairo. A film with a broader, less directed, female empowerment message, but a similar contrast of harsh reality and idealized fantasy. Pink Rose of Cairo.",7
" Great movie
","For sure would be better rated if there weren't so many insecure men missing the entire point of the movie, or rejecting it because it is not the same old narrative that has favoured only them until now. I don't think is ""too preachy"" as other comments say. Is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day. Even ignoring the message, it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows, had great music, good acting, creativity, good visuals, all in all great movie. I like that it didn't have a typical love story ending, which would have ruined the whole point of the movie. A fresh movie that is needed.",10
" A Barbie world
","Another movie based on a famous toy, now based on Barbie dolls from the toy company Mattel; I do not love Barbie toys, but I do not hate them either. The movie Barbie (2023) was surprisingly good with it being funny and having a good message; other than the interesting premise to the movie, there is great casting with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. Another draw to this movie for me other than the premise and the casting, was the design and the look of the movie looking like a Barbie playset with the look of Barbieland and the amount of pink and the use of life-sized plastic props used like in Barbie toy sets.<br><br>I could not think of anyone else to play the role of the main Barbie other than Margot Robbie, because she is great in the role with Barbie having an existential crisis about herself, and herself changing like her feet being flat on the ground instead of on tippy toes; she was funny and likable with her trying to find what human is playing with her doll in the real world. Ryan Gosling as Ken was funny to watch being obsessed with the beach, wanting Barbie and him to be more than friends, and discovering things men do in the real world and bringing this stuff to Barbieland; tagging along with Barbie on her journey to the real-world helping Barbie with her problem while also learning new things himself.<br><br>The rest of the cast of the movie are playing a bunch of diverse kinds of Barbies and Kens involving Weird Barbie played by Kate McKinnon, and there being one Allan played by Michael Cera who is also funny with the rest of the cast that involves how Barbieland works and how their characters interact off each other. The movie has a fictional version of the toy company Mattel with Will Ferrell as the Mattel CEO who is funny, but sometimes some of the scenes at Mattel in the movie were not that funny, even though the way they make fun of Mattel can be funny to watch. There is no real antagonist for this movie, unless you want to count Mattel in the movie, but they are not in the movie as much as they could be, so it focuses on Barbie's self-journey on her existence and how the world works.<br><br>The world of Barbieland does look amazing with the Barbies having dream houses that look like the toy sets with plastic props and sound effects that makes it look like the Barbies are doing things in their lives, and them occasionally moving around like they are being played with. Everything in Barbieland looks like life sized versions of the toys with water being plastic and the vehicles moving like toy cars, I especially like how Barbieland is connected to the real world as explained by Helen Mirren as the Narrator in the beginning of the movie. Plus, I like how they talk about how the Barbie doll in the real world affects the real Barbies in Barbieland, while also talking about the discontinued/cancelled Barbies and Kens in both worlds.<br><br>The movie Barbie (2023) was funny, weird, creative, emotionally investing at times, and entertaining/fun to watch; the acting from the whole cast is great, Barbieland looks great, the songs in the movie are catchy, and there is a good message in the movie going around involving Barbie thinking Barbies changed things in the real world with equal rights and stuff like that. An issue would be that it puts its message in your face too much at certain points, but by the second and third act the movie goes a different direction than what I was expecting, and I was laughing a lot. People who love the Barbie toys will like this movie, people who are in the middle with Barbie like me will like it, and the people who do not like the Barbie toys might get some enjoyment out of this film because the movie says both good and not good things about the toys making fun of them which makes this movie entertaining to watch.",7
" Barbie Review
","Released: 21st July 2023 (UK)<br><br>Certificate: 12A<br><br>Director: Greta Gerwig<br><br>Loved by critics and the average movie goers. Film buffs like my myself will love it or hate it like marmite. Myself I'm gonna put it in my guilty pleasure list of films. I'm so glad Greta Gerwig is becoming recognised as a film director and writer because one of her previous films Lady Bird was outstanding. She is also known for acting in a great horror film Ti West's The House of the Devil and the brilliant Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs.<br><br>The film was very entertaining with its hidden adult jokes and how glamorous the world of Barbie is to look at. The soundtrack will become very memorable that will eventually linger with you after the film has ended. Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is the perfect choice, but for me I think Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show more for me. Either way I loved them both! I think they both lead the film perfectly. It was great seeing Micheal Cera again after going under the radar for a while. I remember he was becoming a rising up actor in my college years in films like Superbad and Juno. Also it was great seeing Will Ferrell and Kate McKinnon being crazy as ever. I loved the little cameos from John Cena as Mermaid Ken and Rob Brydon as Suger Daddy Ken. Let's not forget Helen Mirren as the sassy narrator. It was really sweet seeing Rhea Perlman again too. She was great in 1996's version of Matilda as the very wacky mother.<br><br>How fun the film is it does suffer from originality. The idea behind it has been done to death in films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Last Action Hero and Space Jam. Where I said it's like marmite is because there were moments that I felt like it was a bit strong on the political messages and mental health on today's society; if you are looking to watch a film for some escapism where in my opinion that's what the magic of movie experience is all about. Other than that the film is well paced with its decent runtime.",8
" Well made but hypocritical
","The movie is very well produced in terms of art. The costumes are beautiful, such as the scenarios. When it comes to give us the impression of a ""toy world"", I give them a 10. Everything was very well thought out. The music scenes were also really good.<br><br>However, the story is weak. It is kind of a cliche, to be honest: you have a good start, you face a problem, you can't solve it at first, but with your friends help everything is figured out and ends fine. Will Ferrell whole participation, for example, is so... Strange. It seems like he is going to be an important part of the film, but suddenly he and his crew disappear and only return in the end of the movie for a, again, end cliche.<br><br>Also, they try to force on, like, ""We are so deconstructed, open-heart, unmaterialistic, look how the world is sexist, look how women are underprivileged, look how Mattel is toxic"", but at the same time they are contributing for everything they are, supposedly, criticizing since they work for Hollywood and they have a contract with Mattel.<br><br>Barbie was not in the news for a long time. Don't you think Mattel is going to sell new dolls like never before after this movie?<br><br>It's something like ""I'm criticizing you while working for you, so this will promote us, give us money, since my bad comments throughout the movie won't harm you at all"".",6
" BAD
","I am just amazed how many good actors and actresses agreed to be<br><br>in such a movie!!!! It's neither for kids nor for adults...its a movie with<br><br>no identity..rubbish at its best.<br><br>Whatever msg it is meant to send , is lost in the bad flick.....i wouldn't<br><br>even dare call it a movie.....wasted time .<br><br>The names of the cast and the name of the flick promised so much<br><br>and delivered nil.<br><br>Too bad that the most famous doll of all time be in such a flop.<br><br>Watching the preview was the reason i went to see it . All the brilliant
colors reminded me of movies of the golden era of the 50s...Extremely Disappointed.",1
" 8,5/10
","No movie I've seen lately has made me feel this happy. I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an ordinary romantic comedy, but as I watched the movie I started to think about what popular culture has done to people. The costumes are exquisite. The location designs are incredible. Makeup and jewelry design is perfect. And the acting is so natural that it draws you into the movie. A movie for the summer months. You feel incredibly happy when you leave the movie and go home. You are in a fairy tale world but you are facing the harshest realities of the world. I thank everyone who contributed. I hope that the interest in the movie will not lead to a repeat of the mistakes that have been made many times before and a second Barbie movie will not be made.",8
" Barbie and the meaning of life
","Barbie is a story of a Barbie gaining sentience when her owner hits a bad time affecting her life in BarbieLand. She develops human feelings and tries to come to term with it by meeting her humans whilst forced to string along her Ken. Ken sees the real world, he to finds more things that can be of his benefit, WHILE Barbie falls into much deeper bad time. Ruckus happens as the Mattel Company AND Barbie tries to make thing back to what it is used to be.<br><br>A very well conceptualized film about Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life. I think this is a great idea BUT clearly there are things that can be better.<br><br>Loved mostly its darker and dramatic moments. Gerwig wrestling the ideas of Barbie both in the Feminist context and the how the public sees it at large was a masterclass. It is where the story really held its landing. YOU could see how Barbie both as an idea and a product, comes to term of how she affected the culture or just how the culture at large move ahead. The scene with Ruth and Barbie is so well placed in the script.<br><br>But for the mixed parts of the film, I felt more mixed with the comedic aspect of the film. The script was fun but verbally the schtick can be quite repetitive. It also was not that witty at times AND pass quirkiness as such. It was not. Visually, its funnier though but a lot of the jokes can be a hit or miss. I do not think Gerwig understood HOW TO END it with the Ken's BUT practically its her nodding the first wave Feminist, by them maybe trying to get the fundamental rights first before going all out but without any repurcussion for the Ken Movement.<br><br>I also did not like how anti-climactic the Un-Kendollification of the Barbie's was. The grand standing gesture was just repeated too much, that it kinda loses a lot of its power but I guess it was to make sense of the plans for the Ken's afterward.<br><br>Acting wise definitely, I think Gosling did the best with the comedic material, with Robbie excelling in more dramatic portion of the film. Not as impressed with the others except maybe for McKinnon's weird Barbie and Issa Rae as President Barbie, which both has moments but too small to really be noteworthy.<br><br>I think it is definitely overhyped AND was meant for children BUT Gerwig did great with all the hoopla she had faced to make this film, especially with its themes of Female Identity AND Barbie herself, the portion of the film I think it had its best success. Robbie deserves the accolades as she brings to life Barbie. Gosling was also good as the very much confused Ken. 3.5/5.",7
" Just a Kitsch...
","Barbie movie was very under my expectations.<br><br>The movie per total was a kitsch... from beggining to the end.<br><br>I expected a more interesting story, perhaps with some decent lines of comedy.<br><br>The regisor didn't had a vision, she just hurry up to create a piece of something, just to be there in cinemas to gather money.<br><br>The regisor just took advantage of the big name and popularity of Barbie toy.<br><br>Mains actors were blunt. No emotions, superficiality<br><br>The morala: Humans have just one ending..
What we all have to remember from this movie, is that all humans have just one ending... Death. - A curse from our ""Loving Creator""",3
" I feel so seen- and that's what Barbie is!
","I continuously laughed and cried the whole movie. The acting is impeccable. There are so many small details and visual gags that I'm sure there were things I missed because I was laughing so much. It's clear the writers are intimately familiar with doll play, and how Barbies are actually used by children.<br><br>Special shout-out to America Ferrara in this respect. Obviously Robbie and Gosling are amazing, but Ferrera brings the ""human woman"" perspective with enthusiasm and warmth. Her delivery for certain monologues is achingly relatable, and acknowledges issues facing both women and Barbie in a way that validates what women may or may not feel without judgement, just camaraderie.<br><br>The movie is self aware, the auteur lens making it feel like you're watching alongside someone. I cannot imagine watching the movie and feeling alone- Greta gerwig has brought you into the fold, acknowledging your role as audience but also as witness.<br><br>This is most apparent in the scenes of the movie that other reviewers have deemed feminist. The whole point of Barbie (the movie and the doll's origins) are to make women feel seen, feel valued and to show that you can be you without collecting things to validate your identity.<br><br>I absolutely loved every minute of this film and I am so happy that it was made. Thank you to everyone involved in this project, you truly created movie magic.<br><br>I am unsurprised that there are negative reviews for this movie, as some people do not enjoy looking at the truth head on. Suspend any need for Complacent Barbie, and embrace the wonderful magic of this movie.<br><br>(barely a spoiler) the second to the last scene of Barbie made me feel the way I did when watching Lovecraft Country, episode 7 (titled ""I am."") if you need a dose of that energy before you can see the movie again, I absolutely recommend it. No need to watch the whole series if it's not your bag.",10
" The name is what brings people in....
","6.7/10<br><br>Well, that went as well I imagined it would. There's nothing crazy or fantastical about this movie. I laughed a few times. I tried to go in with an open mind despite the gripes about the film.<br><br>Firstly, this part is not meant to be deep. Just what I observed on a surface perspective. The message. This is probably the biggest gripe people have had from what I've seen. It's been done before, and better, only this time Barbie is the face. My conclusion was that both Barbie and need to find who they are in this crazy world. They need to do it in a way that doesn't put the other down, or alienate the other into believing they are or aren't good enough to accomplish something.<br><br>Margot Robbie continues to be one of my favourite actresses. She did a splendid job as Barbie. Ryan Gosling as Ken is where things got iffy for me. He made it work, but I think his success comes with Simu Liu as his opposite. Without Simu Liu, Gosling (ten years older than me) is just the awkward old guy trying to maintain his youth.<br><br>Visually the film was great. It felt like a world of make believe, and plastic. The graphics used to create certain scenes worked well, and didn't feel more fake than what they were meant to be. I actually loved the soundtrack for the film. Some really good songs, and while it's put in as a remix, it was nice that ""Barbie Girl"" made the cut. The pacing is steady and the two hours runtime flew by.<br><br>Overall, an enjoyable and entertaining film. I would say it's worth checking out. Definitely, and obviously, geared towards women more so. Acting, cinematography, and sound are all good. I am convinced however that if Barbie was not the face. This film would not have made $1bn. Cause it's definitely not that good.<br><br>That's all for now. Thank you for reading my review, and until next time.... Enjoy the show!",6
" weakness to strength
","Greta Gerwig Director of Little women and Lady bird did a great job directing movie Barbie. I did not own or play with barbie dolls. Made the whole concept of Barbie very enjoyable and motivational for women in general .Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie, beautiful in appearance, perky by nature. After stepping into reality , Barbie meets strong women ..different Barbie.. There is a Barbie with different labels... women in all fields. Conventional ordinary Barbie is not ordinary anymore. The movie is 1hr 54 minutes. In the beginning it is all about beautiful Barbie and then a beautiful twist to the story with planet earth having Barbie in all aspects and professions of life. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken ( excellent lovable Ryan Gosling) wanting Barbie and seeking for conventional Barbie in now matured Barbie Margot Robbie. Fun, great movie with lots of lessons for empowering women and teaching little girls to step out of beautiful fake kitchens and playhouses and feeding dolls. New dimension to womanhood is beautifully embedded in impressionable brains of little girls and teenagers rushing in pink clothes to feel like Barbie. Great job , Greta Gerwig. Adorable perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie who steps out of conventional type cast beauty. Excellent ensemble.",10
" Fun and not overly complicated
","I know there's been concern that the movie will be overly feminist because it was written by Greta Grewig. This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.<br><br>I think the movie would've worked better as a tv series to allow the writers to flesh out the characters a bit more. It would've been better if we understood more of what created the distance between Gloria and her daughter (See? I can't even remember her name). When did Barbie first start feeling that she wanted more than the same existence everyday. Why weren't the Barbies and Kens capable of understanding more than their world? Didn't their characters encompass their human counterparts?<br><br>Anyway....the movie was fun, lighthearted and something for everyone to enjoy.",7
" Fun and Touching Story of Womanhood
","From the opening scene, Barbie knows exactly what movie she is and what she has to say. Everything from the legacy of Barbie as a brand to the mass misunderstanding of her purpose are all handled eloquently and addressed in such a light way it keeps the movie on track without becoming a thinkpiece.<br><br>The shortage of pink paint that followed this movie completely makes sense once you step inside the bright world of Barbie's dream house. What follows the __funny__ Space Odyssey recreation opening scene is a humorous but touching commentary on the journey of womanhood. Hilarious from start to finish, but will likely jump up some tears at the relatability.<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling could not have been replaced by anyone else in this film; they run this film flawlessly. The Oscar-buzz surrounding Gosling's performance of Ken is not out of nowhere. Unlike any other role he's played before, it showcases his range in the comedy arena as well as giving him the opportunity to exemplify his showman qualities in a new genre. Robbie is the perfect mix of peppy, smart and sensitive to be Stereotypical Barbie and always has us rooting for her.<br><br>The soundtrack is immaculate and lends to the overall experience of the Barbie world while blending it with the real world by featuring so many popular artists. The bubbly vibe and fun attitude of the movie paints a great background while clearing up the mixed messaging about what Barbie was made for and the intended impact of her invention for better and for worse.<br><br>Strongly recommended for everyone; bring tissues!",9
" Margot Robbie Is Barbie
","This is a fun, clever film that does about as much with its premise as it possibly could. Margot Robbie is cast as a doll with a reputation for an unrealistic body type. Finding a way to make a doll not only human but relatable and compelling enough to anchor a feature film is a daunting challenge, but somehow Robbie does just that while also managing to look the part. Appropriately, the art direction is playful. For all the inventiveness of this film, its concept occasionally leaves its screenplay unfocused.<br><br>In her live-action, big-screen debut, Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.",7
" Like reading a textbook instead of a novel
","Making a Barbie movie about feminism is a cool idea. Having Barbie comment on the patriarchy just like Animal Farm about communism and Wall Street about capitalism. It's admirable and the message gets through.<br><br>The problem is that the actual movie is so bad. Even though you buy in on the two worlds, etc, etc. In the end, it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel. Normally, the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels. Here, everything is spelled out from a a teacher's desk and the whole film comes across as bit thin.<br><br>I would not watch this movie again.",4
" Simple message beautifully told
","I enjoyed this film very much even if I didn't learn anything new - because I'm old enough. But I would love it if I gad some movie like this to watch during my teenage days.<br><br>Direction was impeccable, cast amazingly well chosen, scenography immaculate, as well as makeup and costume. Storytelling was absolutely superb.<br><br>Serious issues were told in a very innovative manner and philosophically it is highly important film because of all the antagonisms. It doesn't offer a solution, and with an excellent reason - the answers are in each of us.<br><br>Absolutely brilliant work and I would watch it again many times. (In contrast to Oppenheimer which was biggest bore of all the time)<br><br>This comes from a person who never liked playing with Barbie(s).",8
" Barbie is fun!
","As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast. Yes the plot is thin, yes it's a little bare bones and yes there's some minor pacing things here and there. But for what it is I liked this movie a lot. I will be watching again on streaming!",7
" Not for little girls. Not for anyone actually.
","What could have been a cute concept was overproduced with obvious writer infighting pulling this disaster into all directions. A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with ""Good Boys"". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn't waste any money.",3
" Hi Barbie !
","Honestly Barbie turned out to be a pretty good film, the concept was already a good one and the execution was really good. The movie did feel a bit long though, a few scenes that felt dragged out. I like the mother and daughter, they were like the audience's soul within the movie.<br><br>The quote where mothers stand still to show their daughters how far they've gone/made it was really beautiful, my mother cried during that scene.<br><br>Ryan Gosling shined a lot during this film and I liked that since he represented men. (In a way) opinion.<br><br>Overall really super enjoyable movie for all ages. More so for the adults in my opinion, great message for the Barbies and the Kens of our real world.",9
" Barbie is awesome
","Let's just get it out of the way, I freaking love Barbie. So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about. The iconography, the looks, Ken (~swoon~)... there was one problem though, I am a boy, I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one. Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared, perhaps she went into Barbieland? Greta Gerwig's movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven't seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.<br><br>Barbie is a movie that is about Barbie, the doll, the idea, living in a world separate from reality called Barbieland a world where Barbie is everything, from the president to a Nobel prize laureate to a doctor. She runs this world in all her iterations, until the stereotypical Barbie somehow gets thoughts about death, she gets a flat foot (CHAOS!) and she gets cellulites (THE HORROR!)- she has to fix this by travelling in the real world with Ken and in this she meets a hard working mother and her cynical daughter- fun hijinks galore!<br><br>This movie has got the aesthetics DOWN, like it's so pretty and so meticulously done with all the details, to how the actors act and how the worlds are built- this is more on how the Barbie world is, because when it mixes with the real world. That's where things get a bit complicated.<br><br>Example; There's no actual ""real"" separation between Barbieland or the real world, meaning that the real world feels like a mirror flipped version of Barbieland where people act just as outlandish as the titular dolls. I kinda wish that Greta would've made a script that actually puts Barbie in real world, how it is right now, and I know that Greta is great at making reality feel relatable and recognisable and human but I felt there was not much of a difference. Maybe it was so that they could fill the whole Mattel-company storyline in it? Either way I wish that Greta would play more with these contrasts and fish-out-of-water-feelings.<br><br>This in turn makes the other characters that should be relatable for the moviegoers- i.e. The daughter and the mother feel painfully flat and just unnecessary for the story overall, despite making them ""deep"" they felt honestly super flat, like dolls and stereotypes of characters in a movie. And I don't think that was Greta's intention, not if you see the movies that she's done before where there's always a singular perspective but here I think she's kind of confused on who to use the perspective the most on. Luckily it is Barbie and Ken for the most of the movie, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are doing a fantastic job at playing these characters and it's in their moments where the comedy shines the most.<br><br>Another missed opportunity generally I think is just addressing the gay history that is tied to the Barbie brand. And how gay men like me were influenced by it- not to say that this was absolutely important for a movie like this but I still feel like it would've made sense, at least the gay doll of 90s Ken (who was made popular in the 90s due to being bought by mostly gay men) made an appearance, if only briefly. I know, I shouldn't make demands about this but I feel like there would've been something even more interesting with addressing all the boys that play with Barbie dolls, the ""real world"" feels very black and white in this sense. But I regress, this is just a tangent and a thought!<br><br>I love the comedic and camp elements, I think they are what sustain the movie and the fashion of course. Also I love that it brings forth the themes of feminism as that is needed in a movie like this, I think that it does so in a great manner. Is it the movie that I wanted? Not really, but I'm glad that it exists, I'm glad that I saw it. Maybe I was too much swayed by the whole PR marketing strategy but I really wanted this to be a new camp and fun fun classic. Instead it feels just good and that's ok. I wanted it to be more of an adult-oriented movie and maybe that's where Greta kind of flubbed it, trying to make it both kid and adult friendly but she honestly doesn't succeed at neither and that's alright.",7

First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads. Loved the light this movie shed.",10
" The barbie car needs a turbo
","Didnt know what to expect going in, but was surprised at how good it was.<br><br>The films entire premise is to shatter the 4th wall, both with its story and literally, just shattering it whenever it wants. With the message that what you see onscreen is just that, and not an actual representation of reality.<br><br>This is incredibly well done..for the most part. Great all around acting from the entire cast, lizzo &amp; ice spice will never be talented, in anything, ever, please pipe down.<br><br>Margot Robbie was an excellent ironic choice, as she is an actual IRL barbie.<br><br>Will ferrell and the other comedy is quite funny, plus ryan gosling is just one cool guy.<br><br>Barbie also beat Oppenheimer to the streams, and doesnt go for 3hrs.",7
" Bafflingly mediocre
","I have been thinking for 2 days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is. The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbieland the movie just completely falls apart. The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.<br><br>For a movie I was incredibly excited for, I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone. If you are going to only see one blockbuster this summer, make it Mission Impossible or Oppenheimer, you are not missing out on much here.",4
" Very intelligent movie with message
","So I watched this movie a few days ago and I think it is one of the most intelligent movies I have ever watched. From the first time I watched the trailer I knew this movie would be different I knew it wouldn't be just about a doll and it would have something more. And I was correct. These movie is about existational crisis, finding who you are and your purpose.<br><br>And they do that amazingly good. In the end you just understand the character and you touched by her story. I cry at the end and I didn't expect that at all. In the end she just discovers that she doesn't need to be Barbie, she can be whoever she wants, this beautiful. How many times you're just leaving our lives thinking we can't be just more than what we already are.<br><br>Everyone should give a chance to this movie.",10
" Could be better
",Started well including the scene where Barbie removes her feet from her shoes and remains the same shape (as per the trailer) but after Barbie and the characters were introduced the script began to lose its way. As though the writer tried to include little memories or what would be nice rather than a theme or good story throughout. If you have nothing to do worth watching but if you are expecting laughs or a wow factor don't expect too much. I think also instead of directing to children and adults just stick to one or other. Actors were all good but the story just let them down. Hopefully not a trilogy on the way.,6
" Not family friendly or really enjoyable
","I expected this movie to be more lighthearted and it had heavy themes and material. The first half hour or so was ok and had some funny moments but the second half just wasn't enjoyable to me. The writing was not good story telling and felt more like a number of speeches. I found it hard to watch honestly.<br><br>There was a lot of overt messaging that I feel was not suitable for this movie. I didn't appreciate the depiction of the relationship between Ken and Barbie or the situation created for them. The acting, some musical numbers and sets were good but overall a missed opportunity to make a fun feel-good movie. I was very disappointed.",3
" Makes me question my entire worldview
","I can't believe it. Humans have made a good movie. How is this metaphysically possible? Isn't badness defined as the quality uniting things that humans love?<br><br>Let's start from the beginning to see where I got it wrong. In the beginning, the good God creates the universe. Ialdabaoth then creates humans in his image. Humans then excrete the civilization they love today. But somewhere in the middle of that rancid dumpster fire, there's a good movie created to sell dolls to little girls.<br><br>This can mean only one thing. We were wrong when we thought intelligence is the solution to our problems. Maybe we should lobotomize the geniuses and start over.",10
" Barbie's breathtaking visuals and practical effects outshine the erratic storytelling to make a fresh and innovative movie with themes that will be divisive for many.
","Barbie is a visually stunning achievement that has excelled at the box office while dividing audiences. On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.",7
" Seriously campy fun!
","I must admit, growing up I've had complicated feelings toward Barbie. In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.<br><br>This movie is exactly what I would want from a Barbie movie. It's extremely campy throughout, but also recognizes that life is very much complicated. It's not easy being an adult woman or man. Do you want to laugh? Watch this movie. Do want to feel seen and have one of those cathartic cries? Then go and watch this movie!",10
" I didn't get what I came here to see, but I still had a blast the whole way through. 7.5/10
","Barbie sets herself to go to the real world to solve her flat feet and cellulite by connecting with the girl that played with her.<br><br>Entering Barbieland is breathtaking. It's built exactly like a child's imagination with incredible set designs and quirky mechanics. The first thirty minutes are fun and filled with music and bright colours. The dance sequences brings me back to my childhood where I would create these kinds of scenes with my toys. I wish we could have stayed in this wonderland a bit longer before we had to get to the real world.<br><br>Ryan Gossling stole the show. I don't remember the last time I laughed so much. It was iconic how Gerwig reversed the narrative and made Ken into the typical representation of women in film. The film is so clever and is clearly made by someone that is a student of film. With references of Space Odessey, the Matrix, The Truman Show, The Wizard of Oz, and hundreds of others, it made the film have that much more depth.<br><br>I feel like the plot could have been rearranged a bit. The quests Barbie is supposed to solve seems irrelevant to me. It offers comic relief, but I believe it would have been more pertinent to have her explore the real world to see how Barbies ""saved"" us. The mom and daughter character are useless to the narrative. Other than having 0 personality or depth, we never got to understand their tension or learn their drives. They could have been better written, or removed all together. The monologue sequence was a mistake. Show me how women live in this world instead of telling me. It sounded too preachy for me, despite me being a feminist. If we would have spent less time on the mother and daughter, and more on giving concrete examples of women's pressure, it would have been a stronger film.<br><br>The story and characterization is also lacking at Mattel. We never get a conclusion to why Mattel went back to Barbieland. The story felt incomplete, and perhaps overly cut due to corporate producers. This brings me to argue that we didn't receive the movie that was intended by the director. Although it being a critique on our society and the impossible standards for women, it could have been pushed even further. Perhaps the large presence of corporate players like Mattel and Chevrolet hindered the extent of the satire. I was expecting a Kubrick kind of satire, and as much as we did get some of that, more subtle satire could have been beneficial. I have full confidence in Gerwig's skills which is why I'd be curious to see a directors cut. Let's petition for it!<br><br>The ending was also disappointing for me. I felt like I was watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 for no apparent reason. Perhaps they didn't really know where to go with the story and I'm shocked they chose that. I liked that we got to meet the creator of Barbie, but there was something missing for me. Overall, this was a fun time. I think most audiences will enjoy this despite having some plot holes. I look forward to watching it again in the future.",7
" Whacky and Wonderful but a little bit preachy
","I loved so much about this movie. From the costumes to the sets to the colors to the soundtrack to the excellent comedy. I also really loved the plot and takeaway of the film.<br><br>With that said, as someone who believes deeply in the message, it was a little bit too preachy. It laid the message on very thick. And I get it; it's an important and very real topic that has a massive amount of cultural relevance. But we have to give the audience some credit that we can get the idea without the repetition.<br><br>That doesn't detract from what a fun yet emotional movie this is. Ryan and Margot are amazing, as are all the supporting cast members. It's a movie worthy of the massive craze, for sure.",8
" Fun, but it will get old soon
","This movie was a lot of fun to watch. Everybody focuses on Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who were obviously great), but I think America Ferrera and Will Ferrell also gave solid performances.<br><br>I think both set design and wardrobe did an amazing job. There were so many fun little details and overall they nailed the mood this movie needed.<br><br>What I did not like are these cringe songs. I would have left those out entirely. Also, towards the end, there was a part (a dialog), which felt really forced to me. At that point even the cinematography was terrible.<br><br>We will talk about this movie for years, but most of it will be due to its clever marketing campaign, and Barbenheimer memes. However, it is not something I will re-watch in the near future. I'd even go as far as to say it's a one-time watch.",6
" Should've been great, but is forced, not subtle or clever, and constantly repeats the same messages non-stop.
","What a damn shame. A PG-13 Barbie movie from Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, intended for those who loved and hated Barbie. I was looking forward to seeing Barbie. However, even those who hated Barbie would not call her fascist. This film borrows from so many films, The Truman Show, The Lego Movie, Legally Blonde, Toy Story 1-3, Singing In The Rain, Born Yesterday, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, and so many more. Other films which I could not help but recall how they got it right, where this film did not.<br><br>Barbie is more than a film about iconic dolls coming to life. Filled with a lot of heavy messages, all of which are hard not to miss, and all of which are very forcefully delivered...repetitively. A week ago, I saw Oppenheimer. Had it been on the same level as Barbie, we would've been hearing the words, ""Nukes are bad"" over and over and over throughout the whole film. Yes, it would've been an extremely annoying experience. We, the audience, know nukes are beyond bad. The film gave its audience the respect in knowing this. Barbie, holds nothing back in constantly spelling out the same messages for its audiences. Did they seriously think the audience would not get any of these directly stated messages? Barbie has little faith in its audience and treats us like....dolls. In fact, Oppenheimer is over an hour longer and yet Barbue felt longer.<br><br>I do agree with several of the points the film makes, but it's not done in a clever or impacting way. Not just in one or two scenes, but in dozens. One of the biggest messages is feminism and inequality, to which I agree with many points the film, not so subtly makes. However, most of the arguments can be said for both sexes.<br><br>The film aims to be a battle of the sexes, but instead ends up less of a battle between men and women and more between privileged middle class and d-bags.<br><br>There was a little enjoyment with Barbie. Margot Robbie and especially Ryan Gosling both look like they're having a blast with their characters. The production design of Barbieworld is wonderful. There were some laughs scattered throughout, about 1 in every 4th joke. Gerwig did a fine job directing this, but the script ultimately brought the film down.<br><br>One other thing which ruined the experience for me was the audience. The 9pm audience on a Monday night of a nearly sold out show would not stop talking, or giggling during scenes which were dramatic and not comedy. One of the movie's best scene between Barbie and her creator which is a somber moment, had girls giggling left and right. Barbie was one of the worst theater experiences for me and my wife, who said it was the worst theater experience she's ever had, and even though she liked the film the audience around us ruined her enjoyment. Will say, at least Barbie was better than The Dial of Destiny.",5
" So Much Fun
","I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig's outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.<br><br>Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.<br><br>For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing ""Barbs"" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma's were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say,
thank you.",10
" OK
","The movie is okay if you wanna have a laugh and entertainment.<br><br>The script is a bit weird but it has it point.<br><br>Goslint and Margot are so good in their characters.<br><br>The first 45 are a bit intensive and laughable. But ""the second half"" are enjoyable with a fun and more realistic view.<br><br>Barbie shows and tells the hard lite of a woken in the real world but also the hard world of Ken in the barbie world.<br><br>The moviemaker takes up the life of barbies that our childhood was obsessed with. Clothes,cars,houses and characters in a perfect way.<br><br>The movie has a cirkus plot and a bit raily but in the end it is OK.",6
" Life is plastic!
","Firstly, let's start with what was good about Barbie and move forward from there. The colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. Barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. What it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. In the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.<br><br>This silly satire soon finds itself covering too much ground about how the world of Barbie is female dominant, alongside how the real world is male dominant. It evolves into a feminist movement film that is a little dated, then slowly back peddles and suggests everyone should be who they want to be. That all you have to do is find out who you are and what your purpose is. It almost becomes lost within its own thought pattern without really conveying anything meaningful. It feels like a load of thoughts with no conclusion or that somebody has thrown a pad of post-it notes in the air. The musical tone and lighthearted comedy that seemed set to propel this movie into box office glory, felt neglected to some extent, when real world themes were contemplated. What was working at first will slowly devour with over dramatic speeches of everything that is wrong with a male dominated world. As well as other complaints about having so much on your plate and being too god damn tired.<br><br>Barbie finds herself wanting to leave Barbieland to feel real emotions rather than go through day to day life like everything is perfect. The cross-over between worlds worked to some degree, to me it was showing the girl leaving behind her dolls and becoming a woman to join the sometimes scary, but real world. (Margot Robbie) portrays Barbie very simplistic, her approach works as that seems to be what Greta Gerwig aimed to show. Greta Gerwig differentiates the worlds developing both Barbie and Ken as they learn from their experience interacting with the real world. There appeared to be references to the Matrix to me as Barbie is given a choice between staying in Barbie world or going to the real world to discover what's causing her malfunctions. Also the owner Ruth Marianna Handler gives off an Oracle vibe in the scene where she offers Barbie tea. One little girl blames Barbie claiming she set women back decades making them stereotypical girly girls without a purpose except looking pretty putting clothes on and off and doing house chores.<br><br>(Ryan Gosling) gives Ken a lot of charisma and is purposely obnoxious at times creating an antagonist for Barbie. The Ken's are portrayed as weak little love puppies in Barbie world without a purpose juxtaposed with how women are received in the real world. Gosling reminds me of a wrestling villain that the crowd are wanting to hate on, he is a little over the top as he is turned against his fellow Ken's by Barbie manipulation. The poor performance of Gosling attempting to cry towards the climax added to the later half of the movie losing it way. It all becomes a little too silly leaving the audience flabbergasted at what absurdity they just witnessed.",5
" Perfection!
","I saw Barbie yesterday with four women friends. We didn't know what to expect, but we all loved the movie! The writing was amazing. The acting was perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were a great team. The music and dancing was truly entertaining. I actually cared about the characters, all the Barbies, all the Kens, as well as the mother and daughter in the ""real"" world. Will Ferrell was at his peak comedically. I also appreciated the overlay of politics, for those who are so inclined. I plan to see it again. I think more men should see it, as it treats men with compassion, humor and hope.",10

Writing: 6/10
Pacing: 6/10
Overall: 6.25/10
Audience: 12+<br><br>Acting: Great performance by Margot Robbie. Ryan Gosling didn't meet up to that standard however that is more due to the script he was given rather than himself. Nice to see cameos from Rob Brydon and Asim Chaudhry.<br><br>Cinematography: Set in both 'Barbie Land' and the 'Real World', the lighting remained saturated and vivid throughout the film, embodying the standard lightheartedness of a fantasy comedy film. The scenes in the 'Real World' were less vibrant than 'Barbie Land', creating a strong wall that separates the troubles of the 'Real World' and 'Barbie Land'.<br><br>Writing: With the aim to spread awareness about gender quality, Barbie did not meet this objective. Unison wasn't able to be built between men and women as the film took the approach to put the genders against eachother, making it a competitive fight to overthrow one another.<br><br>Pacing: Despite being 2 hours long, the film felt fairly quick but had some sequences which loses the audiences attention.<br><br>Audience: Although the traditional barbie dolls are targeted towards young children, this film is applicable to persons aged 12 and over due to the political and social subjects of the plotline.",6
" Brilliant film that showcases womanhood perfectly
","Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie's world and the satire of the Ken's and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie's speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara's monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society's imperfections. Men who say this film isn't good or ""anti-man"", is part of the problem.",10
" Hi Barbie, Hi Ken
","I am clearly not the target audience for this one but I still enjoyed it.<br><br>Went and saw in the cinemas which of course added to the overall experience.<br><br>Yea this is made for a younger audience and is slightly directed towards women but that doesn't mean it is one-sided or lacks depth. The character arch of Ken (Ryan Gosling) was is most enjoyable for me, he is the real star of this film. I felt the heavy anti-patriarchy angle for Barbie (Margot Robbie) was a bit ham-fisted.<br><br>I will say that they couldn't of picked a better person to play Barbie, Margot Robbie just encapsulates the over-the-top nature, 'perfect look' and clueless attitude that we expect from Barbie.<br><br>The only jokes I laughed at were either from Ken or Weird Barbie, I would say 90% were Ken. This isn't a bad thing more of a lack of interesting and funny characters.<br><br>The cinematography and settings are amazing and stunning to look at. They did a great job at grounding Barbie World in reality but also not taking itself too seriously - very self-aware.<br><br>This is a fun watch for all, lets just hope they don't bring out a sequel (pre sure they already are)",6
" Another Greta masterpiece
","Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.<br><br>Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll. But well wel well, it happened.<br><br>Anyway, it deserves all the hype. Margot Robbie IS Barbie, there is nobody who could've done the role justice like her.<br><br>And Ryan? Well, he's just Ken.",10
" The mainstream doll with not such a mainstream film
","I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.<br><br>This film is a hard one to unpick as it's just chaos, there's so much going on all the time, so much so that the slower moments act as nice breathers for the audience. There's dance sequences, action sequences, jokes, gender politics and somewhere in here there's the typical Barbie plot that you might presume this film would have but it's covered with loads of other stuff. The thing I'm most torn on with this film is that I want to praise Gerwig for creating a Barbie film that no one would have predicted while at the same time I can't help wondering if I personally would have enjoyed it more had it been more generic. I'm always talking about how films should be more creative and yet this is the question this film has me asking myself. It's just different and it definitely isn't a kids film, a young girl sat a couple of rows behind me had to keep asking her mum what was going on and I don't blame her as if I was 6,7,8 years old I wouldn't have had a clue. This film seems to be aimed at women Greta's age which is a surprise to me as I thought she was in her late twenties for some reason but you can Google her actual age if you wish to know. Now I know her actual age some of the more older niche references to bands and films etc make more sense and I think it's women that are a similar age to her that she's trying to appeal to here.<br><br>That brings me onto the films central theming which is its gender politics. It's a film that's about women and for women and in that it does a great job, I think for its target audience it could be an impactful and empowering piece of art. That being said however if you're a pre teen girl or a man you might not get the full emotional impact of this film and I feel that's a bit of a missed opportunity. If this film had eased up on the gender politics at times I think it could have appealed to a wider audience and in doing so may have been able to spread the films message further but I think it's largely ended up falling on death ears to those who aren't in its target audience. It's a shame because the film has an important message to share about equality but it's one that men need to get onboard with as much as women to bring about any real change.<br><br>By the way, for a film that's supposed to be telling women to be who they are and challenge the patriarchy why has a trend been created for women to wear pink to this film considering it's one of the most commonly associated colours with women?<br><br>Overall I'm not the target audience for this film but I had a good time nonetheless, it's not one I'll be hurrying back too with haste though.",6
" Fighting against the sleep

I'm wondering if people really enjoyed the movie or only told that that have enjoyed it to please the others...

" Not even Plastic
","This film is filled with cheap cinematic and comedic tricks dying for attention and relevance. In the end, the moments are stale and require as sense of ""I guess I should laugh or chuckle a little, poor things.""<br><br>The film preys solely upon the desperate desire permeating American culture for something, anything, please. (Nope still don't have anything original or high-quality in this Era of film-making).<br><br>Most sequences of the film are a collection of ""unbelievable!"" instagram-like moments strung together with a lazy unity that affirms one thing: confusion.<br><br>This film grossly underestimates the IQ of its audience or lacks the subtly and nuance to pursue the complex arguments regarding its central socio-political themes. It says only so much, afraid at every step to be cancelled but also trying to stand firm in some desperation for truth, to help stand up to that mean Mattel! The same Mattel that Warner Bros (who produced the Barbie film) is partnered with.<br><br>Margot Robbie tries to give it her all (she can open one eye tear stream with the best of them) but her performance lacks the quiet composure of all struggling with identity issues. It is surely a barbie-rific film! Although even the fake smiles of the actors seem fake, almost as if they are saying, ""I can't believe I am doing this."" They almost solemnly predict the end of the film before a single ounce of real joy can be seen/had. The entire film is depressing, even where it is supposed to be joyful.<br><br>There is no great sense of play. It appears everyone is outstandingly self-conscious and hyper aware. Weirdly hyper aware. These aren't artists (with perhaps the exception of Gosling). These are everyday men and women pretending to be actors and absurdly conscious of it. One can only get along with color palettes, explosions, and circus jokes / ""provocative"" one liners for so long. The real attempt at story was shaky at best. Amazingly studios allow Gerwig to direct a high school film project with a 150 million dollar budget and a volunteer casting call of beginning drama students and a few pretty people who always wanted to be in a movie.<br><br>The long wait gets longer. When will art take a step forward? We have an American culture of business people (all greedy for more money, money, money)-very well, we lack artists!",2

" Hard movie to review
","""Barbie"" to me is one of the harder movies to review because I don't know whether I liked it or not. This review will just come from the hip and i'm going to list the good and the bad and finally rate it off of what i've reviewed, so here goes...<br><br>""Barbie"" is a comedy/adventure/fantasy about the doll/dolls made by Mattel but with lots of twists on the story. I loved Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in both their respective roles of Barbie and Ken. Several other character were fun and likeable too, even the small cameo from the man you can't see. The score was fitting, the story was very much fun and entertaining and the ""musical""? Performances they put on in some scenes were great too, but where I had a problem with the movie was that at times, it just left me empty especially at that ending. Wasn't a big fan of that, could've been better. And I dislike that they, instead of putting the actual Barbie song in the end credits, they used a rap remix. At times the acting was cheesy but i'll forgive that since the movie was very self-aware. All in all... Think i'll give ""Barbie"" a 7/10. Was good but left more to be desired.",7
" This one's for you!!
","You'll never going to hate this movie, as soon as possible!!<br><br>So, I finally watch the new Barbie movie in theatres, but as soon as I watch the movie, I'm very shy to see her in real-life at this point. Me and my niece, and my cousin went to the mall to watch this movie. Mario Movie is for kids, but Barbie was not either made for kids though, but it's a live-action movie. I rate this movie a perfect star 10/10.<br><br>In under a span of a month, it's official. The ""Barbie"" movie will surpass Mario Bros. Which is still standing on top of the box office. So now, I'm tired of people saying positive things about ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" and this is why the negative reviewers are getting crapped on because our reviews are our opinion that they don't like.",10
" It's an OK movie, runs a little long but funny enough to be decently entertaining
","This movie is about the best movie you can make with the Barbie franchise. I still found it to be a relatively average movie. I suspect part of that may be that I'm not the originally intended audience, but it may also be that this movie wants to be a thought provoking and social commentary film while handcuffed to the Barbie IP.<br><br>The casting is fine, Margot Robbie does a good job as Stereotypical Barbie, Ryan Gosling is ok as Sterotypical Ken. Simu Liu is a fun addition as are Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera. I don't know, didn't feel like there were any knockout performances nor any terrible ones.<br><br>The writing is fine. Again, hands are somewhat tied because the whole movie is a pointed critique on Barbie and Mattel's spotted history as it relates to female empowerment but also capitalist consumerism. And then in the next scene they have some of the sickest product placement for a car in the Chevy Blazer EV. Still, it's a decently funny film with good self-awareness and a script that isn't afraid to take punches (rightfully so) at Mattel. So many punches in fact that I'm surprised Mattel OK'ed the script.<br><br>Even if I personally didn't get much out of it, I'm sure there's messaging in there that will resonate more to other audiences. I mean there has to be because some of the dialogue is very on the nose. I'm not sure if that's a product of bad writing, constrained runtime, or the very setting of the film, but the sweeping brainwashing and the subsequent deprogramming speech are not very fleshed out; they're pretty generic speeches and not particularly rousing. Normally not a critique I'd levy on a toy movie, but for a movie with a central and visible motif on empowering the every-woman, a tired mother just trying her best, I'd expect something a little more profound.<br><br>I did quite like the obscure lore that this movie brought to the spotlight. Seems to be a successful strategy pioneered by Disney's Marvel, built on by Sony's Spider-Verse, and now replicated by Mattel's Barbie. What a weird evolution. It's fun though, Alan is great, there's an entire graveyard of discontinued Barbie variants, I wish they had found a way to tie in the Mattel debacle with Computer Scientist Barbie.<br><br>At just under 2 hours, the movie does feel a little long. I think there are some minor pacing issues but I'm not sure where I would fix what.<br><br>Overall, it's an OK movie. Pretty much exactly the quality I'd expect out of a Barbie movie but executed in a manner I'd never have predicted. Social commentary that feels strange considering how good this movie has been for the company it criticizes.",7
" NOSTALGIA
","This movie is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it would be your average formulaic movie, but no. This movie is deep. It explores topics such as feminism &amp; the patriarchy, femininity, existentialism, and a lot more. It uses incredible comedy to make its points, and hence, doesn't come across preachy at all.<br><br>Greta Gerwig is absolutely incredible, this is 100% her best work so far. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did a splendid job, as did the rest of the supporting characters.<br><br>Also, the nostalgia you'll feel when you watch this movie is insane. It's so crazy how similar every girl's Barbie play-stories are. I love that I'm just like other girls!!",9
" Barbie
","I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend. They are 11 and they seemed to enjoy it. The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for. This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters.",7
" A very poor film
","I heard it was preachy before going to watch it, but still expected it to be a fun, easy watch. I feel like this is being rated higher because people think there's an important message in there but this shouldn't distract anyone from the fact that it's a very, very bad film with a terrible storyline. After a promising start it becomes excruciatingly boring and predictable. The storyline is what you'd expect from a poorly written children's film, but its wrapped in a heavy handed adult theme. Box office smash but it will be forgotten very quickly. Only highlights were Margot Robbie's performance and Michael Cera and Kate Mckinnons small but funny parts.",3
" SO SO SO GOOD
","I loved this movie so much. It's so effortlessly funny with the end being heartfelt and quite sad. The soundtrack is amazing including one of my favorite songs by billie eilish ""what was i made for."" The song is so amazing and finishes off the movie in the best way possible.<br><br>Barbie took a very unexpected turn of events that did not appear in the trailer (i think this is a good thing) and was full of plot twists that thickened the storyline.<br><br>It is great for all ages and genders as it has a lot of relatable characters.<br><br>Overall i think it is a movie to definitely add to your watchlist and go see in your nearest cinema!!",10
" She's Everything. He's Just Ken.
","Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the ""Real-World"" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.",7
" A Huge Generalization at Best
","What can I say? I went into this expecting at least a few laughs. The trailers didn't even show or come close to reveal the heart of the plot. So here it is:
Everything is so horrible and wrong for women today, and most men hate women. Now, as a woman watching this movie, I felt as if I was supposedly being told how much my life as sucked, and how much men have stolen from me. Which is not at all the case. I've had the pleasure of working with men who respect me in a good career, and found the movie distastefully disrespectful of everything I've ever accomplished.<br><br>I had a few laughs, but found the movie lacking a sense of real purpose and direction. It seemed as though it was seeking to inform everyone about this new agenda that women should be in charge of everything. Wow, sounds like sexism to me. I'd prefer equality, which is something that we currently have.",2
" Loved.
","This movie didn't really fit with all the other movies I love like fight club and things like it but I am secretly so connected with it. It really has the power to make me cry and laugh and I just have fun watching it. I truely love Greta and I think she did such an amazing job , so did america , I hope she wins best supporting actress because her monologue was incredible. I have been to watch this movie twice now because I love all the important details. It's so perfected to every last part , the same pink feel to it. It makes you love being a girl and love girlhood. It's a great meaningful movie.",8
" It's Barbie and It's Ken
","On a comedic level, Barbie is perfect. Obviously aware of trending topics and internet memes, the movie never fails to burst waves of laughter every three to five minutes. Every element in this film will become a punchline at one point or another, including awkward dialogues, exaggerated movements, unexpected responses, the Sex Education trio, John Cena cameo, Helen Mirren's epic one-liner, and much more. One actor to be complimented is Ryan Gosling, who bestows a childly himbo character Ken with charismatic idiocy and amusing lightheartedness, in great contrast to his previous sigma characters like K from Blade Runner 2049.<br><br>In terms of story, though, not much success can be claimed. With the movie's central conflict revolve around gender inequity, Barbie highlights the problem clearly, but provides an ambiguous answer. Although Gloria's monologue was unquestionably badass, both her and Sasha's character arcs are quite unconvincing. In general, the film gives either opaque or passive solutions to gender issues, which align with mainstream opinion, but are inherently fantastical especially with the plain storyline.<br><br>In my opinion, Barbie's box office wonder largely results from its marketing, whether the grand casting, the luring mystique, or the bombastic pink. And yes, the movie is incredible for its aestheticism and creativity, but the story is overly fantastical and lacking gravity.",7
" different people will perceive it differently
","For one. I really liked it and all the people I know that went to liked it and most of them did get emotional throughout( tears) . But I did show emotions in it but not as prominent , the movie will help people through times that some people have not been through (ie men) but even if you are a man I would still recommend this movie I have no real big complaints but also nothing to right home about that won't give anything away. Other than it's humar and when to use it , the movie knows when to crack a joke and when to move the plot further, I did really like the premise I'm glad how they went for the story and once again i would recommend it to anyone, most complaints that I have heard in person are from people that didn't give it a good try.",8
" Starts well..but goes downhil!
","I heard so much about the movie, thanks to all the marketing and the controversy (not sure what it was). ....and finally watched it. It seemed fun at first. Loved the whole production, the set designs and costumes. But the movie dragged in parts, and it just got worst towards the end. I wish they had a solid and fun ending, but they tried to go a different way, which didnt sit well with me. Don't want to really comment about the feminism empowerment, I am all for it but it was too in your face, and this being supposed to be a light and fun movie, ruined the entertainment for me. Being a women, there are of course many issues faced in reality. But this one didn't really nail it.<br><br>Among the performances Ryan Gosling was really good as Ken. Margot is very likeable in the movie and looks gorgeous. Will Ferrell was fun to watch and I'm glad he was in the movie.<br><br>Overall a confusing plot, I wouldn't watch it again. The movie was a little less than 2 hrs Why did I felt it longer?",7
" Fantastic Journey To The Plastic World
","Barbie may seem like a kids movie at a glance but its more than that. Even though kids are going to love it (no doubt) this movie is specifically made for adults who used to play with the original Barbies. The Barbies that were shown in the movie being exact same as our own childhood dolls takes you back in the past.<br><br>Margot Robbie's every single action, either crying and laying down on floor or smiling while kissing, is exactly same as a Barbie doll.<br><br>America Farrera's monologue deserves multiple nominations. She stole the show. Simu Liu was fantastic in it and actually made me sad for Ryan Gosling's Ken.<br><br>Ken Song is another masterpiece of this movie but it's not as iconic as Will Ferrel calling himself the 'mother' but the best part about the movie was including and remembering Ruth, the founder of Barbie, and her daughter Barbara.<br><br>The movie broke the wall in unexpected ways, it's classic comedy direct to audience was one of the many great aspects that I loved.<br><br>Even though I expected a better ending for Ken and other Barbies the movie ended on a happy note which delighted me.",10
" lighthearted and fun
","I definitely enjoyed watching it. It was light hearted and fun. However, I do find the asethetic a bit too bright for the eyes. Ironic. I know. Just personal preference. Music too loud at times too.<br><br>I do like the message it gets across. It does make me think about the power imbalance of genders and possibly how all genders are oppressed under the patriarchy. It was pretty well done considering how many messages they need to delivers in such a short time. However, I do wish the story was a little bit deeper and that the twists and turns are a little less straight forward. Too much to ask? Maybe.<br><br>But I like it and feel more empowered after watching.",7
" Lot of hype and very little substance
","Watched the movie last week as family since daughter wanted to see it. The marketing engine has been working overtime as there is a lot of hype generated by placing Barbie topic everywhere. The actors did great job in the role and script they have been given, but the movie falls short on delivering experience. The storyline is mediocre at best with gaps in places and the ending is confusing as if the writer hit a brick wall.<br><br>Mattel is only eyeing profits from movie and metch sales and paying zero attention to actually creating good movie. Comparing this to LEGO which was far better all round.",5
" Plastic & Fantastic
","Taking the joy and levity of the Mattel dynasty that is Barbie, and throwing the perfect figure into real world social issues creates an excellent fish-out-of-water plot. Addressing gender issues in a bright and (mostly) light-hearted manner gives the film an excellent moral without becoming preachy. Anyone vehemently against messages transmitted in the film must have strong opinions on whether these issues are a reality, as there is nothing controversial here, just a doll tackling common sense.<br><br>Success comes from the film's perfect casting. Robbie could not be bettered, with a positive and bubbly attitude wonderfully transitioning through something as dark as an existential crisis. Even issues around her character supposedly losing her beauty are brilliantly maneuvered through some excellent fourth-wall breaking.<br><br>Gosling leans into the camp brainlessness of his Ken to create a persona both lovable and problematic, but most importantly hilarious. The wider cast is star-studded, the roster of Barbies and Kens including the likes of McKinnon, Liu and Cera, with real-world characters from Ferrera and Ferrell. All this added to with ridiculous cameos throughout.<br><br>Brilliantly funny, the dialogue and comedy can range from deadpan to daft depending on the scenario. Easter eggs are thrown in throughout and even those without an interest in the doll growing up can at least appreciate the references on show.<br><br>Fantastic costuming and props, the brightness of Barbieland is joyous to see and so perfectly contrasted with in the real world. A real directorial masterclass from Gerwig, somehow offering a fun perspective on gender inequalities.",8

" Big Budget Fluff
","Unfortunately this story is so bad the acting and sets can't save it .<br><br>It is pretty to look at like a Barbie , but lacks a story that is worth the effort .<br><br>I think small girls will like it but other than that it's a stupid movie idea that comes across as an advertisement for a toy company .<br><br>Not sure you will want to spend your money on this wait for it to stream .<br><br>Kids fell asleep after the first 30 minutes .<br><br>Not sure who the audience is .<br><br>The story is so bad it's like it was hobbled together by a bunch of tweens brainstorming .<br><br>I think this could be the worst movie of the decade .<br><br>There are much better kids movies out there.",4
" Must-Watch for Women Empowerment
","When I watched the trailer for the first time, I wasn't sure if I would want to watch the movie, but all the great marketing and internet hype made me excited so I watched it, and I couldn't be happier! I have to say that at least every girl should watch this movie!!!<br><br>The representation of girls ""in a man's world"" and the difference between a fantasy and the reality are shown greatly, but apart from that, the movie and the script just carry such a powerful message towards women that should be heard. When I went out of the cinema, I felt so empowered and self-confident!<br><br>Kudos to Greta Gerwig and her entire team for creating such a vital movie for women.<br><br>Another important fact is that the actors and actresses absolutely nailed it!!! Margot Robbie played her role so well, I was actually convinced she was Barbie, and Ryan Gosling had the absolute best facial expressions. I enjoyed watching them sooo much. Worthy to mention is also the awesome work of the other actors and actresses: THEY WERE ALL AMAZING!!! Whoever did the casting for this movie should get a raise. Everybody managed to portray their characters so well!!!<br><br>One of my favorite scenes was the fight between the Kens because of how realistic the actors played it!<br><br>And the costumes and decorations/houses should also be acknowledged. I watched the Dreamhouse Tour on YouTube and I appreciated all the detail so much! Barbie's cowboy costume was the banger, I think that was my favourite fit from the entire movie.<br><br>And the music!!! ""I'm just Ken"" is still stuck in my head, and whenever it comes on shuffle, I scream to it dramatically. :) But it's not only this song, I keep listening to the Barbie Album on Spotify because all the songs are so catchy!!!<br><br>I really want to rewatch this movie!!! It's a solid 10/10 from me. :) (I'm a girl, btw, if you couldn't tell xD.)",10
" Conversation-starter
","This movie is like an interesting conversation you strike up with a stranger, touching on all sorts of things but never really going deep into anything. I guess you can see it a trigger to discuss gender roles and existentialism with your friends after watching it. Unlike the Barbies though, most people tend to not form a life outlook after one powertalk.<br><br>The cast and the art direction are immaculate, with Ryan Gosling shining bright as a scene-stealer.<br><br>The plot doesn't flow though. The main issue is that the movie lacks balance between contrived and raw storytelling, so the whole endeavour seems clanky at times.",7
" Deep Meaning Behind Seemingly Innocent Facade
","Entering the cinema with the expectation of a colorful and girly adventure, I was surprised to find that this movie delved into deeper societal issues, transcending its supposed joyful facade. It skillfully addressed complex topics within a simple narrative, which captivated me. Despite its innocent appearance, the film was profoundly moving, evoking feelings of sadness, frustration, and anger. Watching it led me to embrace feminism but acknowledge that men also face their own issues. The movie's creator intended to shed light on the intricacies of being a woman, and the portrayal of Ken feeling left out highlights one of the many challenges women encounter daily in the real world. It made me realize how our society has always been so misogynistically setup.",10
" You're supposed to love being a mother but don't talk about your kids all the damn time.
","A movie that presents a very challenging undertaking taking on the Barbie franchise with incredible originality. A film that should be lauded for its ambition, creativity, and virtuous commentary. The acting is fantastic and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling feel like the only actors that could play Barbie and Ken and they more than excel at it. It feels as though Mattel partnered with Greta Gerwig and the movies production team to help make themselves the butt of the joke and also help make one of the most powerful (if not most powerful) statement for women and young girls in our modern world.

I've heard talks about this movie for YEARS, and it was different than I expected. I could recognize the performances were amazing and Greg blew it out of the park with the directing and writing and I had so much fun. But all I saw was a ""fun"" movie about ""being a women?""...<br><br>HOWEVER, after I left, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Now that I knew the plot I felt I had to watch again to really understand what the movie was saying. So I watched it AGAIN, and I never go to the movies twice! I was BLOWN AWAY.

say that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).<br><br>Is it boring? Mayyyybe but I don't think so.. does it need a 70MM IMAX? The answer is No No and No.. However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more..

" Barbie - A Spectacular Failure
","""Barbie"" - a movie that promised so much but delivered so little. I can't believe a film with such a beloved character could turn out to be this boring and devoid of any intelligence. It's simply a horrible cinematic experience, and I can't stress enough how much you won't miss if you choose to skip it. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that staring at a blank wall for two hours would be a more efficient use of your time.<br><br>This movie isn't just a disappointment; it's a disaster on multiple levels. It fails to cater to any age group - not for kids, not for teenagers, and certainly not for adults. It left me with the same feeling of disillusionment as ""Matrix 4"" and the final part of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."" It's baffling to see what's happening in the American film industry lately. Writers, producers, and directors seem to have lost touch with what makes a great movie, consistently churning out films that do nothing but disappoint.<br><br>In the case of ""Barbie,"" it's a classic example of how a beloved character can be mishandled on the big screen. Instead of bringing the magic of Barbie to life, this film manages to strip away everything that makes her special. Save yourself from this cinematic travesty and explore the countless other films that will truly entertain and delight. ""Barbie"" is not worth your time or your affection for the iconic doll.",4

You can see where it's headed a mile away. But the way it carves its own path there using its unique premise, the property, and its stylistic blend of modern humor that reflects the real world is particularly well done.

It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring.

It's been a while since I've seen such a genuinely fun and creative movie. Originality is what the world has been longing for!<br><br>The story is clever and manages to be remain lightheaded and witty, while also conveying influential messages for- and challenging the audience with questions about modern feminism and discovering who you really want to be, no matter who you are.<br><br>This film is colorful and 'alive', making it a joy to view upon. The set pieces, especially in Barbieland, are brilliant- and it truly makes me want to know if they actually built out a real-life Barbieland set. Did they?!<br><br>The acting was brilliant from everyone; you could tell they were all having a lot of enjoyment on set. Margot Robbie carried this film for sure, as one can come to expect from this modern superstar. It was also enlightening to see Ryan Gosling take on such a comical role while also bringing a lot of depth to the character. He has a great sense of comedic timing and humor. From what I've seen in interviews, Ryan is basically embracing his comedic genius and I love it.<br><br>I usually despise singing and dancing in movies, but in this film it put a smile on my face. Not just because it was amusing to watch, but because these people can actually perform really well on these fronts. It goes without saying that the music for this film was on point as well.<br><br>I highly recommend everyone to go see this film, though maybe don't watch it directly before or after ""Oppenheimer"" in case you're following the current trend. Let both films sink in for a bit because they each deserve the attention.",8
" I'm just Ken
",I only saw this movie for Ryan gosling and I was not disappointed. Bro brought the humor into this movie like he does with every movie that he is in. His performance was impeccable and kenough. To be fair I was a bit high so I was laughing a lot in the theatres and I was with my gf also seeing the movie. And I just love how Ryan aka ken brought the character to life in a special way. And of course the song he made is just absolutely wonderful in everyway. One of his best performances ever highly recommend for kids and for families to go and enjoy themselves. As Ryan gosling would say I'm just Ken and I'm enough.,7
" Now I am become death, destroyer of the patriarchy
","(Note: I highly recommend seeing both this film and Oppenheimer as a double feature. Both are heavy handed films that have characters going through an existential crisis and are consumed with thoughts of death. You would think these two films have nothing in common, but I'm dead serious - no pun intended.)<br><br>When your film has your narrator saying the word ""feminism"" in the first five minutes, you know it's going to be problematic.<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong. I have no problem with feminism and I consider myself a feminist. Some of my favorite films have feminist characters. I knew going in this film was going to be woke. I just didn't realize how woke till I saw it, which was kind of a disappointment anyway.<br><br>First off, don't let the cutesy pink marketing fool you. This is not a film for kids, but that happens quite a lot in Hollywood. For example, Drop Dead Fred was a film I saw when I was 10, but it was really for adults. But at least it wasn't woke. I felt kind of sorry for the little girls I saw wearing their pretty pink outfits and dresses knowing that probably much of the preaching against the patriarchy and lack of genitalia jokes were going to go over their heads.<br><br>Yep. I said what I said. It only gets worse from there.<br><br>Margot Robbie plays the titular Barbie who lives in Barbieland with all her fellow Barbies that can do it all and have it all. The Kens are kind of just...there. The main Ken played by Ryan Gosling, gets tired of being from friend zoned and taken for granted by Barbie. When Barbie starts to have thoughts of her own mortality, has flat feet, and cellulite, she is advised by Kate McKinnon (one of the few bright spots in the film as Weird Barbie) to go to the Real World to find the girl who's playing with her and make everything right. Ken decides to stow away in Barbie's pink Corvette. Both of them discover the Real World is not what it seems.<br><br>My biggest problem with this film was the constant preachiness, especially when Barbie and Ken go to the Real World, and it never really stops from there. I resented Greta Gerwig for ""giving the game away"". There's a way to talk about feminism without hammering it over the head and alienating half your audience, in this case men, but I doubt many men will see it. It's like that South Park episode when Randy makes a musical that explicitly talks about oral sex until he is advised to tone it down and hide the message in subtext. That's what Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach should have done with the story. This is a film that definitely skews toward a female audience. It needed to be more subtle with the messaging. I would have preferred a fun, silly, colorful Barbie film rather than having a woke agenda pushed on me. Unfortunately, that's the direction Hollywood seems to have embraced these days.<br><br>However, the visuals were bright, fun, and colorful along with the hairstyles and wardrobe. I liked that they filmed in the Venice Beach Boardwalk and other areas around LA. Despite the diversity of the cast, my mom was unhappy that she didn't see a Hispanic Barbie and Ken (even though we saw a white, black, and Asian Ken). If there were any in the cast, I didn't see them. America Ferreira and her daughter are indeed Latina, but that wasn't enough for her. She does have a point, though, but we could be wrong and missed them. Will Ferrell is wasted as the CEO of Mattel, but I don't care for him anyway, so it didn't really matter that I didn't see him much. Rhea Perlman did have a nice little part as the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler.<br><br>This film was very strange and I felt kind of alienated by it. Plus, the last scene of the film was anticlimactic and totally bizarre. I get the good intentions by the filmmakers, but it was way too preachy for me. Legally Blonde was the closest to a Barbie film up until this point and it was a feminist film that never felt like it was preaching to its audience. Elle Woods was a blonde Barbie type character who was underestimated because of her looks, but manages to showcase her intelligence and strength as a successful lawyer without the message of the story becoming too heavy handed and retaining the lighthearted playfulness throughout, which is what Barbie is missing. I think I'll just stick to that film instead.",5
" Amazing storyline
","I didn't know how many points to give it but I give it a 10 because I have no negatives, I went to watch this movie at the premiere and it was great. The actors did a great job wow! The outfits were also on point. And the easter eggs to Barbies that they were no longer allowed to make was also fun. And the Barbies in the real world was kinda fun how they did was really well done.

" ""Barbie: A Whimsical Journey of Self-Discovery""
","""Barbie"" is a film that left me with mixed feelings. While it had its strengths, like Ryan Gosling's exceptional performance and emotionally impactful scenes, I found the film to be a bit overloaded with messages. Some parts were polarizing, and the humor occasionally missed the mark.<br><br>Spoiler alert: The film's message about embracing uncertainty and self-discovery was commendable, but the execution sometimes seemed confusing. The protagonist's journey towards self-acceptance could have led her to a simple job, symbolizing personal growth. Instead, the choice to visit a gynecologist seemed a little too on the nose.<br><br>One standout aspect was the beautiful message conveyed through Billie's song, which added an exquisite touch to the film. Overall, I'd rate ""Barbie"" 7/10 stars for its strong performances and emotional moments, but it could have benefited from a more focused approach to its messages.",6
" One for the Identity Lost Generation
","Underneath the corporate irony and plate-spinning, there's a film that is mildly humorous; if not a tad lost with it's identity and message. A battle between feminism and stereotyping. Is this a film for young girls? I don't know, it feels as if it's wondered off the reservation. Is it a film for women - more than likely. There's heartfelt messaging at the curtain closing, but it very much straddles the fence between traditional conservative womanhood and progressive girl boss ""smash the patriarchy"".<br><br>Speaking of patriarchy, this film drops the p-word countless times. And the image of masculinity is confusing, is Ken masculine or campy and confused? Horse obsessed, gym bro, with a passion for theatrics and fur coats - traditional masculine, doubtful.<br><br>I don't know who this film was made for, or where it stands on anything. The safe corporate mediocre middle ground is where this film stakes it's claim for your attention and money.<br><br>Enjoy it by all means, if you can straighten out it's allegorical message, then please let me know.",5
" In Awe
","I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy. It's worth it, it really really is. Bravo!!!!!!!",10
" What is Barbie?
","Was I expecting more from Greta gerwig? Yes!<br><br>Form the trailers, i never got a solid idea what Barbie the film was: a musical, a comedy, a coming of age story, a metaphor for something greater ? Maybe Barbie tries all of the above to a shallow extend. There are deep ideas introduced that immediately caught my attention. Several in fact, scattered strategically at the beginning, middle, and close to the end. The thing is that those ideas are never fully developed and some even forgotten. The film's comedy is delivered in pastels, pink jokes that rarely made me laugh.<br><br>Strangely, the film aesthetic, which is pastels, is not quite fully realized either: or pushed to its full vibrancy like in a WES ANDERSON film. The jokes are bland neither too sophisticated for adults to get them, or charmingly innocent for kids to enjoy them.<br><br>Margo does a good job as Barbie, but is good good enough for a leading role where the fantasy was being sold to me? Honestly, I never actually believed it. Margo never looks like Barbie herself , aside the colors and the imposed name. She did what she could, but I never got the fantasy of Barbie. I believed Reese whiterspoon in legally blonde to be more Barbie like than Margo Robbie herself.<br><br>The film has great refreshing moments like America ferrera's scenes , full of vigorous lines and life. Also, Ryan gosling gives an excellent portrayal of a ken with an existential crisis. The ending dancing number: fun and amazing. That number alone could potentially go for award nominations.<br><br>Would I recommend the film to fans of Barbie, yes. Would I personally sit through to watch it again, no.<br><br>All and all, I walked away the theater not knowing for sure what Barbie the movie was. It is the weakest project artistically speaking from Greta gerwig. In Barbie, Greta's magic and quirky comedic take on life is muddle among so many different things thrown together; it looses the comedy of Frances ha, and the driving force of nature that is lady bird.",7
" Not made for me but loved nonetheless
","As a man who has never touched a barbie in my life, I was definitely not the intended audience for this film. However, I absolutely enjoyed it. It's funny, entertaining, and poignant. I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive ""person's"" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it. I think any guy tagging along to see this will enjoy it unless he's a misogynist and/or very insecure in his masculinity.",10
" A largely positive message, wrapped in a fun package but the execution could have been improved
","Firstly, the marketing for Barbie was great. The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday.<br><br>Greta Gerwig largely succeeded in creating a fun film that gets her message across although it sometimes became a bit heavy handed at the expense of the narrative and tempo of the Movie.<br><br>Barbie takes on the noble cause of trying to undo the message portrayed by its early history, reposition the expectations of females (and Barbie dolls) and shine a light on the patriarchy which exists in our society. It's a movie based on a kids toy but aimed at an older demographic who can internalise these messages.<br><br>The opening act was fantastic. We were introduced to a fantasy Barbie Land which is everything we could have hoped for. The set design in immense and filled with predominantly modern day Barbies living their dream life in Doll houses. Margot Robbie, who plays ''stereotypical Barbie' was made for the roll and Ryan Gosling is great as Ken. The supporting cast are also a lot of fun.<br><br>In the second act we are given a cause to enter the Real World where we are introduced to Will Ferrall and the Mattel Corporation. They were the least interesting part of the movie. One of the main issue is that they weren't realistic and blurred the lines between the tone of Barbie Land and the real world. Whilst some of their jokes were funny a number of them missed, something that was true of the movie as a whole. We are also introduced to other real world characters who have a bigger role to play.<br><br>In the third act, things pick up again as we are able to explore Barbie Land. We get an stand-off between competing ideologies which is largely entertaining and funny. In this act there are a number key moments which reinforce the message of the film followed by several resolutions which may or may not please the general audience. There are parts of this act which could have been done better especially when it comes to the overall workings of Barbie Land.<br><br>Barbie teased being a simple movie about a doll and instead went for the bigger goal of being a strong feminist movie and calling out the patriarchy. Overall there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barbie movie. It aims to deliver a positive message to its core audience however this sometimes comes at the expense of the narrative and tempo of movie as a whole.<br><br>I never imagined that there would be so many thoughts and discussion to have post a Barbie movie. If you are caught up in The Barbie hype it's worth seeing in the cinema otherwise watch it when it is released to the masses.",6
" Way better than expected
","I was amongst the people who thought they saw a majority of this film based on all of the filming stills posted on the bird app in 2022. I still wanted to see it. Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule. Sorry, Ken.",10
" Fun and more surprising than I expected
","Just watched the première of Barbie with my wife, my daughter and my son. I'm pleasantly surprised. Sure, it's a fun movie and Margot Robbie is gorgeous as Barbie (and Ryan Gosling is a perfect Ken). But the movie is, in fact, an interesting commentary on, both, patriarchy (and the negative effects Barbie dolls have had over the years) as well as on mortality. The movie is more profound than I would have thought. I'm also pleasantly surprised by the open-mindedness and humour of Mattel. What is missing is that the movie sometimes lacks intensity and becomes only candy for the eyes.<br><br>I'm giving 7/10 to Barbie.",7
" Wretched!! Simply.. WRETCHED!
","From Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies.<br><br>In fairness, maybe I'm the wrong demographic (Male/50's) for this movie.. but I did watch it with my wife. I can only describe it as wretched! It was seriously like watching people make up their lines and the storyline on-the-fly. It was so terrible, it was nauseating.<br><br>I didn't have high hopes for it simply because it didn't look interesting to me, so it was certainly not a matter of being let-down. It was like ""Grease"" meets ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (but both Grease &amp; RHPS are fun movies.. and I really liked them!) This had the campiness of Grease.. and the cheesiness of Rocky Horror. But the parts of those movies we liked or found endearing was complete absent in Barbie.<br><br>Visually.. I'd say it was certainly interesting. The premise of the movie also had some ability to be entertaining. But this thing was a massive waste of time in my book.<br><br>Though Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are actors I like in many movies, it's so beyond campy that I couldn't even find it funny (though a few, VERY few, areas had some laughs). Maybe part of the reason I found the movie ""wretched"" is because it was as if the director actually instructed the actors ""be as funny and over-the-top as you can"". It was like watching the 1980's bad cast of Saturday Night Live TRYING to be funny. Simply painful to watch. This is a rare movie I'll never want to watch again. Ever.",2
" Margot robbieeee
",In this film I loved I really like costumes and I really the main them on the film it was very good I thought that film will be for kids and children but it literally isn't it is for adults more than a child Margot Robbie is the perfect actress for the main Barbie but main ken could be a different actor Ryan gosling is ver handsome but he is too old for the main ken role I love the main message of the movie I love Emma in education series but she showed us she can be play in other type of roles and I like the pink theme it's very sweet and cute and last thank you all persons who worked in this film.,10
" Unexpected but... not?
","I enjoyed this film. I cried at the ending and I laughed out loud at some parts, which is something not many films can actually do to me. I LOVED the visuals - it felt exactly like Barbie should feel to look at, and I love how the film never seems to take itself too seriously, which again, is what I expect from a film about a Barbie doll.<br><br>Having said that, there were a few things I questioned. I'm not the target audience (being a 17 year old guy), but also... who WAS the target audience? It feels like it should be for kids, but it was far too existential for that, especially at the end, and some of the jokes were just blatantly sexual. Was it for people who used to own Barbies as a kid? It was still enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend it for small children or even children at all, really.<br><br>I feel like I have to be careful saying this, but the message of the film was a bit over the top. I understand it and I liked that it was there, but it felt a bit crammed down our throats. It almost feels like a caricature of our own world at times. The real world sucks, but the divide between men and women isn't THAT pronounced - not all men are incompetent, macho freaks who have everything handed to them on a silver platter, and not all women are suppressed as intensely as the film seems to suggest. Still, it was a good message and made me emotional at points, and it was still a fun film experience, albeit not what I was expecting.",7
" Mostly staid commentary
","I went in with high hopes for this one. The marketing of Barbie, of course, was top notch, and for a straight year audiences were given glimpses into this garish 90's realm, blue skies and beaches, neon roller blades and Ryan Gosling's bleached hair. Then my girlfriend and I both saw it, and we both yawned.<br><br>For one, Barbie herself is unfortunately a bore when she should have been the shining light. Margot Robbie is one of the best actors working right now, but she couldn't even elevate this Nietzsche-ish interpretation of the character beyond the staid, reductive messaging the movie is trying to impart. She comes across as a mouthpiece, rather than a well drawn, or even fun character.<br><br>She spends the whole movie disturbed by something outside of herself, 'questioning her place in the world', when the real highlight - Gosling as Ken - gets to roam around freely and steal all of the scenes. This seems brutally unfair, and kind of the opposite of the intended effect.<br><br>This kind of topical storyline that strives for relevance rather than the irreverence I was hoping for makes for an extremely boring watch. Sorry, but we got tired of Barbie and her iterations fast. We both want the Ken movie now.",5
" Very fun goofy movie
","Unlike most movies that come out,
Barbie is a fun adaptation and an excellent movie.<br><br>There is no serious tension in the movie, nor does it have a thrilling storyline but it's just a goofy movie and that's why it can't be compared to normal movies.<br><br>It's sort of like Tom and Jerry the movie that came out a few years ago, the first live action adaptation. There aren't many movies like it.<br><br>The acting is phenomenal to play the stereotypical characters from the barbie universe and the jokes are brutally honest and also funny.<br><br>This movie takes a turn from the regular sci-fi movies that come out on a daily basis and is a recommended watch for family time as well as people looking for something aside from the norm.",8
" It was more than kenough
","The Barbie movie is a mixture of comedy and an analysis of an old era idea, using scenery that rivals classics like Playtime, and a cast that was clearly hand-picked with stars like Margot Gosling and Farrell. The movie features an astonishing soundtrack, including Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, Billie, and much more. Barbie's presentation is top-notch, and some might even say it couldn't be any better (I would've agreed). However, the writing itself doesn't quite match its other impressive traits. Despite adapting the boring and monotonous toy line into something actually interesting on the big screen, it felt throughout the movie that the ideas of the writers were too disjointed. This led the director to piece together a self-exploration story with a modern world outlook, topped with media manipulation and a critique of society from a male perspective, with a side dish of a womanly critique of society. Safe to say, not every point got across as intended.<br><br>The plot starts in Barbie Land, where we witness Robbie's character's journey and her existential quest. Concerned for her designated child's fate due to the villainous scholiosis, the tall blonde takes action. The movie's second part shifts to real-life segments, offering hilarious situations with Ken &amp; Barbie. The perfect doll believes she's found her child but faces an unwelcome surprise, realizing the world is the opposite of her magical land; nobody admires loving Barbies, and the Kens are the ones in control. In contrast, the muscular blonde embraces and reshapes his former land into a fratboy utopia. After finding her true partner in the child's mother and returning to Barbie Land, the toy discovers its destruction under a horse-loving, Mojo Dojo Casa House Living, and beer-drinking government. With a pep talk from her former playmate, she learns about womanhood and reclaims her home using girl power.<br><br>And this, without the inclusion of Matel and the ending. It tries to reach for the stars with the juggling of three major themes, but it has the wings of Icarus, represented by its 2-hour runtime.<br><br>The main three themes are the search for one's self, the media prying on those who are deeply insecure, and the question of womanhood's position in society. However, not all themes were treated equally. The search for one's self, for example, had a great realization with the protagonist slowly becoming different from the others, becoming weird as the movie put it, and ending with the pursuit of reality, not succumbing to a safe bubble but embracing the truth fully. On the other hand, the theme of womanhood feels somewhat forced in the end, taking away from the main conflict.<br><br>The movie starts the process of exploring this theme with the conflict between Barbie and the child of her owner, showing that Barbie isn't as glorious as she felt. However, after this, nothing truly develops. The kid joins the journey and sees that Barbie is a woman just like her, which doesn't really correlate with anything before that. To be honest, it feels more like a relatable moment rather than an actual thing, but I guess that is what solves the big Kenland problem. The middle ground gets taken by the character arc of Ken, and his performance steals the show, but the way it's solved pretty much trivializes the issue Ken was facing, making it an unsatisfying ending that boils down to 'Men are big dumb-dumbs' is extremely unfortunate, as it was, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the movie. However, you can't really rival 'I am just Ken' part.<br><br>Something even more unfortunate was Farrell's character. He's such a good actor, but he was incredibly wasted in this role. I understand that it's a Barbie movie and kids will be there, and making the man in the suit dumb will make hilarious jokes for toddles. However, couldn't they you know, not put Farrell? His role doesn't really scream expertise, and other than that, they aren't even plot-relevant. I feel like if they just cut this part entirely, the movie would have had a lot more to gain. Besides, the movie is PG-13, so they don't really need to consider slapstick comedy (sorry for offending Mr. Bean Fans).<br><br>In conclusion, the Barbie movie is surprisingly more than Ken-ough. It provides an amazing soundtrack and even better performances. However, it didn't deliver that well in its plot points. I wouldn't say it's a must-see, but you might be missing out if you don't watch it.",7
" So fun!
","A fantastic fun summer movie! Barbie is not at all
What I thought it would be. We laughed through the entire movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely perfect as well as America Ferrera. Ryan Gosling plays ken so well with a great twist. The movie had a lot of laughs along with an amazing message. It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see. I went into the movie with no expectations and came out thrilled and wanting to see it again. I've seen a lot of film this summer and this was my favorite so far!",10
" The Lego Movie but for females
",Now please take into consideration that I am a man. And a white man at that.<br><br>Barbie was much better than I thought it was going to be. I'm just going to get into what I didn't like. Barbie starts off as a fun light hearted comedy movie. The first 30 mins are great! From then on the movie begins to have an identity crisis. It goes from deep feminist themes to a car commercial to a slide show to a 4th wall break depression Barbie ad and then a musical. One of my biggest problems was that I felt like the movie was talking to the audience too much. Things were being said or done visually in the movie not for the sake of the story but for the audience. Which maybe some people like but to me it kinda took me out of the experience.<br><br>Barbie wanted to be taken seriously but because of its inability to be consistent and justify the actions of certain characters and events it left the audience behind.<br><br>Like what is the purpose of Mr. Buisness(Will Ferrall)? Is he good? Is he evil? Does he care? Does he just want money? Why does he ask like a Barbie but he's from the real world?<br><br>At the end of the day I agree with a lot of what was being said and the themes that were built. I just don't think the movie is for me... at all. But I didn't hate it and Ryan Gosling gets a 💯/10.,7

" A Dazzling Dive into Feminism, Perfection, and Societal Expectations :)
","Hello,
Upon watching ""Barbie,"" directed by Greta Gerwig, I was immediately struck by the breathtaking visual spectacle the film offers. The vibrant universe and the ensemble cast, led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, transported me through a range of emotions. Robbie, in particular, impressed me with her charisma and depth.<br><br>The plot of the film, set in the Barbie Land where perfection is the norm, seemed to me a metaphor for our society's relentless need for perfection and the stigmas associated with imperfection. I felt the film raises pertinent questions about gender dynamics, societal norms, and the challenges faced by women, albeit sometimes a tad overtly.<br><br>Many have lauded the technical aspects of the film, such as the genuine soundstage, impeccable costumes, and memorable musical numbers. However, what stood out the most to me is the film's commitment to pushing boundaries. While the marketing showcased the film as a whimsical take on the iconic doll, ""Barbie"" goes way beyond mere glitter.<br><br>Like any film that tries to juggle societal commentary and entertainment, ""Barbie"" might not resonate with everyone. However, I view it as a brave attempt that defies norms, much like its main character. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. It's a film that deserves to be seen, if not for its visual splendor, then for its remarkable performances.",7
" Eh, not for me.
","It was not as light-hearted and fun as I was hoping. I wasn't expecting such a deep message to be told to me by a Barbie. There is a lot of satire in the film, that I feel some will take to be truths.<br><br>But, costumes and sets were on point! I hope that team gets all the nods for their accomplishments. The soundtrack is lacking, too. Maybe I do not have many nice things about this film, other than it wasn't for me. Instead of it being a cute comedy, I became more depressed by watching the movie! Margot and Gosling played their roles well, and I applaud them. But the other all content, was just too deep, and not fun.",4
" The Most Moving Film I've Ever Seen
","I'm not even joking when I say this was the most moving film I've ever seen. Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things: either is was going to be very dumb and bad, or it would be absolutely amazing. No in between. And now, I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about Barbies, or any toys in general, to make me feel. I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation.<br><br>Before I get into why specifically I loved it so much, I would like to first say that to the men out there that are calling this movie ""man-hating,"" you could not be more wrong. If you think that, then clearly you went in with your own preconceived notions and did not pay enough attention to the message of the movie. I also am a man and this movie delivered a beautifully written feminist message that depicted unfair societal stereotypes placed onto women and proved the reasons why the patriarchy is truly a bad thing. Just because it did that, does not make it man-hating, especially since it also depicted and drew awareness to negative societal pressure placed onto men and their emotions.<br><br>Now, onto why I really loved this movie. First off, it was very funny and light hearted at exactly the right points. I liked that it left room for dramatic scenes that could really tug at the heart strings and Margot Robbie in particular delivered a very powerful performance. Yes, she had great comedic timing, but her talent really showed in more emotional scenes where Barbie felt she had to still act like her happy smiley self despite the overwhelming sadness she was feeling. Not only that, but the costumes and sets were immaculate. It was not only well written and acted, but clearly a lot of care went into the movie from the crew. Each character, even despite their limited screen time, was fleshed out and everyone did a great job making their characters unique and different from each other.<br><br>This movie made me think so much. I had to let it fester in my brain for a few days before writing a review because I had so many thoughts. I know many people wished it was more light hearted at times, but I am so glad it wasn't, because if it was, it never could have been as powerful and emotional for me. The writers and directors could have taken a more silly, childish approach, but instead they decided upon a story that could make the world a better place, and I have to commend that.<br><br>Overall, the Barbie Movie was so much more than I ever could have expected it to be and I urge anyone who hasn't yet to go watch it, especially if you have an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart. As of right now, my rating is a 9/10, but I definitely think it will increase once I inevitably watch it again. I think this movie has the potential to do a lot of good for the world.",10
" The Little Mermaid meets Pleasantville, the Musical
","I can honestly say that ""Barbie"" is one of those movies where you either completely love it or hate it. Either way, there seems to be very little gray matter - and it's the type of film where you simply sit back and enjoy the ride. As a former Barbie connoisseur now in her 40's, I was curious how producers would carry this film. And since nothing is completely original now, I couldn't ignore the overtones similar to 1998's Pleasantville - with our female protagonist postulating the human world outside of ""Barbieland"". Alas, toward the third act, the movie seemed to whip into a full-fledged ""Mama Mia"" production and I wondered amusingly what the hell I was watching at times. There were parts that were downright silly (Ryan Gosling's performance as Ken was hilarious, but borderline over-the-top, to say the least). However, the profound messages of diversity, female empowerment, personal acceptance and loving thyself were ubiquitous (I mean, they REALLY stressed it from start to finish), and little girls across the globe should find the movie worthy of embracing. For us middle-aged moms, you'll delight in several heartfelt chuckles...not to mention the wonderful tie-ins to discontinued Barbies from our past. But once the credits role, you'll also realize one viewing is enough.",7
" Nice scenography
","Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.<br><br>Development of the characters is non existent so they are constantly changing their mood and personality without any explanation.",3
" Sometimes it's hard to be a woman.
","As I have a strong antipathy toward films based on toys and video games, I wasn't sure I'd see BARBIE. However, I had a free evening and, I'll admit, all the hoopla made me curious. So I kicked off my vacation with a visit to my local theater.<br><br>I thought about 80% of BARBIE was very well done. Among its strong points:<br><br><ul><li>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, each of whom turned in a dazzling performance;</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Rhea Perlman, Kate McKinnon, and Will Ferrell were also very good, along with Helen Mirren as the sardonic narrator;</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>The script was loaded with razor-sharp one-liners;</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>The film's depiction of Barbieland was magnificent;</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>The slapstick touches were hilarious;</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Its utter savaging of Mattell (and corporate culture in general). Clearly, the company has a sense of humor!</li></ul><br><br>Here's what I could have done without:<br><br><ul><li>Great Gerwig's monologues, which I find as wearing as Oliver Stone's;</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>The ending was too drawn out, in particular the final scene between Margot Robbie and Rhea Perlman.</li></ul><br><br>I can see BARBIE garnering several Oscar nominations (if not always wins). Among them:<br><br><ul><li>Best Picture</li><li>Best Actress (Margot Robbie)</li><li>Best Actor (Ryan Gosling)</li><li>Best Original Screenplay (Greta Gerwig &amp; Noah Baumbach)</li><li>Best Visual Effects</li></ul><br><br>Finally: if I've ever come across to women like the Kens did after they took over Barbieland, I'm deeply embarrassed and oh, so sorry!",8
" Fun but unnecessarily bitter and divisive
","This film has hilarious moments and it visually looks good with the set, costume, and prop designs. HOWEVER, the film shoves its agendas down our throats like it's thanksgiving dinner.<br><br>The marketing team played it off as just a fun, harmless, self-aware comedy but the end result is this cake full of feminism, mockery of the entire male species, outright preachy at times and covered in icing of a colorful fun experience.<br><br>The movie contrasts Barbieland as female-dominated/controlling with men to the sidelines who just are just there to wave at barbie or something. Likewise, in the real world, men control everything and women are just there to look pretty and clean and stuff. The film shows half the human population (the men) as utterly and irredeemably horrible.<br><br>And by the end you would assume they would compromise and have equal power and respect and everyone would see the value of men and women being both pretty awesome and that they should work together as a team? Nope! The Kens just wither back to the sidelines to their depressing selves while the Barbies go back to their girl-power or ruling everything without thinking twice about it. It feels like they almost had a good ending, but simply just couldn't help themselves.<br><br>In front of where me and my friends were sitting was this mom and her two daughters who seemed around 5 and 7 and that poor little girl was squirming in her seat and asking ""Is it almost over?"" multiple times to her mom who was trying to quiet her down during another preachy scene. Do not take your little girls to this one. Truly a wolf in sheep's clothing. Using a kid's toy as a trojan horse for feminist messaging is just ridiculous.",7
" Fab and Fun, Kenough
","This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it.",10
" An unrisky yet effective comment on gender issues
","Male loneliness is directly tied to the high value that we give to romantic relationships, as it tends undervalue any other form of love. It results in a current (and big) social problem: straight men who have zero valuable, deep and intimate relationships with people other than their girlfriends or wives. Men depend on women as a source for happiness through romantic love. That's why many straight men have no identity other than being a boyfriend, a husband, a provider.<br><br>Ken and Barbie had to enter the real world to realize this, among more important and focal problems related to feminity and the place of women in society (which were precise but I don't write about because, as a cisgender man, I think is more valuable if I talk about masculinity and male problems). They question their identity and Ken realizes he doesn't know himself or his place if he doesn't have Barbie by his side.<br><br>This is not something that I see discussed much in commercial cinema, so I'm glad it was and that's why I focus only in that subject in this review, because it was my favorite message related to the male characters. With the rest of the movie there are many things that could've been done better, such as the self critique/parody and the meta-irony, but the good elements surpassed the negatives ones in my opinion. It's a fun movie, it's very simple, but you know, sometimes less is more (and I think it's better that way in Barbie).<br><br>It's not the movie of the year and it's definitely not Gerwig's best or deeper film, but it's worth noticing the biggest commercial flick of the year to be a sort-of gender issues 101 to people who might haven't even question their gendered role in today's society beyond ""men work, women shelter and that's screwed up"". It's as feminist as a Hollywood commercial film can be.<br><br>My favorite Barbie is Hari Nef's Doctor Barbie.",7
" Smart, hilarious and so creative all at the same time!
","So hilarious and intelligently written. The writers sincerely can't be credited enough with how smart and funny this movie is. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and find new jokes, there's just so many! If you're uptight about the way many women feel how they ""fit into"" society, then this movie may not be for you. But, you're missing out. I hope the academy finally starts recognizing comedies. It's so much more difficult to write something funny and be an actor that can pull of true comedy than drama. It just is. You have to be new, creative and intelligent. Dramas, you can just play things that people automatically get emotional about, It's so hard to figure out what many will find funny, yet alone hilarious. The Academy should nominate Gosling (sp?) for best actor, Robbie for best actress, the move for best screen play and movie. It was just so creative and funny. Loved it, and honestly, I thought I'd hate it.",10
" Just watched the barbie movie
","When you have a cast as big as this film the space for error is low, and although the movie is lots of fun there are still some nitpicks. Lots of the jokes don't land but the ones that do really make you laugh. Margot Robbie gives a great performance and is going to be remembered as barbie for ever. Will Ferrell is very under utilised for such an iconic actor. There's some emotional stuff at the end and that didn't really resonate with me that much, but it might be different for other people. But the best part of this film is Ryan Gosling as Ken let alone all the Kens are great, the musical number and fight they have at the end is the absolute best part of the movie.",6
" A Disappointing Experience: Barbie Movie Review
","As an avid moviegoer, I recently had the misfortune of watching the latest Barbie movie, and I must say, it was a truly disappointing experience. With high hopes for an entertaining and engaging story, I found myself utterly let down by the lackluster execution and uninspiring plot.<br><br>First and foremost, the storyline was incredibly predictable and formulaic. It followed the typical ""princess in distress"" narrative, where Barbie, the protagonist, finds herself in a series of contrived situations that require her to rely on her friends to save the day. This tired and overused plotline failed to offer any surprises or originality, leaving me feeling bored and unengaged throughout the entire film.<br><br>Furthermore, the characters lacked depth and development. Barbie, as the central character, was portrayed as a one-dimensional, perfect individual with no flaws or relatable qualities. This made it difficult to connect with her on any meaningful level, resulting in a lack of emotional investment in her journey. The supporting characters were equally unremarkable, serving as mere plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out individuals.<br><br>The animation, while visually appealing at times, was inconsistent and failed to impress. Certain scenes appeared rushed and poorly executed, with noticeable flaws in character movements and facial expressions. This lack of attention to detail further detracted from the overall viewing experience.<br><br>Additionally, the dialogue was clichéd and lacked any real substance. The script seemed to rely heavily on cheesy one-liners and forced humor, which fell flat and failed to elicit any genuine laughter or amusement. The lack of witty and intelligent dialogue further contributed to the overall mediocrity of the film.<br><br>In conclusion, the Barbie movie I recently watched was a major disappointment. With a predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and lackluster animation. While it may appeal to younger audiences, for those seeking a more sophisticated and thought-provoking film, this Barbie movie falls far short of expectations. I would not recommend it to anyone seeking quality entertainment.",2
" If only she hadn't preached at us...
","""Barbie"" is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year and yet it's also the most infuriating. Highly imaginative, (it's got the best pre-credit sequence in years), and laugh-out-loud funny it's got ideas to burn and therein lies the problem. Director and co-writer, (with partner Noah Baumbach), Greta Gerwig has set out to make the ultimate feminist tract dressed up in the brightest of pinks as a satire and while it works perfectly well as a satire full of self-conscious digs at its very creation, (we are constantly being reminded this is a movie called ""Barbie"" that we're watching), it's as a tract that it's in danger of sinking. That it doesn't is very much to Gerwig's credit; she's much too smart to really ruin her product and there is an awful lot here to enjoy.<br><br>The thin plot has Barbie and Ken leaving Barbieland for the real world so Barbie can repair some sort of hole in the spectrum or some such nonsense that has allowed 'real' feelings (of a negative kind) to slip in and, naturally, since this is a film about dolls coming to life, it's decidedly silly and if had stayed silly it might have been inconsequential fun but Gerwig and Baumbach wants this to be 'consequential' fun, a laugh-a-minute message movie. Unfortunately one message doesn't appear to be enough; there were times I felt I was being battered to death by a giant message-wielding Barbie and by the time Will Ferrell's CEO of Mattel has left the real world for Barbieland the laughs had begun to dry up.<br><br>Perhaps if someone had snipped about 20 minutes from the running time and dropped a few of the film's sermons this might have been the classic it was clearly aiming to be; that said, there are a lot of plusses here. It looks fantastic, the best gags are as good as anything Gerwig or Baumbach have given us in the past and best of all, it's got a couple of living dolls worthy of the name.<br><br>Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, (there's even an in-joke about her in the movie), and, of course, she's wonderful and yet the film isn't hers. Barbie really belongs to Ryan Gosling who might become the first actor to be Oscar-nominated for playing a doll and given that the film is structured to make him a mouthpiece for its creators he brings an uncanny degree of feeling to the role and his performance is up there with his very best. As for Gerwig, maybe now that she's got her inner Barbie out of her system she might finally settle down to make comedies that are funny and meaningful and leave the sermons at home. We already know how good she can be.",8
" Started well but ended badly
","Was thrilled at start. What with all the pinks and blues and wow the reference to "" Planet of the Apes"" and ""Thus spake Zarathustra"". Somehow Greta or the writer did not know how to proceed after the Ken takeover and ended it all with almost a Christian sermon, however feminist it may sound and gave an American ending of all's well. Had expected more.<br><br>The actors were great. And after the overall hype of Barbieheimer, and of course having seen the Heimer part of it before it was insufficient for me to give a better score. Don't get me wrong it's good if you want to have a good laugh and not really go out with something to chew on.",6
" Started good, then turned into a lecture
","I really wanted to like the movie, and I totally enjoyed the first third of it, until it turned into a lecture on patriarchy. Women are portrayed as infinitely oppressed people who can't do anything except for crying about their existence.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I expected it to be about feminism and empowerment, but not that awfully straightforward about it.<br><br>I could've been a great movie. A 10/10 movie, but it feels like the authors just hate men so much, they can't think of anything else.<br><br>I also feel sorry for all female executives at Mattel. The board of directors is portrayed as oppressively male-only, to maintain the narrative.<br><br>To sum up, you gonna love it if you want to feel sad and oppressed about being a woman. Not so much if you just like Barbies and want to have a good time.",5
" I already need to see it again!
","It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!",10
" Heavy duty marketing
","The movie was very good. It had comic moments, impeccable costumes and exceptional acting, as well as necessary political dialogues. However, despite these strengths, the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. It felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution, resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the well-crafted narrative. While the movie has its merits, the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again. However, it is worth recognizing the film's strengths and the thought-provoking discussions it initiated.",7
" Life in Plastic It's Fantastic
","Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.<br><br>Barbie 2023 is a delightful and refreshing film that celebrates Barbie as a cultural icon and a role model for girls and women of all ages. It is incredibly funny and smart, with a terrific ensemble cast that all go for it in the best ways. It is also a clever and creative film that explores various themes and issues that are relevant and relatable to today's society. It is a film that can appeal to a wide range of audiences, from fans of Barbie to fans of comedy to fans of cinema. It is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen. Give Gosling the Oscar AND the Grammy!",8
" The wait was worth it.
","It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it! And Ryan Gosling... come on, i was expecting so much from him, and he was even better than i tought, so freaking funny and always on point! The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.<br><br>Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all. I think it's a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well.",7
" A movie that made me proud to be a women
","This movie is not only lighthearted but a way of exploring how women are seen within society. To Barbie she views herself as someone that strives to be able to do anything a man could do and to her she thought that mirrored to the real world. The movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual. To me, the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and I felt it had such a deep message to be proud that I am a woman. It also referenced how just because toy Ken is an accessory to Barbie that doesn't have to be his only personality trait which I believed showed a great way of presenting the film was not only about women's explorations and feelings but men's as well.",10
" incredible costuming but...
","I have questions: when the kens take over Barbie land, they see the Barbies as just accessories but then when the Barbies just swap places every ken still had a Barbie why would they even care as long as they still have a pretty thing listening? I just feel like that scene was kind of random and odd I guess. I still enjoy the film overall it was very visually appealing. Will ferrells character was just cheap laughs, nothing new for him. He's too childlike to believe he intends any ill will for barbie so it really takes the wind out of the movies sails. Also the parallels between this and don't worry darling and they have the same flaw in my opinion. An unclear driving force of why this is happening now - randomly thinking about death? I would have preferred to have seen her be picked up in the real world and then the reveal that it was gloria and not the daughter could have been a more significant moment and they could have fleshed out Gloria's yearning for girlhood more and why she played with the dolls.",7
" So, so bad
","It got a 3 because there were a few laughs.<br><br>But if we are being true to Barbie, she is 19, Ken is 17, so these two leads are too old to play these characters. But that aside. This was a terribley bad movie. The story line was so silly, the characters were so stupid, in the literal sense. I was really looking forward to watching this with my daughter, well the whole family really, but my daughter especially, and she hated the movie. The whole family did. We were all bored, all didn't like the story, all thought it was stupid. I always judge how bad a movie is when an entire room sits in total disappointment at the end.<br><br>We all couldn't wait to see this, we wanted it to be amazing. It wasn't even close.<br><br>Major, major disappointment. Sadly.",3
" Unexpectedly totally awesome
","When I'm going to see a movie I don't do research beforehand. I like to make up my own mind and hate spoilers. I didn't even have a look at the trailer in this case so I really didn't know what to expect from Barbie.<br><br>But it's a gorgeous masterpiece, clever, surprisingly deep. People who say it's not just don't get it. For real.<br><br>The full message is round up at the very end.<br><br>I laughed, I cried, it truly hit me right in the feels.<br><br>The set was out of this world. The costume designs were awesome.<br><br>Performances by Margot, Ryan, America were fantastic. The rest was great too.<br><br>Can't wait to see it again &lt;3.",10
" A mix of masterful and missed opportunity
","The 1968 picture Planet of the Apes reverses traditional roles. After time-travelling thousands of years into the future, astronaut Charlton Heston discovers a world where apes are the advanced primate, and humans their chattels.<br><br>I hated the movie as a boy, in as good a way as it is possible to hate a film. Could it happen, I wondered, where humans could become inferior to another species? If it did, would we deserve it? The film haunted me enough at age 13 to ensure I have never dared rewatch it.<br><br>The 2023 movie Barbie looks nothing like Planet of the Apes. Its cinematography is an exercise in high-octane kitsch, as unapologetically saccharine and unrealistic as the dolls it is designed to sell. Yet it too explores role reversal, here between sexes rather than species.<br><br>Barbieland is a quasi-mirror image of Realworld, the film's moniker for present-day California. Barbieland is a gynocracy and a matriarchy. The Barbies, for they are multiple, live happy, fulfilled lives. They prosper at the top of every profession and public office. They never age, bodily imperfections are impossible, and life is a perpetual merry-go-round of choreographed parties, infinite outfit changes and enduring sisterhood. The men - the Kens - are decoration. They are unable to perform even basic functions: physical and sexual. They lack genitals. Their muscles are impressive but purely for show. They preen on the beach, but surfing is beyond them.<br><br>One day, Classic Barbie (Margot Robbie) awakens to discover her pristine feet no longer arch perfectly into her high-heeled shoes. She no longer walks on immaculately pedicured tiptoes, but on flat, ordinary, soles, to the collective horror of her sisterhood.<br><br>Robbie realises something is wrong, and - following a revelation from her compatriot Weird Barbie - sets out to Realworld to resolve it. Classic Ken (Ryan Gosling) stows away in her car. The duo eventually arrive in Santa Monica via a series of rose-tinted vehicles.<br><br>It isn't long before Gosling discovers that Realworld is unlike Barbieworld. Here, the power is held by men. Gosling, surprised to be treated with respect, becomes fascinated with patriarchy, and quickly warms to the paradigm. For Robbie, the experience is the opposite. People mock her. Daily life is threatening, not fun. Her self-confidence warps into self-consciousness. Ken precedes her return to Barbieland, and quickly sets about transforming the pink paradise into Kendom, a toyish grotesque of Realworld, where the Kens are in charge, and the Barbies retained as ornamental servants.<br><br>Much ensues. We race and chase SUVs with the mother-and-daughter pair who own Robbie's doll in Realworld. There's an overlong musical sequence, in which Gosling reprises his singing and dancing shift in La La Land. Mattel's all-male c-suite, led by the one-dimensional Will Ferrell, provide limited laughs, and add little to the plot, beyond an admirable modicum of self-awareness. Products are placed - even Chanel! - with abandon. Still, we are being entertained and, mostly, engaged.<br><br>The final act sees Barbie and friends manipulate the Kens and prevail. There are no suffragers in Barbieland and, following a unanimous referendum of an all-female electorate, the natural order of things is restored. A dark, compelling, twist looks imminent, but it never arrives.<br><br>Rather than lean into the exquisite role reversal narrative, director Greta Gerwig retreats from it. Instead of pressing her male audience to consider how they would like it if what patriarchal societies do to women was done to them, her finale ploughs a much shallower furrow into well-trodden ideas about the link between mortality and existentialism: 'I die, therefore I am.'<br><br>Robbie's Barbie eventually opts not to live in Barbieworld, but as a real, imperfect woman in Los Angeles. This is not apparently because she hates what counterrevolutionary Barbieworld might itself become, but because she likes the idea of being human. How do the remaining Barbies perceive their homeland? Do they support gynocracy? Are they comfortable with the Kens being sidelined? The passive ambiguity here is uncharacteristic of a screenplay that, for the first 85 minutes, hammers home its message relentlessly and precisely.<br><br>The narrator (Helen Mirren) assures us that one day the Kens might enjoy the same status in Barbieworld that women do in Realworld. It is hard to see even that unambitious prospectus being realised, given the Kens are gainlessly employed, politically disenfranchised and allowed to hold only junior roles in the judiciary. Barbie and Ken experience equality in neither Barbieworld nor Realworld: in both realms one sex is always subservient to the other. Perhaps Barbie ultimately prefers LA because, despite its manifold flaws, it at least has no pretence to being a utopia.<br><br>In Planet of the Apes, we discover, in the final reel, that Heston's destination is not a dystopian otherworld, but Earth itself. Through nuclear war, man's hatred, greed, and hubris has caused his own downfall. The oppressor has become the oppressed; perhaps man deserves it? In Barbie, Gerwig avoids such a subversive conclusion. Instead, she ends with the weakest element of a thoughtful movie: a syrupy anticlimax more predictable of Hollywood, and Mattel.",7
" My first thought was, I didn't love it but I didn't hate it
","I genuinely had planned to give the movie a 5 because it wasn't bad but it wasn't good but then the longer I have had to think after the movie I still feel that way but also like the movie was a waste of time and money. I really had hoped it was going to be amazing!! It is Barbie for crying out loud. And while I have never been a huge fan of playing with them, they are iconic. I also felt they cast Ken and Barbie perfectly. However the movie made little sense, their are no really good amazing lines to quote, and the ending was blah. It wasn't very fun or funny either. So I decided it gets a 2 instead of a five.",2
" A Beautiful Commentary on the Real World
","This movie is everything and more. It's comedic, colorful, entertaining, heartfelt, nostalgic, and has such a truly meaningful message that's fit for everyone.<br><br>While the movie pokes fun at the patriarchy, it's a beautifully written commentary on how the patriarchy affects everyone, not just women. Where Ryan Gosling's Ken was struggling to find who he really is, because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity. There's also the more obvious example of the Barbies being brainwashed into servitude.<br><br>As marvelously played by Margot Robbie, Barbie feels the struggles that many women face - where we feel lost at some point in our lives. America Ferrera's monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary. This movie positively shows the beauty of womanhood.<br><br>Barbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come!",10
" Not what I expected
","As of today's date, I would say this is the film produced by Luckychap Entertainment that I've liked the least, despite a more than promising trailer. Despite a perfect cast (Margot Robbie &amp; Ryan Gosling seem to be born to play these roles, and the adorable America Ferrera &amp; Emma Mackey are always a delight to have on screen) + sets &amp; atmosphere that exceeded my expectations, I wasn't convinced by the storytelling at the end. The first half of the film is great, but things get complicated when Barbie &amp; Ken leave Barbieland, and here we fall into the trap of a war of the sexes, when I think it would have been more appropriate to try and raise awareness of the fact that ""domination"" never serves anyone. In short, the film is worth seeing, but I have to admit that given my expectations of it, I'm a little disappointed, even if the costumes/settings/acting are stunning.",7
" Believe the hype
","Words cannot express how happy I am that the high expectations I had due to the hype were more than fulfilled. The story is beautiful, the execution makes it brilliant. I really felt the joy and energy that everyone put in to make this possible. Margot makes a perfect Barbie, but Ryan's Ken is just perfection. I really hope they will get showered with awards and recognition!<br><br>The attention to detail is stunning. The movie often shows such iconic elements that kids that played with Barbies immediately recognize. In my opinion they did a great job on balancing the fact that they are dolls, but they are still played by real people.<br><br>Some points of critique: at times the pace felt rushed, for my mother depending on subtitles combined with the visual pace, it was not always easy for her to follow. I was expecting a lot more fashion from Barbie, it seemed that Ken was more in focus on serving the looks. Some musical numbers dragged a bit too long.<br><br>But still I give it a 10!",10
" Deep yet hollow
","Was just okay. The acting is super, ryan makes a super funny and suave ken i think. And margot is a perfect barbie, she ate her role up. !this is not a kids movie! Has many innapropriate things and comments i was not expecting. Most of the humour lands for me honestly, i thought it was cute. The diolouge isn't best but it's a movie about barbie what were any of us really expecting.<br><br>It was kinda confusing towards the end. The begininng was really fun- maybe a little bit annoying but that's just me, like i said, not my type of film. The colors were great, the barbieland set was cute. After they got back from the real world it kinda fell apart for me. I thought they were gonna go a wholeeeee different route than the ken patriarchy taking over? Then the barbies make them fight eachother and make up? And everythings fine? They tried to make it deep and meaningful but it flatlined along the way. It seems like the whole build up was leading to the monolouge scene. I feel the feminist point of the film would've come across better if it was introduced over time instead of having a few blatent comments here and there and then BOOM big monolouge. It was just a lot, but empty at the same time.<br><br>And i get what they were trying to do in the real world with having barbie be constantly catcalled but that also got to be a lot i think. Like, point proven, all women have had that happen to them. It was a bit overdone and got a little uncomfy.<br><br>And nothing was ever really resolved in the real world? Besides the mom and daughter with barbie. And then at the end you think barbies getting a job at mattel, first female ceo, feminism, but no she's just going to the gynocologist. Yeah it was a funny and unexpected moment but they had a chance to do something and they didn't take it.<br><br>Overall much different than expected. This dealt with more serious subjects and got way deeper into patriarchal ideas than i was prepared for. Thought it was going to be lighthearted!<br><br>So, idk. It was cute- i may be too hard on it cause i enjoy movies that make you think and have deeper elements. All the elements here were blatently there. Also i'm saying all this as a young adult female- i know i was one of the target audiences for this.",6
" The Style !
","Greta Gerwig's style is jumping through the screen. The cinematography and set designs are brilliant here, as Barbie goes from Barbie World to the real world. Gotta say, it's particularly touching. I didn't expect to get emotional but the movie got me one or two times. Margot Robbie is a star as always, and her acting absolutely delivers, showing the inner conflicts of the character, all in nuance and sincerity.<br><br>This film is definitely not for kids, as it focuses on problems and dilemmas adults have to deal with. The writing isn't perfect by any means, but overall Barbie is a pretty fun adventure.",8
" Bright Pink Fun
",Barbie is basically exactly what we need right now. A hilarious summer blockbuster with a social commentary nuanced enough to allow young ones to enjoy but present enough for you to get something out of it. Margot Robbie is brilliant and a perfect Barbie. Gosling shows off his incredible comedic talent more than ever.<br><br>Most all the jokes land well. It's clear that the actors understood Gerwig's vision and Gerwig and Baumbach's script. Set and costume design are on another level in Barbie. The distinction between Barbieland and the real world is done very well thanks to set design.<br><br>See Barbie!,7
" The Godfather is way better
","Okay, so I'm a 30 year old woman, feminist and cinephile. I left the theater feeling both confused and a bit disappointed. I really wanted to like this film. It's about damn time we have more female directors topping the box office. And I gotta say, the costume and set design of this film was incredible. But the entire plot of the story was all over the place, leaving me feeling little to no empathy for the characters, albeit Ken. Now Ryan Gosling MADE this movie. Though at times, I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be the antagonist or puppy dog we were supposed to sympathize with. What really got to me about this movie were the stereotypes, which just contradicted the entire message. Scenes that were meant to be moving fell flat. Characters had very little development. There was no real conflict or climax. The end was funny but switched the mood entirely too soon. And hey, I actually love The Godfather. I still love it more than Barbie. And I'm a chick...so there ya go.",5
" the love letter to girls we all needed
","Where to begin? With flamboyance of Barbie and the emotions of Greta Gerwig, this is the best release of the year so far. To address it all to mothers, specifically, and STILL touch the hearts of girls all around. To talk so, SO honestly about what it's like being a girl. To say it in the first ten minutes - ""I can have feelings and use logic at the same time and it does not take away from my worth."" to have Barbie look at her body and hate it and to make her look at an old woman and see just how beautiful her ""imperfections"" make her. To make it about growing up, but also about remaining a child. To remind girls to be both. To make the perfect example of what adolescence means to a girl. Just genius.",10
" A mixed bag that is enjoyable and funny while still being a bit of a let down
","Greta Gerwig's latest offering, ""Barbie"", starring the effervescent Margot Robbie and the charismatic Ryan Gosling, had high expectations to meet. The film provides an ample amount of humor and maintains an enjoyable pace. However, it falls short of its potential as a sharp, thought-provoking commentary on our society's obsession with aesthetic perfection and constructed identities.<br><br>First, let's talk about the performances. Margot Robbie is fantastic in her role as Barbie, breathing life into the plastic figurine with an effortlessly humorous and convincing portrayal. Her comedic timing is impeccable, and her delivery of the lines lands smoothly every time, making for a lot of laughs.<br><br>Unfortunately, Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken didn't manage to hit the same high notes. As a Gosling enthusiast myself, it's disappointing to witness his usually nuanced performance taking a backseat. His portrayal was overdone, his actions and dialogue feeling more like caricature than character. However, considering the history of Gerwig's adept directing, it's plausible to believe the responsibility for this creative choice doesn't lie solely with Gosling.<br><br>As a social commentary, ""Barbie"" delivers some pointed insights into our societal norms and expectations but, frustratingly, its treatment of these complex themes often feels too overt, which detracts from the potential impact. The film's humor, though consistently amusing, lacks the subtlety that could have transformed it into a more incisive satire.<br><br>The musical elements of the film were, interestingly, among its strongest aspects. The colorful, campy musical numbers added to the film's eccentricity, and it's a shame these weren't more of a focus. Their quirky charm offered a delightful contrast to the sometimes too-obvious comedy of the rest of the film.<br><br>While it was an entertaining watch, ""Barbie"" didn't quite meet the high expectations I had for a Gerwig-directed social commentary. However, this may be more a testament to the immense respect I have for her previous work than a damning critique of the film itself. It's still an enjoyable movie, full of laughs and energy, and Margot Robbie's performance alone is worth the price of admission.<br><br>In conclusion, while ""Barbie"" may not have been as witty or sharp as hoped, it still provides a solidly entertaining viewing experience. Despite its flaws, it's a fun film that will keep you laughing throughout and offer a few insights to chew on.",7
" Boring with heavy political messaging
","Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs. Yes, the word patriarchy is said like 100 times. It's crazy. This was so heavy handed I don't even get why woman would like it....ithis should be fun, not some political statement. Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell. I'm telling you most people will not like this movie, unless you're far far left.",4
" Hilarious with genuine touches of emotion
","I went in to this movie expecting to it to be fun based on the trove a press for it.<br><br>It does not disappoint. Margot Robbie brought a depth of emotion to the role that makes it a special character and performance. America Ferrera also was sensational and is probably an under appreciated actor for as much as she consistently delivers in her films and shows.<br><br>Gosling, Liu, and Kingsley Ben-Adir brought plenty of the expected levity for the Ken roles. Gosling is well known for both his dramatic and comedic abilities at this point, but selfishly watching him ham it up and be funny never gets old.<br><br>As expected, the movie had plenty of ludicrously silly moments that and brought humor from a lot of different directions and perspectives.<br><br>Specifically, the mini-dissection of the patriarchy and evolution of the characters to more fully realize themselves played very well to me.<br><br>I could not recommend this movie enough. As worthwhile as any two hours you can spend.",10
" Barbie it's interesting, confusing, and a lot of fun
","Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.",6
" Wonderful
","Such a silly, beautiful, wonderful movie! This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It has heart, soul, and lots of laughs. I've seen it twice so far and it honestly gets better with each watch. I'm looking forward to owning it when it comes out for purchase as well. This will definitely be one I watch a lot. Ryan Gosling's Ken is everything, and he's absolutely perfect. This entire movie is perfect. I don't want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S. Isn't not ""sexist"" it's making a point, and people that have a problem with what it's saying should probably ask themselves why and look inwards.",10
" Good but too much
","So, I just wanna say that I was very hyped for this movie. But after I watched this, I was a bit disappointed.<br><br>The movie has a lot of cringe scenes. One of them are funny too, but at some point this is just cringe and too much.<br><br>About the message of this movie, I agree with it and i like it because in our world women are really disrespected, harassed and so on, but at some point it was too much. I say this as a male, but one of my friends, who is a girl, has the same opinion. But the other one, with the mom and the teenager rebonding, that was amazing.<br><br>The sound tracks are really good tho. To include artists like Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish and so on is a great move to make this film an iconic one.<br><br>The cast is great and I think Margot Robbie played Barbie perfectly with her acting and her appearance too.<br><br>In conclusion, I recommend this movie because I think this is a film that anyone has to watch because it's a Barbie one, and it can also teach teenagers a lesson, despite the cringe scenes.",6
" Movie of the summer
","Barbie<br><br>Dazzling, heartfelt and brilliantly funny. Comedy of the year, movie of the summer!<br><br>Barbie is a beautiful blend of comedy and heart. Aided deftly by colourful visuals, Greta Gerwig tells the story of a doll coming to life, with as much intellect and emotion that's needed.<br><br>Barbie is unabashedly feminist, will ruffle some feathers (as it should), and will delight even more people. Themes of existentialism, individualism and masculinity are also dealt with.<br><br>Despite being a product of Mattel, Greta found a way to critique the parent company (although it's funny that the product that mocks the maker ends up raking in more money for the maker).<br><br>Margot Robbie is Barbie! She was an agreeable canvas, and she allowed Greta Gerwig to paint a very nuanced portrayal of Barbie. Ryan Gosling turns out a career-best performance in Barbie, stealing and shining in all of his scenes. The supporting cast also gives great performances.<br><br>The soundtrack was fitting, guiding the movie down to the finish line with Billie Eilish's 'What was I made for' delivering a wonderful culmination. The set design and costumes were brilliant too.<br><br>The lore of Barbie spans over six decades, so compressing it all into one movie was a definite challenge, but Greta was able to bring the most important things (including Easter eggs and fan service) to the movie.<br><br>Barbie does have its failings, and the most noticeable is the plot. The first half is very intriguing, quirky and pays homage to other movies, but the second half isn't as tight.<br><br>Barbie isn't perfect but it's a beautiful dose of everything good.<br><br>8/10.",8
" Not what I expected, mildly thought provoking
","What I came away with the most is surprising puzzlement, not so much for the movie's message, but for my inability to account for Margot Robbie's hold on my attention. I can't say this movie impressed me very much, and I doubt many men will enjoy it, but there is time spent with Margot Robbie, who is really unique. I can't really think of another actress who seems to understand the inner workings of a lot more than most of her peers.<br><br>Her performance pulled me through what seemed a fair description of the problem of patriarchy as seen by women, at least. And an odd depiction of a 'perfect' women's world. I was left thinking Greta Gerwig is almost as unusual as Margot is, but, even so, she seems to not have found an answer to the question she poses in this movie. How do we reconcile the very different world's men and women prefer?<br><br>It's clever that she uses an iconic doll to make her point, but it's just a way to frame the whole question in a non-threatening way. Still, I can't think of a more entertaining introduction to the issue. And it helps that there are so many great performances in this movie, not to mention the wild sets and energetic production numbers. Not really my thing though I appreciate the skill with which they were rendered.",7
" Great marketing and great actors, mediocre movie
","Started well, had some great moments and acting was good.<br><br>However, the point of turning Kenland back to Barbieland...what was supposed to convey? That Barbies aka women actually want to live looking like Barbies in their almost identical Barbiehouses? That it's women against men and men their dreams are stupid?<br><br>I found the Mattel team going to Barbieland totally out of context and it didn't add anything either to idea or humor of the movie. Men leading the patriarchy in real world were made to look silly and idiotic, which didn't add anything to the ideas, but felt embarrassing rather than funny.<br><br>I found the movie weird, confusing and not empowering at all.",5
" From Mattel She Came...And Now She Has Conquered
","Where to begin?<br><br>If anyone had told you at the start of 2023 that the highest-grossing film of the year was going to be a film based on a female doll that first appeared in 1959, you'd probably have them trucked off to the funny farm. And yet that is what has happened with BARBIE. Somehow, perhaps through osmosis, Gerta Gerwig, one of Hollywood's great female directors of this age, known for films like 2017's LADY BIRD and 2019's LITTLE WOMEN (a great adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's literary masterpiece), has made the world's most famous doll become a huge deal, through a mix of goofiness, gaudiness, a certain amount of camp, satire, and pointed jabs at society.<br><br>Mrs. Gerwig has also managed to do so with a few references to films of the distant and not so distant past. Take the very opening scene, in which little girls of a previous ""era"" used to play with baby dolls, giving them the idea that the only ideal for a woman to be when she grew up was to be merely a mother. But then Barbie comes along, and inspires them to destroy the past to create a better future. Gerwig does this in clear but witty homage to the ""Dawn Of Man"" sequence that opens up director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, with Barbie standing in for the monolith, and the awestruck little girls standing in for the man-apes. Gerwig even went to the trouble to use both the portentous opening of Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and the Kyrie from Gyorgy Ligeti's ""Requiem"" from Kubrick's film (getting the hearty approval of Kubrick's family in the process).<br><br>After that, BARBIE goes into the adventures, and misadventures, of the world's most famous doll, in the personage of Margot Robbie (as the so-called ""stereotypical"" Barbie), and Ryan Gosling (LA LA LAND; FIRST MAN) as the original Ken. Robbie's existence with the other Barbies throughout time in Barbieland (which looks like a crazy amalgam of Hollywood, Venice, LAX, and Palm Springs rolled into one), finds her making her way into the Real World of today, and finding out, much to her shock, that being the ideal of perfection not only isn't all that it's cracked up to be, but that male patriarchy is the essence of everything in that world. In the meantime, Gosling's Ken, through reading about male patriarchy in high school books, leads a revolt with the ""other"" Kens to turn Barbieworld into ""Ken's World"", a symbol of male testosterone excess. The end result is crazy chaos, involving not only Mattel's CEO (Will Farrell), but also a mother (America Ferrera) and her daughter (Sascha Greenblatt), and Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), the actual woman responsible for having created the original Barbie.<br><br>With all these crazy things happening in the span of just under two hours, it is not surprising that some of the acting is rather overripe, and the jokes and sight gags don't always work. But given all this, and the fact that it sometimes seems on the verge of falling totally apart, the film stays on track due to Mrs. Gerwig's imaginative direction, and, most especially, Robbie's performance as Barbie, where she evolves from a stereotypical figure to a genuinely human one If some of the shots Mrs. Gerwig and her co-screenwriter Noah Bumbach take on the clichés of the status of men and women in the real world can sometimes border on blatant point-making, many of the others are so spot-on that one cannot help laughing at them once we get them.<br><br>Gerwig's film references, besides the aforementioned ""2001"" homage, include two more Kubrick classics (DOCTOR STRANGELOVE; THE SHINING), plus THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG, THE WIZARD OF OZ, GREASE, and SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, to name just a few. In the end, however, BARBIE is a totally original and insane piece of both old and new Hollywood at its best. For this, Gerwig, Robbie, and Gosling, along with the droll narration of Dame Helen Mirren, deserve tons of credit, as they managed to make what could easily have been an unmitigated disaster into a memorable and wholly unexpected smash spectacle.<br><br>BARBIE gets a '9' rating from me.",9
" Funny, Charming, Clever & A dose of Preachy
","Clever, funny, charming with bright bold colors and visually stunning. But that is what I heard going into the film and I was not disappointed in any way in that area. The sets are also amazing and the Barbie worlds they created vs. The fake real world sets that they made; really cool.<br><br>The only part that got old fast was the preachiness of the writing. I got it the first 50 times you made it clear about feminism and that women should run everything and be everything. That is fine, but any filmmaker that keeps repeating their point or theme too much risks boring the audience by overstating or over playing your message. Many mainstream &amp; indies have made this mistake. Really likeable cast and set designs, even the music was funny &amp; clever; so a lot of good overall.",7
" Not a great movie
","The real world depicted in the movie is strangely devoid of normal people - everything looks fake and staged when Barbie goes to the real world. There are not enough extras in the real world scenes to make it look normal. I understand the filmmakers were attempting to make a statement about women's rights, etc., but it is done is such a heavy handed manner that it comes off as very forced. The costume &amp; production design plus the glitzy choreographed numbers are not enough to make up for the missing substance of Barbie's need to figure out why her life feels wrong. The scene with the ghost felt like something stolen from the Matrix where Neo visits the oracle in the kitchen. This movie was overhyped &amp; got us all to take the bait to see it &amp; it made a billion $. I feel taken and bewildered that anyone enjoyed this - the movie felt very disturbing to me in a way I can't articulate.",2
" The last act was such a redeemer. I love you, Greta! [+78%]
","My only-ever memory of a Barbie doll was the one my cousin sister once owned, and I secretly sabotaged, owing to some temporary argument in our childhood. I do remember that it was a stereotypical version, with blonde hair and a pink (or some shade of it) dress. I made that once-good-looking doll into Crazy Barbie, by drawing weird shapes on her face, pulling some of her hair out, and twisting (at least) one of her plastic limbs. I also remember hiding away some of the crockery (tea cups and the like) shortly after. Well, this film brought back that repressed memory, which I don't think I apologized to her for. Of course I did so, afterwards, and that's how rewarding the movie felt for me.<br><br>The first act of Barbie was deliberately ""plastic"", as if Gerwig was trying to reinforce the idea of how a perfectly feminine world exists. The ""Hi Barbie""s were starting to get a bit annoying, and the unabashed celebration of ""every night being girls night"", and women basically holding all decision-making power came across as Gerwing trying to impose the blunt idea that if women are involved in everything, the world automatically becomes a better place - no questions asked. When you perceive this through a man's lens, it's actually pretty brilliant. This is exactly what women must feel, at least frequently, when they see us celebrating masculinity even to toxic levels. Robbie is the perfect choice to portray stereotypical Barbie, and that's purely because she can make us feel for the character's existential crisis just as much as we can adore her looks.<br><br>The film's binding strength, however, is Ryan Gosling's Ken. As the film progressed, it almost felt like if this were a movie about Barbie questioning her existence and just fighting Mattel's idea of corporate villainy, that would've been clichéd. Ken's presence adds an intriguing layer - when he and Barbie make it to the real world, and concludes that ""men rule the real world"", he becomes the antithesis. He gathers all Kens in Barbieland and makes them acknowledge patriarchy. At this point, as much as I was entertained by Ken's antics, Barbie's realizations, and the wonderful production design, costumes, and soundtrack, I wasn't sure how Gerwig would tackle the final act. The first two acts came across as both sides being somewhat toxic, what with the sidelining of the opposite gender for no apparent reason.<br><br>But, the final act is a masterstroke. Other than Gerwig's decision NOT to fully antagonize the corporate that manufactures Barbie dolls (and their excessive product placements), because well, they co-produced it, the writing is brilliant. The fact that they allowed Gerwig to go this far itself is refreshing. It acknowledges errors on both ends, and understands how a balance is entirely significant. It asks Ken to stand on his own two feet, without having Barbie by his side always. It also pays tribute to Barbie's creator (for all her faults, including tax evasion), adding a couple of conversational scenes featuring her and Margot's Barbie that gives the latter some level of character closure. This is how you make a film based on a toy, and give it the depth it wholly deserves. Shine on, Greta! :)",8
" Clever but much too long
","The film has Margot Robbie and she's wonderful. Ryan Gossling is good but has been overhyped in this role. Will Farrell is doing his usual shtick, which is funny. However, the film seemed longer than Oppenheimer ( which is brilliant filmmaking). After twenty minutes I turned to a friend and asked if Barbie had a plot. Five minutes later a story did start to surface, but it was predicable and not terribly involving. Full disclosure: I never played with Barbie or destroyed a Barbie, so clearly I am not the intended audience. Still, there are some very clever bits, the design is super, the last line is a really laugh out loud surprise, and Robbie is a delight in anything.",6
" <3
","This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn't ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria's speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I'm so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta's work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta's movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of ""yes"" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say ""yeah that's Ryan"". Margot did a superb performance of Barbie, it is hard to play a doll that is perfect yet is experiencing an existential crisis of emotion, she deserves more praise.",10
" Entertaining, silly summer movie but not really a funny comedy
","Overall, this movie was about what I expected. It was a fun, summer blockbuster packed with stars and it felt like a nice, fresh break from all the superhero movies and rehashed stories that have been pushed out lately. It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it out<br><br>Pros:
1) best part of the movie is the soundtrack. I really liked it and the song by Billie Eilish that they played at the end has been replaying in my head ever since
2) the cast is also really good. Robbie and Gosling fit the roles perfectly and did a good job of adding layers to otherwise one-dimensional characters
3) the writing was generally pretty good, and there were several scenes that I feel like packed a decent emotional punch<br><br>Cons:
1) probably my biggest con is that the movie isn't very funny. It's written like it should be a comedy; it's silly, it's fun, and it's entertaining, but the jokes aren't that great. Even though the theatre was full, the audience was very quiet during some of the jokes. For example, Will Ferrell tried very hard, but the role he played didn't really have any good jokes to work with. The movie leaned into the silliness of its world, but seemed afraid to lean into the silliness enough in order to make a truly funny film.",7
" It's a satire
","The long-awaited and well-publicized Barbie movie is a way for Mattel to apologize for the mistakes they made, to achieve greater acceptance of the new generations, trying to imply that they are going to change those mistakes, but doing it in the best way. Form of advertising possible. Visually it is a colorful and striking film, which reminds us of many Barbie ester eggs, recalling many things from childhood (I was never really a Barbie fan). It is a friendly film for adults and children, I think that each age group will understand according to
be age. I knew that it couldn't be a bad movie since it has a very good director, luckily they decided to change the initial actress since the movie would be another story. It is a criticism using humor, about feminism, machismo, patriarchy, about what women face (I had never thought that Barbie was nominated by women, however her mistake was wanting perfectionism), about existential doubts, the world dominated by men on many occasions, the relationships of mothers and adolescents, the daily routine, trying not to fall into this routine and procrastinate, I think it is a film that, being well analyzed, has very good components and a very good plot, something that one never imagined from a movie about Barbie.",8
" I mean, Barbie is really an everything.
","As someone said, this is a bittersweet pill. A film that intends to be entertainment and toy marketing, but somehow, it brought tears out of my eyes.<br><br>I love it. I love everything about it. I love everything it represents: identity crisis, toxic masculinity, and glorifying the value of dolls. Greta Gerwig took an idea that seemed outdated, like ""Barbie,"" to tell a vivid contemporary story. At the very same time, the film also teases itself and all sorts of pop culture. And all the productions-oh my, they are all very pleasing to my eyes and ears.<br><br>Some that I'm stuck on are the half-jokes/half-seriously tone, which makes the final act not as powerful as it should be. The overexplaining of characters, when they said everything they thought but didn't really show it in another way, and Ken's arc are not completely closure to me.<br><br>In the end, Billie Eilish's song is the key to winning my heart. Man, that song and that scene are so beautiful.",7
" Started good
","The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.",3
" Actually Supports Men and Women
","This movie is an intelligence test. I saw many comments how people're describing the movie attacks men. It actually doesn't. I am a man, maybe even a stereotypical one - I loved Sigma Ken part, it was hilarious. I have a degree in Economics and love to work out in the gym, watching action movies, dark jokes, drink not cheap beers...<br><br>I believe the movie told a full of heart story how both sides (men and women) should team work more! The story perfectly told in a satirical way explains in what areas we all struggle. I won't go deep dive in because my short review doesn't contain any spoilers but trust me, the movie tries to be supportive and share a thoughtful and warm message in a fun way. It isn't woke, it doesn't treat the audience like a dumbass, it doesn't tokenise anybody, it doesn't force anything. It represents people lost in the world, trying to find their place and I think it says: Chill out.<br><br>Don't be mad. Go there with open heart and mind and have fun because I did. Ryan Gosling was fantastic.",9

Barbie is an interesting movie because its fun and clever or a gender bender in a blender at high speed .<br><br>There were numerous funny moments through the movie with good tunes playing as well that deserve some praise. Also enjoyed the playfulness of barbieworld
I believe Margot Robbie did an A plus job with combination of humor , heart and vulnerability when you subtract the cluster of the message.<br><br>Ryan/ Ken was alright could have been better calculated in movie in my opinion, I liked Will Ferrells partadds some bits of humor , maybe this movie is just a fun movie to enjoy and appreciate. Barbie is worth a watch. I honestly dont know my thoughts on the patriarchy, sexism , social issues and statements.",6
" Rubbish movie don't waste your time
","The only good things about this movie were the actors. Felt like I was watching one big commercial for Barbie constantly plugging outfits and what Barbie really means for young girls, I guess it was produced by Mattel which says a lot.<br><br>I was hoping for something smart and satirical like the Lego Movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humour.<br><br>The nostalgia is the draw card for people (including me) I loved Barbie growing up but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy this.<br><br>Dont waste your time, the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together.",1

The soundtrack should have some more elements from 80s 90s as the storyline mostly based on these years of Barbie.<br><br>Paying a tribute to Ruth was amazing but they should have also pay a tribute to the original Barbie, Bild Lilli...",10
" Creative and emotionally heavy film
","I appreciated the creative nature of the film and applaud breaking out of the formulaic box. Having said that, there are still narratives present in the film that are prominent in todays culture. Gender Identity is still a common theme which plays out on a multitude of levels in the film. I am not an academic and probably can't articulate the intellectual philosophies the movie contained.<br><br>As a woman who played with Barbies as a child, I hold this beloved icon to high esteem. The concept of Barbie seems like a convenient path to drive many of these political narratives in general. Personally, I think it would be even harder to make a regular movie for young girls with Barbie as the main character.<br><br>Ryan Gosling in an amazing actor. I feel like he stole the show as Ken. I enjoyed the singing and dancing numbers the most. Most of the movie was very heavy handed emotionally. I would have preferred different casting in Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrel's roles. Different actors would have brought a fresher take in general. Margo Robbie was amazing as Barbie. The sets were ok.<br><br>Overall I would not go out of my way to see the movie again. If RyannGosling does another musical comedy I will definitely see it!",6
" Greta Gerwig One of the Most Unique Voices in Hollywood
","What a cinematic experience. The mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination. I don't know where to start. I feel like Greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in Hollywood. This film is iconic. Using the character and icon of Barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do. Throughout the film I was always connecting it to Disney's Soul, due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message (Barbie experiencing the real life for the first time): life is unique, a beautiful gift that it's worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering - using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics, patriarchy, feminism, life as a woman in all its aspects, all in a really enjoyable, beautifully crafted comedic way. Barbie (and the married writers) manages to unite different kinds of genres (musical - Ryan Gosling is sublime in musicals... you know what I mean -, bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer) in a special way. This movie is near to perfection. The epilogue really adds to that perfection, with a heart-wrenching soundtrack by Billie Eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by Margot Robbie. It's her year, and she deserves all of it. To summarise the film: I AM KENOUGH!",9
" It was good but it could have been better.
","I'm only saying it could have been better because of the hype. I was expecting a little more and was a little disappointed by some aspects of the film. Firstly I'll say that Margot as Barbie and Ryan as Ken were great individually. A large part of why this movie was so good is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen. I found watching Ken discovering ""patriarchy"" to be the most hilarious part of the film. However, one of the first critiques I have is that it felt like the movie didn't spend enough time in Barbieland. The serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the ""perfect"" life a little more and the character dynamics of the barbies and Kens. This also would have made me personally feel more like I care as a viewer regarding the emotions and thoughts that Barbie and Ken were experiencing when they went to the real world. Secondly, it's use of heavily weighted political words being used loosely by the barbies and kens water down the overall issue this film is trying to be about. I think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed. Or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate. I understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone, and it was. However, it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used. It just felt, in my personal opinion, to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message. Finally, which brings me to my third critique, is that the movie didn't seem to be for kids but at the same time it was? My first argument for why perhaps the two critiques I have made might not be valid is because it's a kids film, and in that sense it would, well, make sense. But then there was the use of heavy political language used throughout the movie that just wouldn't be useful for a storyline in which kids can get the message, not to mention literal sexual reference made to female and male gentilia which seemed inappropriate for children. Don't get me wrong, I love when kids movies throw in a little something subtle for adults to obviously get a giggle at, which I argue Shrek did very well for example. However, the script of this movie (I'm not speaking of visuals for obvious reasons) just seemed a little confused in which age group it was catering too. Which arguably limited itself in diving deeper into the above two points I made.<br><br>Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film and good in its own merits. Ken as a character made a lot of sense given his whole purpose as a doll in real life. And that essence I think they captured well. 7/10.",7
" Barbie rocks!
","Finally got around to viewing this, and it was really great fun. A solid story. It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.<br><br>Margo Robbie pretty much owns this movie, and rightly so. She and Ryan Gosling take over the screen and must of had a load of fun.<br><br>The set design is very inventive and is very pivotal to the films plot. Never seen so many high heels in a mainstream movie. So many great costumes that help along with the pop background.<br><br>Really silly and funny look at life, very metaphoric, plenty of fun here, the screening was full, just 6 seats left.",8
" I think I set the bar too high, it unfortunately fell flat for me
","I'm guinely sad to say this movie fell incredibly flat in my opinion. There was no spark, a film trying to do what it was trying to accomplish needed that spark to make it get it to where it was trying to go! It felt as if it was missing that connection the audience/viewers want to receive and feel from beginning to end, forgetting you're watching a movie, that spark that makes you get lost in the story in a best kind of way. I had beyond high hopes for this film. I was truly ecstatic to see it, and was rooting for it every step of the way... all the way till I stood up from my theater seat as the credits rolled. I had this glooming feeling of confusion(not because I did not get it) and unfulfillment. I literally felt bad for wanting to immediately turn to my sister, whose birthday it was, and ask her what she thought because I knew I'd than have to answer that same question to not only her but to everyone else that was going to ask me what I thought. The trailers and hype around it presented it as if it was going to be a hilarious and powerful satire indie film that would go down in cinema history. Yes it had an incredibly outstanding lineup cast, inspiring director and writers, but it was just not all it was hyped up to be. I'm definitely in the target audience, so there's no judgment that should be passed on that thought, I just wasn't that captured by it. This is all MY PERSONAL OPINION, but I did not find it funny, I literally caught myself forcing laughter at some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny because I felt bad the jokes were just not landing, and I really did want to like it. It felt alittle all over the place at times, and rushed in multiple scenes that felt there should have been more there. Yes, there was alot of great speeches that were moving, but sometimes it felt like there were so many it took away from others and you got lost in all the underlying meanings. It felt like someone was saying ""look over here, now over here, no back over here!"" The cast was good, visually appealing, and unique, but the movie as a whole just felt lacking. There was substance, but it got lost in all the messages and lessons it wanted us to take from it. Not something I would just put on to watch multiple times. It's a ""once is enough for me"" type of film. I got the message loud and clear, I just felt no connection was able to be made the way the story was told. Maybe if we got to explore the characters more and build that connection to feel one with the film.",6
" Bitter sweet movie
","Firstly I'll say that I'm the movie's target audience: a female in her 20s. Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won't give spoilers but in this ""perfect"" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances. Some scenes were also very funny but personally I did not like the ending.",2
" Well deserving of the hype
","This is the first time I've written a review for a movie, that should tell you that I enjoyed this movie an awful lot.<br><br>The storyline grabbed my attention at every corner and the soundtrack continues to ring in my ears and evoke a feeling of confidence in myself and pure joy. It really focused in on it's female audience and was able to accurately portray the modern day plight of the average woman. I didn't expect to cry during this movie but I had never felt so understood and empowered to be myself.<br><br>Margot Robbie was Barbie, she managed to uphold the whimsy and joy of Barbie throughout the tough political statements that with any other actress would have depressed the audience. Ryan Gosling never failed to make me laugh in his role as Ken, he was perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else fulfilling it to the same standard. The supporting Barbies and Kens also excelled in their roles adding to the character and world of Barbie.<br><br>I have spent some time reading other reviews which have complained that the 3rd portion of the movie was too heavy handed in its feminist perspective and that its blunt political message didn't properly encapsulate Barbie. To that I say; The 3rd portion is less than 40 minutes long, if you can't listen to women's issues for that little time without getting bored then maybe you're not getting what we're saying. And this movie was actually about Barbie, unlike the animated Barbie movies which merely starred Barbie. This movie is actually about Barbie and her extensive history as a controversial doll that had to fight tooth and nail to make it into the hands of little girls and inspire them to be more than mothers.<br><br>Overall, Barbie was incredible and I hope she inspires even more little girls through this movie than she already has.",10
" Good jokes and a disappointing Ending
",At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.,6
" I went in with low expectations...
","What would make a grown man watch 'Barbie'? I've been asking myself this since I heard about the release of this live-action Barbie film. Isn't this just for girls who idolize Barbie dolls, or women who have fond memories of playing with Barbie dolls? You have to immerse yourself in a girl's world to fully understand the film.<br><br>I guess it was the hype that prompted me to watch 'Barbie'. In the opening narration, the film explains why the Barbie dolls became such a phenomenon and I found this interesting. I never thought about it (maybe because I didn't play with dolls!!), but the Barbie dolls were apparently the first adult dolls on the market. All other dolls prior to Barbie were baby dolls. Interesting.<br><br>Margot Robbie stars as Stereotypical Barbie. Yes, it does get confusing, because ALL the females are called Barbie and ALL the men are called Ken. Ryan Gosling stars as (stereotypical) Ken, and might I say he is looking mighty fine! Ryan is in excellent shape and would indeed make me want to play with him...erm, the doll, I mean...oh, whatever...<br><br>Back to the movie. So, the Barbies and the Kens live in harmony in the perfect world of Barbieland. Life is a party and they're all blissful. Until Barbie starts having thoughts of death - a thought that never crossed their minds before. Barbie then starts to malfunction, and is ordered by Weird Barbie to go to the real world to find out who is playing with her. Ken decides to join her on her journey and so these 'dolls' enter the real world.<br><br>Something you have to keep in mind when watching 'Barbie' is that it is made in the way girls would play with their dolls. It does not follow a similar narration to most movies out there. I think many viewers might not understand this concept. I honestly went in with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining I found the film. Ok, then having said that, I enjoyed the first two acts far more than the third act.<br><br>For me, it felt like the film fell apart during the third act. It became a mess in a way, slapstick, and also far too feminist. Fair enough, this is about girl dolls, but for me as a man it became offensive in a way. I also believe this could send out a very wrong message to girls. If it wasn't for the chaotic final act, I would have enjoyed the film much better as a whole.<br><br>One has to admire the film's incredible production design. I predict 'Barbie' will receive an Oscar nomination for Best Production Design. The sets are beautiful and colourful, as if toys came to life. I also thought Margot Robbie was well cast as Barbie. Ryan Gosling is far too good an actor for the rather silly role of Ken, and I believe any actor would have sufficed as Ken.",5
" It's Barbie
",I never cared for Barbie but the movie is really good I think the casting is perfect and the music and who they got to do the soundtrack I also love how they made the Barbie world a separate land and it was brighter then the whole world and I love how they went to the Mattel head quarters and the people trying to take her away and Barbie and Ken being in the real In the real world also the marketing team did amazing on the promo and advertisement on the movie with all the company's collab with Barbie and etc so overall the Barbie movie got a lot of hype and well deserved excellent film and amazing for people who love barbie.,10
" Its Good but not Great!
","I went in there with O expectations, but boy, it was cunning and audacious to say the least! It is one the most original movie made in terms of writing, filming, cinematography, in recent times to be made with a fake subject but very relevant plot!<br><br>Barbie speaks to alot of women and
MEN about feminism, patriarchy, consumerism and existentialism in its own weird, sometimes cringe but mostly funny way.<br><br>Full Marks for Casting. Top to toe perfect casting for Barbie and Ken. But movié is boring in the beginning and too preachy otherwise.<br><br>Totally skippable in the theatres. Its not worth the hype tbh.",6
" Speechless
","Words cannot express successfully how I feel about this movie. I want to first say how important this movie is for women in the industry. As a woman who's dream is to be a filmmaker and being so young this is a monumental achievement in my eyes. This movie has made me excited to see what younger minds can do. It has a wonderful creative voice and a beautiful mix of comedy and respectfully addresses hard topics in a way that I think everyone can benefit from. I can understand how some people find it preachy but I disagree because this is a love letter to women. There are so many things that stuck with me and I will probably remember forever. I am impressed with the amount or detail, creativity, and love that was so obviously put into this movie. Greta Gerwig and the rest of the production team did a beautiful job creating an immersive thought provoking experience that brought me to tears. This is by far Margot and Ryan's best performance I've seen and they deserve all the love for it. The sci-fi references are also a very interesting touch that I didn't expect. I think this is a movie than everyone can take something away from and it is very special to me.",10
" Barbie Is A Great Movie, Locked In A Plastic Box
","Oppenheimer was bad. In a bad way. And when I reviewed it, I was thought everything would have been better to watch than that. And finally, I had the opportunity to watch Barbie. I thought it will be a tipical advert film, where yes, they make joke from the dolls and there's some jokes for the adults too, but overall it's all about: BUY MORE BARBIE !<br><br>And I had almost right. But just ALMOST.<br><br>Barbie tries to be a society critic, an advert film, a comedy, a kids movie, and it almost works well in those types. But there are some bad things I want to discuss, so here's how this critic will work, I will show how it fits in the types I written down, and after that I will write the conclusion.<br><br>Society Critic Part: The movie absolutely great in this type, it both shows the stupidity of the PC world, and the terrifying fact we live in a world where is homophobia and racism, sexism. Most of the jokes are about that.<br><br>Advert Film Part: Exactly because the Society Critic part, it fails to be a good advert film, because who do you want to want to get Barbies. Small Children! And small children will not understand, the jokes with our society, they understand the slapstick jokes. Okay there's some in the film. But there's too few to interest a child.<br><br>Comedy Part: It's good. This movie IS funny. I can't say more.<br><br>Kids Movie Part: As I said, it's not working that much. But I have to tell, it can be a bit too silly for adults. So that's a problem too.<br><br>Conclusion: It's a good movie ! Watch it max two times, great stuff. But if it wasn't a Barbie movie, it could work better.",6
" Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites
","Barbie wasn't supposed to be that deep but it was. Greta Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites to write this story down with so much boldness, creativity, and awareness that no one could ever imagine for an already perfect plastic to deserve.<br><br>It wasn't a surprise Margot Robbie could kill this role and make us all believe she was born for this because she was. She is my favorite actress after all. She led the film as perfectly as her Barbie but it was Ryan Gosling that took me by surprise with how much he embodied kenergy that came so explosive like some atomic bomb designed by some civilian scientist (pun intended). Then there's America Ferrera (watch out for the scenes that earned her the ""heart of the film"" ribbon) and the scene Billie Eilish's ""What Was I Made For"" was made for. (If I were to predict with all confidence who's bagging an Oscar nomination? It's Billie for Original Song.)<br><br>Barbie indeed subverted expectations and stereotypes. And I hate that it worked, that's why I loved it.",8

","First half was very enjoyable, but the rest felt rushed and with no direction. Like it didn't really know what to focus on.<br><br>I loved the music and choreography, the scenography was amazing and I genuinely laughed a couple times.<br><br>Ken bringing patriarchy to Barbieland and screwing things up is a fun and interesting concept. Although, I feel like the plot turned simplistic and took the easy way out. I don't buy the ""Nah, everything was perfect before, let's get things exactly as they were"".<br><br>The dialogues sometimes want to be this emotional speeches that kinda take me out, it doesn't feel like a natural progression. As it is often said, it was too much ""tell"" and too little ""show"".",6

When generic Barbie begins having thoughts about death and experiencing flat feet she has journey to the real world, accompanied by tag along, wannabe boyfriend Ken.<br><br>Revealing much more of the story would be a bit of a spoiler given how well the marketing has kept the nitty gritty of precedings hidden but it's safe to say the ensuing story is possibly the most meta film ever made. It comments on Barbie's place in the world, some ""interesting"" missteps Matel has made with the doll, and the irony of the company having an all male board before you even get to the feminist and class culture stuff. Even the movie's casting is meta. Having Margot Robbie, the embodiment of blonde perfection , as Barbie adds an extra layer to the notion of unobtainable beauty and Ryan Gosling is genius casting as Ken, the ""sigma male"" persona certain corners of the Internet have bestowed upon him being completely flipped on its head. It obviously helps that they are both outstanding actors. The rest of the cast are also great, the denizens of Barbie Land perfectly playing out the ridiculousness of the situation without ever winking at camera and Will Ferrell in one of his best roles in years as the oddball Mattel CEO.<br><br>Director Greta Gerwig performs a miraculous juggling act, balancing some fairly weighty themes with real belly laughs and somehow managing to keep a consistent tone across the most surreal two hours ever to gross over a billion dollars. It does pack a surprising emotional punch in some parts as well. There is one sequence, when they first reach the real world and Ken becomes aware of all the opportunies and positive stereotypes that men see every day, that as the father of a teenage girl was a real gut punch and one of the most subtlety effective depictions of modern day sexism you will see. The only real missteps Barbie makes are when it attempts to be too sentimental, a couple of more schmaltzy scenes feel overdone and the movie makes it's points more than adequately without them.<br><br>Mainly though, the film is just very, very funny, a blast of refreshing pink air into the blockbuster scene and a fun time for everyone.<br><br>8 horse out of 10 mojo dojo casa houses.",8
" Original, colorful, and fun
","Barbie opens with an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey before quickly transitioning to the visually stunning, artificial reality of Barbieland, where the sky is a painting and the food imagined. It's colorful, the set designers display fully realized artistic visions-it's nice to see a movie that isn't over sanitized for a mass audience, a movie that doesn't play it safe. You can see the influences Greta Gerwig wanted to include from old Hollywood all over the place. Margot Robbie is the star as Barbie, fully embodying the perfect Barbie life until cracks start to form in Barbieland.<br><br>Barbie presents two dystopian worlds, one a bad version of the real world, and Barbieland, where men are pushed aside and given nothing to do at all. Ken discovers the idea of the patriarchy after being respected for the first time in his life in the real world because he never had any power. It was a desperate attempt to gain equality from a member of the oppressed class. Ken is essential to the emotional core of the film. He's how we see the injustice of Barbieland. The movie isn't man-hating, it uses the poor treatment of the Kens by the Barbies to say how dumb discrimination is and that we should all treat each other as individuals, capable of working within our individual talents and skills and that we should be authentic to who we are.<br><br>** Significant spoilers after this point**<br><br>The movie also tells us through a memorable monologue from Gloria (thanks to America Ferrera's excellent performance) that we don't have to be perfect, we can embrace being ordinary. She doesn't want the perfect Barbie life either, she wants an ordinary Barbie that's also a mom, loves her family, and embraces her imperfections as good things. The concern with insecurity caused by Barbie is made less tactfully by Gloria's daughter who goes on a screed calling Barbie a fascist (you can't tell me this was intended to be self serious and not a way to poke fun at Gen Z self righteousness).<br><br>Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie also learns these values, shown when she is sitting at the bus stop in the real world and looks over at the older woman next to her and tells her she is beautiful. Barbie sees beyond the plastic perfection of Barbieland. This is why it's so important she leaves Barbieland at the end of the film, she rejects the reimposed female domination of Barbieland and the point of the film is to say the real world is better than what women may imagine happens in Barbieland. Barbieland is not the good place.<br><br>There were some significant negatives for me though. I thought the movie had some humor that fell very flat in parts. The scenes at Mattel didn't do much for me. The movie was at its weakest in the real world (where we spent a lot of time). Some of the characters had rushed development.<br><br>I am Kenough.",7

A message that Ryan Gosling had in a great performance to emphasize the perspective that unfortunately still reigns in many men today.<br><br>Speaking of the cast, Ryan Gosling had a script that favored him, with several scenes and different roles that allowed him to show all his versatility as an actor, and the reality is that he delivered a high-level performance, the best in the film imo, and that he managed not only to give strength to the message that he wanted to convey, but also to elevate the film to another level with his musical performances. On the other hand, imo, Margot had a script that didn't exploit all of his acting skills. Don't get me wrong, her acting is very good, within what was provided, the performance is very good, however I think the script could have given her more, due to the versatility she has!<br><br>And my first negative point is precisely that.

It's a shame, because there are really good speeches!<br><br>Finally, the message got across clearly and the most important thing is clearly retained. This movie was never about pink or a doll. It was about women and the rights they are due! Respect, freedom, and justice in relation to the opportunities they should have. Doors should open according to the work carried out and the skills demonstrated, never to the gender or color of a person! Love is love no matters what. Respect is to everyone, there's no ""but""! However, I think Greta missed an incredible opportunity to make a stronger ""statement"" about equal rights, duties and opportunities for all!<br><br>In short, it's a good film, light, funny and entertaining, and can be watched several times as something to ""pass the time and have fun"" but should be watched, at least once, in a serious and dedicated way for all the message it has!",6
" What I expected and more from Greta's Barbie Movie
","I Will keep this as spoiler free as possible. When I heard Greta Gerwig was directing the Barbie movie. I was instantly excited to the fear of everyone around me. I would tell them ""Greta Gerwig wouldn't do a superficial Barbie movie it would be more, it would have message."" To my surprise it was all of that and more! It was funny and clever. It showed the problems with Barbie (the toy) but also the dreams for Barbie for young girls. It was campy in the best way. And America Ferrera's monologue deserved a standing ovation and I even teared up a few times. So please ignore the low dumb reviews and go see the movie and make up your own opinions. At least for me it was delight to be seen and I hope you feel the same.",10
" Life in plastic, it stops short of being fantastic
","The real power of cinema came to the forefront as two films went head to head against one another this Friday. One was based on a childhood icon that attained the status of a cultural phenomenon over the years as evident from the massive craze around it and the other was based on an icon in the realm of science whose invention changed the course of the world and was directed by a man who has emerged as a phenomena himself in the world of cinema. The former celebrates girl power and inclusivity while the latter is largely a man's world built on a critique of warfare and corrupt politics. To address the elephant in the room, ""Oppenheimer"" beats ""Barbie"" on all fronts without having to put up much of a fight, irrespective of what the box office figures might denote.<br><br>That said, ""Barbie"" is a good film, a fun watch, that could have been so much more. The first half was a joyride providing all the fun that the film must have intended to provide during the course of its runtime. It was a job well done by the art directors and set designers as they enabled in creating a vibrant, colourful world without any trace of morbidity. The Barbie houses, the beach, the house of the Weird Barbie, the roads, the Netherlands-like fields, the sea - they were created with a perfection that one can only dream of, only to let you sink and immerse yourselves in the colours that Gerwig's vision could have borrowed straight of the rainbow. To conceptualize and execute such a world is an extraordinary accomplishment with the sets perfectly complementing the colourful lives of our Barbies. The Barbies come from all walks of life, hold important positions, and stay at the frontline of Barbie life - a contrast to the human world where a bigshot at a top private firm claims to Ken that they don the mask of inclusivity so that they do not have to deal with a backlash. At the center of all these Barbies is Margot Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie who is ever joyful and unfettered by emotions like grief or anxiety. She is the paragon of the beauty as it was once envisioned, hence the stereotype about her. The Kens have nothing much to do in this world other than bicker over their vulnerabilities. All was well until the real world began messing with the Barbie world and our protagonist is hit by concerning thoughts like death. Depression takes root in her mind and she has to embark on a journey to the real world to not only fix her own life but also that of her owner. ""Barbie"" should have stopped here or should have taken an alternate route to the denouement as the second half just steers out of control and every theme seemed to being heavily hammered into youe mind as if the script had lost confidence in the viewer to effortlessly let those ideas in. The last 30 minutes felt stretched out of control except for the incredibly done Ken song - one of my favourite moments from the film. Gerwig had let the viewers have most of the fun in the first hour but the script lost the steam as it trudged to the finish line. Gerwig is worthy appreciation for her vision, for the world she has accomplished in this film, for the infinite ideas she has established - feminism to motherhood to inclusivity to bending all gender stereotypes. She has been sensitive and empathetic in her handling of depression. If only she had not taken the approach of a moral parable in the second half this film could have been so much better.<br><br>""Barbie"" packs in a stellar cast with every single one of them investing the best of their qualities in the project. Robbie looks absolutely pretty as she should have in this role and handles joy, sadness, existential crisis with the capability that she as an actor has always possessed. Issa Rae as President Barbie and Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie are two other standouts. But the real star of the show is Ryan Gosling - his Ken-ergy is infectious and will keep you in splits throughout. Just look at his incredible comedic chops when Ken visits the human world. You just can't have Ken-ough of Gosling's Ken. ""La La Land"" showed that he could dance really well, a skill he has put effectively to use in the Ken song too.<br><br>In the end, Gerwig's film is a pretty looking tribute to a pretty cultural phenomena. It could have had a little more of the ""muchness"" (as the Mad Hatter would say in ""Alice in Wonderland"") in the fun department. It dazzles throughout but the baggage of its heavy-handedness drags it down to an extent. Alas!",7
" How does the Barbie movie have good ratings? How?!
","First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews. It must me a new way to market films - pay a whole bunch of people to talk it up and write good reviews on social media, and then you'll get the crowds on opening weekend. You've been warned.",1
" For all those gingerly skirting around an existential crisis
","This movie touches on complex themes the way the Truman show and West World were able to do but in a way that was more glittery and a bit more superficial. Because it juxtaposes a world that was created in the imagination of women (Barbieland) vs. Men (the real world), it has a bit of a devastating conclusion for both: mainly that people struggle to live up to ideals, resulting in feelings of alienation and depression that they try to hide. What I appreciated so much about the movie was its commentary on men feeling like they need a ""Barbie"" at their side to feel successful. It occurred in Barbieland but honestly it was a commentary on both men and women who feel that way in both worlds. It's easier to think that someone else will help us determine why we are here instead of really exploring who we are and what our purpose is as individuals. There's a loneliness that rung so true at the heart of the Ken experience. Curious what men thought of it and if they could relate.<br><br>Set design and visual humor were awesome. Everyone played their role with a lot of heart. My soon to be 11 year old daughter loved it as well. It was just wonderfully entertaining.",10
" Margot Robbie and Ryang Gosling. That's it.
",Gosling Robbie Made the movie. They're what makes it worthy to Watch. Every other possible meaning or message the director was aiming to Explore in the film was pointless or superficially / weakly face. Mattel tried so hard to wash its image through out Barbie's redemption that it almost appears cringe. Will Ferrell in the Same Role as he was in Zoolander or so. Finally the male figure is a bad represantation of the worst and stereotypical patriarchy which you could assist to maybe in the 80s. Despite Goslin's brilliant represantation Ken is just a stupid mamma boy without any merit. Robbie is just wonderful.,6
" Hollywood Films have got so bad this is considered good ???!!!
","THE GOOD ... Its bright and colourful ... Rhea Pearlman shows genuine heart ... Helen Mirren is fine as the narrator ... THE BAD ... I didn't laugh once, this is a complete wet rag as a comedy, in fact it is not better than an epitome of mediocrity in all departments and it is embarrassingly over sentimental in places ... ... The music is dreadful, you can't tell one piece from another ... If this is what studio writers are thinking is creative these days , then the fact is they are wrong and at least as regards Hollywood, AI probably could do better and you should sack the lot of them ... You need to learn that if you write stuff to satisfy the cultures ALL around the world and not upset anyone in the slightest, then you write stuff that doesn't satisfy anyone ... This had immense possibilities, but instead turned out to be a geriatric Barbie who had lost her dentures.",3
" (SPOILER-FREE) - It's Only What You Bring With You
","Let's face it: this film is not supposed to be good. It certainly isn't supposed to offer much more than eye-candy and a few songs. Yet, 'Barbie' in its own way has come to house all the pieces we look for in a movie. For her first live-action story, Greta Gerwig managed to craft an experience that captures everything right, and everything wrong with what the doll has represented to generations of girls. Set design was a dream and at opening feels like the first time we saw Dorothy step into Oz. The cast carried a full load of heavy-hitters and Gosling's Ken made a few attempts to steal the show. Margot Robbie is the true star that shines as she gives much more attention, depth, and charisma than Barbie had any right to be - creating a 3D character that is both whimsical and disturbingly real. Although it is an entirely different think-piece to discuss gender roles, the fact remains that any authentic Barbie story cannot be told without it. Gerwig's real genius is that she is able to tell the story within the story without it feeling like a finger-wag. The fact is, the pacing and humor is more than enough for viewers to see themselves on both sides of the fence. Cunning, sharp, heartfelt, and hilarious, 'Barbie' is an open love letter to past, present, and future mothers and the ties that bind through the obligation of perfection. In the end - like its namesake - the film represents whatever you want it to be. After all, isn't that what she was made for?",8
" It is what it is
","Barbie is a fun little movie that is, at its core, a satire on traditional gender roles in society. Thrown in is some mild commentary on materialism and how reality seldom (if ever) lives up to our youthful expectations. Some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive anti-male agenda but I can't see it that way. It's simply a movie, based on a toy, that dares to actually not take itself seriously. Look at other films in this genre such as Battleship, GI Joe and the Transformers films. All take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark ""realism"". Barbie doesn't do that. It reveals that it's a joke in the very first scene.<br><br>Is this a great movie? Absolutely not. But it is fun, entertaining summertime fluff. Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both look and act perfectly plastic. The set design is brilliantly colorful and the whole thing moves at a pleasant pace. See it and enjoy.",6
" Best movie of the year
","I really enjoyed the movie, but it also tore me to pieces. I saw myself reflected in many very difficult situations in my life as a woman, beyond the fact that my feminism allows me to be aware of many things. I got home thinking a lot.<br><br>Margot Robbie's performance is incredible, it really makes you feel all the sadness, despair and finally the relief of being a real and imperfect woman. Ken was also very good, I feel that Gosling is going to win an Oscar.<br><br>Separate point for the costumes, scenarios, makeup excellently done. Barbie is undoubtedly the movie of the year 2023. In short, watch it. It's a great movie. Thank you thank you thank you.",9
" I'm Happy because of Cinema not Movie!
","First of all, let me say that my score for this movie is 6.5, but thanks to the site, I cannot give this vote.<br><br>I agree that this movie conveys a good message and concept, but I seriously don't know why it sold so much, but am I sad? Not at all. It makes me very happy that the movie was able to sell so much after Marvel's superhero movies.all actors have fully understood the concept of the film and good enough. I did not see this movie in the cinema, but I am happy that it made many people go to the cinema and see this movie. In the end, in this time with this movie everything is for the benefit of cinema.",6
" Wonderful
","Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.<br><br>Jam packed with in-jokes, sly references and even a Mattel-censored F-bomb, Barbie is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. Most of the satire will fly over kids' heads, as we had a theatre-full of Belgrave's finest letting their vile offspring literally run riot under the screen.<br><br>Luckily, the movie was so good we kept our teacher voices to ourselves. Over to Oppenheimer on Sunday. 9/10.",9
" what to expect
","Me and my sister both enjoyed this film and disliked it. The beginning of the film starts off with little girls destroying baby dolls because the new ""barbie toy"" had been created. Me and my sister were shocked and also disappointed in the scene. The movie was really funny, it had us laughing a lot and we enjoyed it. They made men look absolutely stupid, as in if there was just one leadership position filled by a man it was the end of the world. That part annoyed us and we strongly disagreed w it. Overall, i think that the movie could have been better, but it wasn't the worst i've ever seen. I definitely enjoyed certain moments of watching the film, but definitely not every moment. I recommend this film for the barbie world experience. I think every actor/actress fulfilled the role they played. However i don't think that the story was 100% in line and think it could have been a bit better. :)",7
" Wonderfull setup, with a not so wonderfully excecuted message
","The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.<br><br>But the message of ""patriarchy is bad"" seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively, with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men, and i dont believe in battling hate with hate. Dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering (world dominated by men), but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal, which the barbie word is. Pinning us against each other is not helpful, as we should work together to reach equality, one cannot work without the other. What could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste.",3
" Be what you want to be
","Ryan Gosling as Ken I loved too much, but Margot Robbie as Barbie is perfect.<br><br>I understood the message very well, it's great to see how they destroy little by little the stereotypes of a ""pretty"" person and replace it with the reality that many human beings live. And after all, men and women (and every living being) deserve to be happy.<br><br>One of the scenes I loved, aside from the opening reference, is the ""Just Ken Exclusive"" scene. I would have loved to see more of Ken!!!! And don't forget that you can be whatever you want to be.<br><br>By the way, I absolutely hated the advertising to a certain car brand.",8
" 6.9 - better than what most people told me
","Yes its a Barbie which means it will be on par with the animated movies (having a lead character and the story revolving around her), but when I put it on my, the acquired humor caught me unexpectedly and the movie had a few high points and it somehow, for god knows what reasons, kept my interest.<br><br>The conflict part which started when Ken was introduced to the men world was pure comedy. The whole KenLand was pure comedy and imo probably the best part.<br><br>On the other hand, I also wasn't a fan of how they the BarbieLand was essentially controlled by you know who, but it was exactly the opposite of what happens in real world so yeah if what happens in the real world, being rules by men, is justifiable then yes BarbieLand practices are also right.<br><br>On a whole a good small giggly movie but not worth a rewatch.",6
" Who exactly is the target audience for this film?
","Greta Gerwig has had a hit or miss career. Her film Little Women was fairly entertaining, but I found her film Lady Bird to be completely obnoxious. Same goes for Margot Robbie. I enjoyed her in Wolf Of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, but really disliked I Tonya and Birds of Prey.<br><br>Now comes Barbie, based on the long running series of dolls from Mattel. Now as a guy, I never played with Barbies prefering to play video games over dolls, however my sisters enjoyed playing them and that's the question about this film. Who is the target audience for this film? Because on one hand it looked like a film designed for sixty year old women who never got over playing with their dolls and on another hand, its advertising is aimed at little girls even though some of the material maybe offensive to a lot of families.<br><br>The plotline, which is extremely thin, involves Barbie living the perfect life in Barbieland where Barbie dolls of all types live and where all the Kens hang out at the beach, Then all of a sudden Barbie escapes to the real world where she is treated like a dog really hammering home Greta Gerwig's misandry.<br><br>I can see this film having a decent opening weekend but expect it to drop like a rock in the following weeks when people realize this film is really just a one trick pony. The pink sets look nice but the screenplay and the annoying script are definitely going to divide audiences and this film really doens't have mainstream appeal at all. Most of all Will Farrel as the CEO of Mattel is about as annoying as ever and the misanderyt stereotypes are about entertaining as watching paint dry.<br><br>A one on a scale of 1-10. Save yourself the headache and see the much better Oppenheimer instead!",1
" ""This Barbie is far from plastic. It's fantastic"".
","I finally had the chance to watch the wonderful Barbie movie, and I must say, it did not disappoint me at all. In fact, it surpassed my expectations! Barbie turned out to be much more than what I initially imagined-it's truly remarkable!<br><br>One thing I really liked was how Greta addressed all the criticisms about Barbie while infusing a feminist twist into the doll (Barbie was the first doll which had power of chosing). Gerwig's take on childhood and the patriarchy and feminism and love and death resonated throughout the film, adding an extra layer of depth and thought-provoking themes. I found myself both shedding a few tears and laughing heartily. The movie was incredibly humorous and touched upon meaningful aspects of life.<br><br>I took my 11-year-old niece to see it, and she loved it too (although I'm sure some of the social points might have gone over her head).<br><br>The sets, hair, and costumes were absolutely outstanding. The cast delivered stunning performances: America Ferrera gave a deeply moving speech, and Ryan Gosling's performance stole the show, proving many, myself included, wrong about his suitability for the role.<br><br>Lastly, I must mention Margot Robbie, who was simply stunning and the perfect fit for Barbie. She was naive, sweet, and camp, all wrapped up in a ""stereotypical Barbie"". Although Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer were previously associated with the project, I am delighted that Margot Robbie made it happen.<br><br>""This Barbie is far from plastic. It's fantastic"".",10
" ""Stereotypical Barbie"" in a Stereotypical Movie
","First, the good bits. I thoroughly enjoyed the cast, even got to see some favorites in semi-major roles. For a blockbuster movie like this, good acting is to be expected. I also, as many fellow viewers pointed out, enjoyed the intricacies that made the movie seem like it was scripted by a kid. That was the whole point with the floating and dramatics-things that can only happen in imagination actually happen in the movie.<br><br>Now, while I enjoyed the movie and didn't see it as preachy at all-in fact, I think it did a great job of saying what Barbie stood for if it wasn't a perfect woman no girl could become-it could've been better. The plot, while purposely childlike, seemed rushed and half-finished towards the end. Without going to a means of spoiling, I wished for better character development and realism in stead of useless scenes that did nothing but spotlight good looks and physique. This movie COULD'VE been a transformational experience along the lines of ""when perfect isn't good enough."" I really just got a couple rounds of laughs, some nods of approval, and mere silence looking at a movie that even it didn't know where it was going.<br><br>TL;DR - It's a good movie-not a great movie.",7
" The most magical pink fever dream
","I had no idea what to expect, but the trailers made me smile. Every after the seeing the trailers the movie was so much more weird and wonderful and pink than I'd even imagined. I laughed so hard. There is also a sweet message about the pressures of life and society and gender roles without being preachy. It feels like a message of kindness to ourselves and to others. I now know that I am Kenough.<br><br>The writing of this film was brilliant. It could have been a strange and tacky film; but instead it reminded us of the endless possibilities of stories and imaginations. The music, costumes, sets and actors all were the perfect pink sprinkles on top.",10
" Fun movie
","Barbie is, in its very core, a comedy, and a funny one at that. From the opening scene, Greta Gerwig set up the mood that will run thru the entire movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both amazing, but the rest of the big ensemble is a mixed bag. This is mostly because of the writing. Will Ferrells character served no more purpose than advertise the Mattel company as goofy and ""self aware"". The third act slows the movie down, which is a shame as the first and second acts are very strong. However, when Barbie delivers it delivers. The set design are beautifully artificial. Barbie sometimes shows strokes of genius, but fails to deliver a strong end.",7
" It was amazing
","I loved to watch the movie, it had all elements one would have want to have seen. The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.",10
" No reason to be a hater
","I was excited to see this movie after hearing how much people liked it. I anticipated it having strong messages and it did, but it was a little all over the place. I'm not sure there actually was a cohesive message, but I found myself very emotional at moments during this film. I think it speaks to both men and women who feel societal pressures to be certain things and act certain ways. The music is amazing, and the Ken dance sequence might have been my favorite thing I have seen at the movies this year. This movie is also hilarious throughout. I left not knowing exactly how I was meant to feel, but I did enjoy all the pieces even if they didn't come together completely.<br><br>Does NOT need a sequel or a Mattel cinematic universe! Lol.",7
" Not for me.
","I was thinking that Barbie was going to be a light hearted family movie.....it is not. You don't want to take the kids to this movie. I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype. I just don't understand why they can't seem to make enjoyable movies that transport you away anymore.",2
" APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY -- years ahead of its time
","Barbie is absolutely brilliant! Studio executives would do well to grasp the fundamental reason for its success -- speaking truth to the viewer's subconscious psychology. I have yet to see a single review which acknowledges this, presumably because psychology and political rhetoric (from both sides) are received with equal disdain in contemporary American society -- despite the reality that psychology is a valid modern science.<br><br>Barbie poses fundamental questions of:
""who am I?""
""Why do I identify myself as something?""
""What causes me to feel the way I do?""<br><br>Greta Gerwig is phenomenally genius in anthrapamorphizing these and other human psychological issues onto the inanimate object of a plastic doll. It is analogous to an adult version of Pinocchio. This far exceeds the psychological expression for which Kubrik aspired -- as she extolled in the opening sequence. Kubrik's last work was A. I., which raised but did not answer similar questions. Clearly, the world has spoken with its pocketbook, and is now ready to hear about applied psychology and ""emotional intelligence"" -- simply because that is the only way forward with 8 Billion Earthlings, in balance rather than perpetual conflict.<br><br>Many reviews find the points made in the movie to be repetitive. However, most people do not ""get it"" the first time, and need to perceive it from differing perspectives.",10
" Big mix of testosterone and oestrogen
","Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot. Cuz damn that word is being said sooo many times!",7
" No Way This Is A Good Movie

Ken represents manhood without capitalism or without a genital... blah blah blah...<br><br>This movie should not have been a political satire. It should have been a fantasy romance comedy musical such as Entangled or Disney movies. I left the movie theater after its first 30 minutes so if this one didn't turn out to be a masterpiece in the remaining 1:30 hour of its runtime I had much more funtime wandering under hot sun than watching Barbie...<br><br>Robbie and Gosling are as good as they could get with this absurd writing and directing.<br><br>My rating is 3/10 only for the sake of its starting level production staff, PA, Gathering servants who worked for minumum union wage.",3

The movies is truly a heartwarming and uplifting cinematic experience, I've entertained by watching it and it was truly an unforgettable experience. The storytelling was captivating, the performances were outstanding, and the cinematography was breathtaking. It's a must-see for anyone who appreciates great cinema. I can recommend it as an enough art and hope to see movies like this style next years.",10

","On the nose with so much - wasn't too heavy handed in its representation of fenmisim, the patriarchy or anything along those lines.<br><br>However the final third, starting with the war of Ken sent this film into a bit of an anti-climatic ending. Enjoyed it massively up to that point and found it educational without being condisending. As a male especially, to understand the points this film makes it absolutely makes a difference and is eye opening.<br><br>The cop out and 'realisation' Barbie makes at the very end is frankly a cop out, going against the trend of the entire film. Was frankly disappointed and felt it just ran out of ideas.<br><br>Still Gerwig should be commended for her attempt to turn a Mattel product into a film filled with humour, social conscience, style and at the very least humour.<br><br>Just a shame it was so badly let down towards the end.",7

We never goin to forget what it is see Margot and Ryan such an incredible performance the way them put so many emotions and still keep that doll mindset is brilliant and for Greta all my reverence it's breathtaking think that she decided to go up front with such strong movie and we didn't expect anything different from her.

I thought it might be the usual run of the mill silly kids movie, with a completely unserious/unrealistic storyline.<br><br>However, the Barbie storyline touched on a lot of serious real world issues and situations that many people can relate to. With that said, it did feel like a senseless musical at times, with unesscessary sing/dance scenes.<br><br>The essence of the film touches on the juxtaposition of what life would be like if women ruled the world (Barbie Land). And the real world we live in, which is male dominated. This was portrayed well, but did get abit too silly sometimes.<br><br>The level of acting from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, were both bang on. Considering they were playing dolls, they kept a great balance between having to act silly, whilst still keeping a level of seriousness, so the sillyness doesn't go overboard.<br><br>Overall, ""Barbie"" was actually a decent watch with a good level of comedy and realism, whilst keeping the essence of what Barbie represents.<br><br>Isit worth a watch?... Whether you are a woman or man, young or old. Barbie has a little bit for everyone to relate to. So for that reason it is worth a watch, but don't go in with high hopes unless you are a die hard Barbie fan!",6
" Could have been feministic in a good way
","With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot.",5
" This is an mportant movie, hilarious, joyful and profound
","It is a philosophical masterpiece. Clever and thought provoking, hilarious and modern. I didn't expect that at all. The constructed reality is as complex as if Morpheus from ""the Matrix"" offered you the third pill which conjoins two worlds. Deserves the hype<br><br>I hope I don't dive super deep here, if I say that the beginning reminds me of Wlater Benjamin's ""Berlin Childhood"". Playing with toys knows to be joyful and lucid, but really reats some new and confusing ""realty"". To add up, this movie seems to be much more philosophical than ""The Matrix"", I would say. That dimension opens up right afterer ""blue pill vs red pill"" reference was made, because here we hd those two realities colide, ""imagenary"" and ""real*, creating the conjoined ""third realm"" where we see how both realites influence and shape each other. As Slavoj Zizek once pointed out: ""we need a third pill"", so here it is.<br><br>At that point in the movie, story takes a new turn bringing into the focus some familiar social &amp; existential struggles of modern times, providing us with its own critique of it. And it llooks like they had great success doing it. Seemingly effortlessly, they manged to bring out some greater point, keeping the great dynamics, adding the great amount of comedy to it. That was actually so impressive.<br><br>Here ill pull the breaks, I would rather not to try to explain the movie or interprete it, .. Just wanna to say in the end that I strongly rrecommend it for watching. It's fun, profound, its reveling and bringing out so many different layers talking about the social/existential dilemas and actually you can learn much from watching it. And In the end, it gives the right amount of optimism.",10
" You'll love it, hate it, or say ""What?""
","Honestly this is the weirdest movie I have ever seen. It is definitely a good movie but I'm not sure what to make of it. The message was so convoluted that you didn't know what it was trying to say.<br><br>WARNING: The movie is not like ""Enchanted"" where it's a fun romantic comedy. The movie is funny, but it is convoluted with allegory.<br><br>Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie both are fantastic. American Ferrera also shines. Will Ferrell was meh.<br><br>My biggest thing was wondering why they chose to make Mattel cartoon feeling while at the same time trying to portray the real world. You're going to come out of this movie either hating it, loving it, or like me wondering what the hell you just watched.",7
" Barbie
","The 2023 movie ""Barbie"" is a surprisingly subversive and thought-provoking film that takes a sharp look at gender roles and expectations. Directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the film has good visual with a sharp script and great performances.<br><br>The film follows Barbie (Robbie) as she is exiled from Barbieland for not being perfect enough. She ends up in the real world, where she meets Ken (Gosling) and learns about the challenges of being a woman in a patriarchal society.<br><br>The film is full of humor and heart, but it also tackles some serious issues, such as sexism, body image, and the pressure to conform. Gerwig does a good job of balancing these elements, creating a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.<br><br>The performances in the film are all excellent. Robbie is particularly good as Barbie, bringing both humor and vulnerability to the role. Gosling is also great as Ken, and the two have great chemistry together.<br><br>The film's visuals are also stunning. The sets are nicely designed, and the costumes are good. It's clear that a lot of care went into its production.<br><br>Kids seem to love it and it's really a film for them even if I wouldn't watch it a second time personally.",5
" Wrapped in Plastic, It's Fantastic
","After years and years of development and casting changes, the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see. Co-written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Gerwig and co-produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2023 and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros' 100th year since their inception. Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy, the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy.<br><br>The film follows Stereotypical Barbie and Ken going on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis, all the while encountering people who either want to make or break the doll's spirits. Before going into the story itself, the ensemble cast must be addressed, especially Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the primary Barbie and Ken respectively. In addition to sharing witty chemistry with each other, the multiple Barbies and Kens around Barbieland showcase the blessings of multiple roles for women to take on and a curse in how that can influence the men around them to call the shots. Alongside them is America Ferrera as Mattel employee Gloria who has as much to do with Barbie's existential crisis as she does in trying to repair her distant daughter Sasha stuck in her grumpy teen phase, showcasing how different generations operate around the famous Barbie line of toy making. Alongside many other well known names like Will Ferrell and Rhea Perlman as two differentiating role models for women around the world, the ensemble cast is exactly what will draw butts into seats.<br><br>Now as far as the film itself is concerned, the biggest contributing factor to how outlandish it is is that its worldbuilding makes no sense at all. Barbieland is supposed to be the place where all the Barbies and Kens live their lives to the fullest, yet the real world is interlinked based on how people have played with them. That being said, since the film is meant to highlight the conflicting views of feminism in a still patriarchal society, the imaginative execution of how the dolls and people interact makes for a lot of eye opening politics centered around how complicated the world truly is. While it's difficult to say if the film hit all of its targets, especially when the politics it tackles are still relevant today, its humor and commentary lies in the blending of childhood nostalgia and adult intellectualism. This is what partially leads to Barbie's wanting to leave her ""perfect"" paradise and Ken's attempts to see Barbie for who he pretends to be. Who could have thought a Barbie movie would have reminded us how difficult it is to face having to hide who we truly are out of pressure?<br><br>Of course, the production and costume design are what truly stand out around this ambitious feature. In contrast to the mundane real world, Barbieland is composed of bright colors and make-believe dream houses, complete with a wide variety of diverse costumes and elaborate sets making up the surreal fantasy landscape. As the Barbies function through pretend toy logic, there are some amusing visual gags based on their imaginary lifestyles and how they appear based on what their owners and Mattel did to them in the long run. The addition of much cartoony stunt work makes the film even more hilarious when you realize how little logic is actually in the film depending on the universe. Next to Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt lending their talents to an accompanying score and amusing musical numbers, one can sense a true glance of nostalgia with many well known hit songs that contribute to the film's tone and commercial exploitation. It's hard to say if the film is a jukebox musical or not, but it certainly is a riot with how much the audience will jive to the beat of the tunes.<br><br>In a day and age where we seem to be forgetting how much fun movies can truly be, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a wonderful reminder as to why it's ok to embrace your inner child in a world overrun with societal beatdowns and forced maturity. Whether or not you've ever been into the Barbie toy line, this film is an absolute must watch for both the casual filmgoer and fans of hysterical fantasy comedies. It is self aware enough to make us laugh at even the smallest of jokes, it is mature enough to embrace its own immaturity, and it is a reason to still support the hard working crew with how the film industry is going nowadays.",9
" Something was missing
","I enjoyed the creation of the Barbie world, the costumes, set design, and I think the angle they took in terms of themes was interesting and relevant. The script, however, was not that solid.<br><br>They were going for a direct, transparent, explain the deep themes of the story type of dialogue, but it often had a hard time landing. Particularly at the beginning. Some things felt spoon-fed to the audience, as if they weren't going to understand the givens of Ken realizing he loved the patriarchy because he felt he had never had any voice in Barbie Land. We visually understand it, but then it is explained a fee times through on the nose dialogue which felt unnecessary.<br><br>The pacing of the film feels a bit awkward at times. You also never fuuully connect with the characters and their struggles, even though Margot Roby and Ryan Gosling are amazing actors and enjoyable to watch. You're following a line of events and laid out comments about the patriarchy and the place of women in todays world. But it was exactly the most profound (which is fiiiine, it's a movie about a doll after-all, but if they were going for this pov they should've dug deeper, in my opinion).<br><br>I love all the actors involved, and the work of Greta Gerwig and the work of Noah Baumbach. But this wasn't their best work.<br><br>I would still recommend seeing it to form your own opinion. You can still enjoy the world, the acting, and have a laugh here and there. Also, for people who have never taken a look at our binary, sexist, and patriarchal society, it could be eye opening. For my part, I often think about how exhausting it is to live in a world where men are in most positions of power and impose their ways on others, particularly women, so I wanted more out of the argument of the movie.

" Movie of the summer!
","Barbie<br><br>Dazzling, heartfelt and brilliantly funny. Comedy of the year, movie of the summer!<br><br>Barbie is a beautiful blend of comedy and heart. Aided deftly by colourful visuals, Greta Gerwig tells the story of a doll coming to life, with as much intellect and emotion that's needed.<br><br>Barbie is unabashedly feminist, will ruffle some feathers (as it should), and will delight even more people. Themes of existentialism, individualism and masculinity are also dealt with.<br><br>Despite being a product of Mattel, Greta found a way to critique the parent company (although it's funny that the product that mocks the maker ends up raking in more money for the maker).<br><br>Margot Robbie is Barbie! She was an agreeable canvas, and she allowed Greta Gerwig to paint a very nuanced portrayal of Barbie. Ryan Gosling turns out a career-best performance in Barbie, stealing and shining in all of his scenes. The supporting cast also gives great performances.<br><br>The soundtrack was fitting, guiding the movie down to the finish line with Billie Eilish's 'What was I made for' delivering a wonderful culmination. The set design and costumes were brilliant too.<br><br>The lore of Barbie spans over six decades, so compressing it all into one movie was a definite challenge, but Greta was able to bring the most important things (including Easter eggs and fan service) to the movie.<br><br>Barbie does have its failings, and the most noticeable is the plot. The first half is very intriguing, quirky and pays homage to other movies, but the second half isn't as tight.<br><br>Barbie isn't perfect but it's a beautiful dose of everything good.<br><br>8/10.",8
" Barbie Movie does give an Identity to Barbie of GenZ
","""I want to do the imagining. I don't want to be the idea."".<br><br>When my kid informed me he and his friends were going to see a Barbie movie, I couldn't believe it. The stereotypical mother in me instantly responded. Seeing as how MI and IJ were running in parallel in theatres, I was taken aback and asked him why a group of boys would be interested in seeing Barbie. Will there be any girls there? I'm guessing I probably sounded kind of dorky in his ears. His response, though, was typical of his generation:This is a spoof and not a movie aimed at just girls, Mom. But, like any mother, I made arrangements to watch the movie myself before he did. Also, the other reason was that as a kid, I had eight dolls, and the majority of my time went into playing with them and building stories. And only Barbie was one of those dolls whose identity was recognised consistently over the globe. Barbie therefore represents the shared imagination of all kids who play with it across the world.<br><br>It was the right decision to see this film because otherwise I would not have realised what a brilliant move it was for the brand to reach out to younger consumers. Barbie is a great gimmick for a rebranding campaign to appeal to Generation Z, which places an emphasis on pragmatics.<br><br>We all know that Barbie has a checkered history. Barbie's version as a math-averse doll was not received well. Barbie, packaged with a ""don't eat"" diet handbook, protested. Someone who seems black on the exterior but is really white on the inside was being mocked by Oreao's crazy cookie Barbie. The creepiest thing was pregnant Barbie with babies in her belly, and the oddest thing was when Barbie went through puberty. Hijab Barbie and Virus Barbie both sparked new debates. Parents were largely concerned about the FBI tip of a security threat regarding the Video Girl Barbie.<br><br>Most criticised among Gen Z was Barbie's excessively slender body, which has been an undesirable role model for women. It precisely articulates the enormous problem of existential crises that the outside world has manufactured and which individuals have mindlessly embraced.<br><br>To begin with, the film explored the same themes, including the existential difficulties brought on by the persistence of patriarchy and Barbie stereotypes. The story starts with Barbie living a happy life in Barbieland, but she notices that she is developing human consciousness. To find answers, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality. As she and Ken enter the real world, Barbie is overwhelmed to see the many ways in which women are treated as objects and devalued. Multiple sets of eyes scrutinise all of their actions. Both Barbie and Ken's masculine awakenings also go through existential crises. Later in the movie, with Ken's changed behaviour after going to the real world, Barbie's attempt to appease Ken's manly ego by playing a weakling is satire. However, the much-touted ""gender war"" is seen humorously despite the fact that it still exists, whether people accept it or not.<br><br>Now, coming to the technical part of the film, the Barbie-land segment was overdone. The transition from Barbie Land to the actual world was also too long; a crisp cut here, as in Jumanji, would have made more sense. So the movie has a sluggish start, but it picks up speed and becomes engaging as time goes on. The humour was really cliched and cheap, so that wasn't great.<br><br>Both Margot's and Ryan's performances were excellent. While the actors were all spot-on, the film's direction let it down by not keeping the action moving at a good clip and by delivering a confusing muddle of a plot and a message that left viewers with no clear conclusions. A more succinct conclusion would have been fantastic. Though I did like the part at the end where, at the workplace, Barbie prefers Flat Sandals over heels, I was relating all this to my pageant life, where wearing a minimum of 3.5 inches of heels was mandatory before stepping out of your room in public. In the movie, Barbie leaves the fake world behind.<br><br>To end with my favourite line by Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, played by Rhea Perlman: ""Humans have only one ending. Ideas live for ever.""
The movie is a good introduction to the world of dolls for those who haven't seen anything like it before. It is a case study in itself, showing how the power of sentiment is a driving force in the doll industry. After a year of record sales during the epidemic, last year saw a dip, so it's easy to see why Mattel is counting on the new Barbie film to reverse the trend by syncing up with generation Z's pragmatic thinking.",7
" Exceeded all expectations!
","Barbie was hilarious, emotional and exciting. I LOVED the wardrobe and props - very colorful and exact replicas of what I played with in the 90s. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie - casting was perfect. I especially loved the humor and emotional grasp this movie had on the audience in the movie theatre. This is definitely a feel good movie and I hope they continue the franchise. I have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner, in good way! There is a lot of action, dancing and surprise ha ha moments. This is perfect for families and adults really; go see it!",9
" I get the message but I feel it was rushed
","The movie is colourful, fun and had a message about the, State of the world as it is today. I get the feminist message but it feels like a little exposion on how the events of the plot panned out would have helped complete it.<br><br>The first half went along pretty well in tems of the Stirling but in the second half of felt something was missing in the conflict and eventual resolution.<br><br>Thst said Margot Robbie was born to play this role and did it marvelously and the supporting cast was great too. America Ferrera did well as dis Ryan Gosling in a convincing Ken character.<br><br>However I saw kids in the theatre and probably over 10s would get it more than younger children.",7
" This started off great and then went horribly awry
","I went to see this knowing nothing and exspecting nothing. I was confused with the reference to 1001 Space Odyssey at the beginning but was thrilled with our introduction to the Barbie World. It was a feast for the eyes and a blast from the past. It brought back my childhood make believe adventures with the dolls. Margot Robbie was perfect casting for Barbie. She believably naive without being stupid. I was laughing out loud. I was thrilled with the music and dance numbers. Ryan Gosling's Ken was also adorable. It's when they enter ""the real world"" that things go terribly wrong. Every character outside Barbieland is portrayed in a juvenile manner that made it hard to watch. Then the story just fell apart. It reminded me of a bad SNL sketch where the writers had a great idea but didn't know how to land the punch line or end the skit. I really felt that having the Barbies manipulate the men into going to war to regain control of Barbieland reeked of misogyny. If this had been a play I would have walked out at intermission. I'm really shocked that Mattel let their named be used. If this movie had just stayed in Barbieland and explored more of how the dolls ""live"" I would have given this a 10.",4
" Amazing
","You don't know what to expect before watching Barbie, and I can assure you it met my expectations and exceeded them!<br><br>I really recommend you watching it! Such a great work behind and such a great movie. It touches topics among feminism, the patriarchy and how hard and difficult it's to be a woman.<br><br>The actors did amazing and Greta did such a great job with this movie, it's what we all need and wanted.<br><br>Also shoutout to the music from the movie and the amazing songs that the artists have created for it. I totally recommended it! I watched it some days ago and can't wait to go watch it again!!!!!",10
" It was fun... For a while longer than i though
","I loved how they translated the Barbieland from our imaginations tp screen. The clothes, colours and stages are beautifully done.<br><br>The way they show stiff unbendable limbs are just such a simple detail, comical in a way but also sad and stiff. How can girls compare themselves to a unbendy, out of proportion, busty blonde. And in this case a Barbie without a true purpose. No one wants to be known as stereotypical... Thats just average...<br><br>The story is fun. Barbie is having an existential crisis while Ken just needs a bit of love.<br><br>I kept wondering what the *deep dive story* is all about. Is this a person playing with Barbies and Kens and just thinking ""what if""?<br><br>The story may be about nothing important. Or it might showcase the strugles of the real world.<br><br>Do girls still play with Barbie and does Ken even feature??<br><br>The soundtrack is good.<br><br>And i LOVE Weird Barbie but i dont think my Barbie would have made it in the movie, she was attacked by hooligans with toothpick spikes and she lost her head when the tried fitting her into King Solomons Mines (do you remember the) stewpot.<br><br>.... And John Cena - damn he is looking good here...",6
" Not for me
","If you are a girl and under 12 definitely go watch this movie. If you are anything else read my review: Not sure what i was expecting before, but I was clearly disappointed in the plot. A boring start with some interesting moments during the middle, and a super boring ending. Maybe the visuals were indeed nice, but thats not enough or at least should not be. Margot is indeed worthy of the role, great acting, for that reason the 5 stars are more than enough. Glad that I did not pay for the advertisements and the propaganda ;)
So in order to summarise, its not something i would recommend , the rating is over buffed, and the 2 hours of the movie is way too much.",5
" Much more than I expected
","I expected a funny, easy-going movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone. I was amazed by the depth of the story. Feminism done right, without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases. A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing. Beautiful story abour equality, feminism, finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world.",10
" Barbie
","I wasn't expecting much, after all, it is a movie about a doll - however, I was pleasantly surprised that it managed to develop a story that it was relevant and had a strong emotional core.<br><br>Obviously, it isn't without flaws: it got too campy for my tastes (but not fully over-the-top) and it got a little too lost in its own message towards the end. Regardless, it never lost the entertainment factor that a movie about Barbie should have - so I can only give props to the director and the actors.<br><br>For the first few minutes, I was worried that the movie was going to be just ""stupid fun"" but as they progressed the plot, it got better and better - I think the resolution of both plotlines of Barbie and Ken were brilliant and quite satisfying.<br><br>The highlight was the comedy, the relationship between the characters and their commentary about feminism, consumerism and patriarchy.",7
" a witty, modern day satire with a well presented ending
","Greta gerwig does better to feminism than judith butler with this brilliant piece.<br><br>Margot robbie, ryan gosling, america ferrera they all marvelous in the movie. I believe cillian murphy will get the oscar but gosling is such a good challenge with his portrayal. Also, america ferrera is a good actress but somehow she always plays similar woman portrayals, i wish she would try thriller genre, she has that aura in her. Will ferrell was too much for me, he also plays same characters for such long time.<br><br>The main message in the movie which "" a woman can do/be whatever/whoever she wants"" is crystal clear. In a much better way than twisting old fairtales to ""girlboss"" movies which does no good to strong womanhood, au contraire, being confusing for girls to be strong/leader in anytime in any circumstances. Feminism is about having uninterrupted free will whether to be a mum or a boss or both and knowing those are all equally valid like when men does exactly the same and stay men enough.",9
" Spoiler-Free Unbiased Review
","Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature.<br><br>Barbie pushes the boundaries of what a people blindly may assume a Barbie movie should or would be able to- in both good ways, and bad ways.<br><br>The good- Barbie is at many moments, fun, adaptive, emotional, even philosophically provoking. The story is enjoyable and attention-grabbing while both Gosling and Robbie have played their roles to a T. Margot Robbie played the ""stereotypical Barbie"" so well, almost too well at times. Ryan Gosling played Ken so well and the contrast between him in two different arcs of the film were not only distinct but all-believable. The costume design was superb and I was thoroughly impressed with some of the visuals and set design throughout. The CGI is very poor at a few scenes (which normally I would put under cons) BUT the film doesn't take its self too seriously during those scenes, so it's rather comical than anything.<br><br>The bad- The writing of this film contains certain elements of contradiction; It essentially claims that women can (mostly) only be powerful by holding ""high societal job responsibilities,"" such as being a lawyer, doctor, president, etc; when this just simply isn't true, MOTHERS FOR EXAMPLE! Being a mother is one of (if not the biggest) responsibility a human can have- the idea of a collective job that can single handedly shift an entire generations thinking? Yeah, sorry but mother's are the most powerful. The film at several moments gets very political but subliminally and not-subliminally, which is always annoying no matter what political beliefs you carry, it's just almost always cringe I guess?<br><br>TLDR;
""Barbie"" triumphs in being fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. The film, like many others, sells itself short by its political agenda and removes depth by doing so. Overall a mostly enjoyable experience meant for an adult audience.<br><br>7.3/10.",7
" Enchantment w/ genuine emotion
","I absolutely loved it. Margot Robbie is the perfect stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives an Oscar-worthy performance and has a true rock 'n' roll voice. The soundtrack is also very, very good. Subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references. Michael Cera is funnily adorable. Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion. Barbie was brilliantly cast. I loved Ryan Gosling. He's terrific as Ken and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. The ending is good and it's worth sticking around to watch the credits.",10
" Better Than Expected . . . Still Not Great
","Barbie provided the ying to Oppenheimer's yang. It was significantly better than I anticipated due to it's artistic filming, fun casting, and plot. I expected a 3/10 and it was twice as nice, coming in at a solid 6/10.<br><br>What to like: The sets were a fun mix of real word items and ""Barbified"" backdrops/objects. This quickly normalized the weird blend of a live-action movie based on a toy. The star-studded cast was fantastic! It was fun to watch so many familiar faces in such silly roles.<br><br>What not to like: The part where Barbie failed was in it's preachiness. I'm fine with films having an underlying message- and I even agree with the overall message it seems Barbie was trying to make. America Ferrera's rant towards the end was a bit too heavy/angry for me and made it seem that women had cornered the market on every hardship imaginable. This angry turn made the movie far less fun.",6

In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in.

" Barbie is a pretty fun movie to watch and worth the hype.
","As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the ""Dawn of Men"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.<br><br>Honestly, I didn't get everything I expected and I cannot say what I got is better than what I had expected. However, 2 hours of my time in front of that huge screen was pretty fun because Barbie is simply a very fun movie to watch and I absolutely loved it. I believe this is thanks to the feeling of watching it on the big screen with a bunch of strangers around to laugh with. I will definitely watch the movie again upon the digital release to try to prove myself wrong.<br><br>Margot Robbie is, as always, phenomenal in the movie. Her incredible talent and charm carries almost the entire film, not to mention that she is a co-producer. She is not the best casting choice to play a Barbie doll but in this particular Barbie movie, she was born for the role. Her co-star Ryan Gosling is the comedic heart of the movie. Without him, the movie would certainly not be as fun as it is. The rest of the cast also compliment their roles fairly well, playing iconic characters and dolls of different races and sizes.<br><br>I was expecting a longer, a more serious and elaborate plot for Barbie but what I got instead is not too bad. The movie clearly carries a message and that message is clearly conveyed through a plot that is brief and basically easy to understand which is built up in a favorable way.<br><br>The production design and the costume design is certainly a huge part of the film. All the costumes, sets, props and everything look and feel so compelling and, most important of all, accurate to the overall history and legacy of Barbie and Mattel. I hugely respect that attention to detail.<br><br>At the end of the day, Barbie is a movie I have been impatiently waiting for a long time and that I feel honored to have seen today on the opening day. It is a beautiful work of art paying beautiful homage to the legacy of it's origins and I am happy that I started loving this movie way before its release . . .",7
" A Barbie Disaster - 2023's Biggest Letdown
","I had high hopes for the 2023 Barbie movie, but sadly, it turned out to be an absolute disaster. It's hard to believe that a franchise as iconic as Barbie could produce something so disappointing.<br><br>First and foremost, the plot was painfully predictable and uninspired. It felt like a recycled storyline from previous Barbie movies, with Barbie once again finding herself in a magical world and having to save the day. There was no originality or creativity to be found here, and it left me longing for a more engaging and thought-provoking narrative.<br><br>The characters were equally lackluster. Barbie, who is supposed to be a role model for young girls, came across as shallow and one-dimensional. She seemed more interested in her appearance and wardrobe than in any meaningful character development. The supporting characters were forgettable at best, with their actions and motivations feeling forced and contrived.<br><br>The animation was another major letdown. In an era where animation has reached incredible heights of realism and creativity, Barbie 2023 looked like it belonged in the early 2000s. The visuals were bland, and the character animations lacked the fluidity and expressiveness we've come to expect from modern animated films.<br><br>Even the music, which has been a highlight of previous Barbie movies, fell flat. The songs were forgettable and lacked the catchy melodies that make Barbie movies so enjoyable for young audiences.<br><br>But perhaps the most disappointing aspect of Barbie 2023 was its missed opportunity to convey meaningful messages to its target audience. Previous Barbie movies have tackled important themes like friendship, perseverance, and self-acceptance. In contrast, this movie seemed more interested in promoting consumerism and materialism, sending the wrong message to impressionable young viewers.<br><br>In conclusion, Barbie 2023 was a major letdown in every sense of the word. It lacked an engaging plot, well-developed characters, stunning animation, and meaningful messages. It's a shame that a beloved franchise like Barbie could produce such a lackluster film. Save your time and money and skip this one - you won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.",2
" Best Communal Cinema Experience Since Endgame
",I was all in for this movie before I saw it. As time went by I got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and I'd inevitably be disappointed. Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.<br><br>Barbie is funnier and more touching than I was expecting. It's just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about Barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way. I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can. Going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful. Fill two hours of your time with joy and Kenergy! We are all Kenough.,10
" It's good, but overrated
","It's a good movie, worth the watch but nothing special. It was really overhyped worldwide and although it's a good movie, it's nothing special. I believe standards have gone up in recent times and movies are getting better, and this is below that. However it tells an important story, and is a somewhat fun and education movie. I would rate it 6.5-7/10. Even though it's a ""Barbie"" movie, kids under probably 13 wouldn't understand the movie well. The moral of the story isn't just Barbie's and their fun little world. It's somewhat serious, and kids would only see the Barbie part, and not understand the point of the movie.",7
" Barbie
","Very good movie Ryan acting is very nice also Margarot . I haven't totally watched this movie but anyway it's good upto I saw this.greta gerwig movies always good movies this film is also not exceptional from that she maintained her touch.coming to talk about screenplay gerwig and her husband Noah their combo both are legendary directors their combo is good not only his personal life but also in silver screen.ryan gosling is rarely do these type characters most of his movies he delivers same expression, thinking about his acting I am not fan for him but I like Margarot I am a big fan for her role Harley Quinn.",10
" So many messages. Congrats
","It's impressive how so many messages were cleverly conveyed through a well-known brand.<br><br>The movie addressed a range of great themes, skillfully communicated through colors and a cute fairytale-like presentation.<br><br>-One of the key messages is when Barbie talks to Ken in the end and her words focus mostly on the fact that individuals should find their completeness within themselves before entering a relationship. Exploring personal preferences and self-awareness is vital before projecting unresolved issues onto a partnership. Developing a strong self-relationship is a foundational step before building connections with others.<br><br>-The movie also transforms the traditional Barbie world to a world where men pursue their interests while Barbies serve them. This shift seems to show the challenge of achieving equality in relationships, highlighting the struggle to establish and maintain balance between feminism and patriarchy.<br><br>-A particularly touching moment is Barbie creator's monologue. It resonates as an empowerment boost for women who stay in abusive situations due to their lack of self-confidence and fear of taking control of their lives.<br><br>-The film addresses also how society imposes unrealistic role models, leading to personal dissatisfaction. Barbie has been/still is an example of those models. However, if our real lives start being reflected into the doll, we will notice how miserable and depressing we all are.<br><br>It's sad to see negative reviews for this impactful attempt that managed to encapsulate these messages.",7
" Whit, charm, and lots to say
","This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding. It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.<br><br>I will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater, know your director. This was not a film created to advertise for Barbie, this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for Oscar's. They know what they want to say and why. The target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like Patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie. But don't let this deter you. There's enough music, humor, and and character development for Barbie and Ken to keep the audience entertained even if it's over their head.",10
" I little better than just ok
","I'm not a fan of modern day musicals. I strongly disliked LaLaLand, could never get through it. Barbie on the other hand I watched all the way through even though I thought it was sugary sweet. Ick. Peer pressure, ""ya gotta see it!"" The last 15 minutes of dialogue in the movie was very good. Actually wish I would have just watched that last 15 minutes rather than the entire movie. The actors/actresses I felt did a good job on their characters. It would have been better, in my opinion, if Barbie was an actual movie without all the plastic sets, the portal from land to sea etc. With all the technology out there surely the sets could have been realistic.",7
" First half excellent, second half clunkily on-the-nose
","The first half is excellent, it starts with a 2001 Dawn of Man parody with Robbie as the original striped Barbie in place of the monolith, then shows us Barbieland. Barbie is overrun with morbid thoughts, so travels to the Real World with a stowaway Ken.<br><br>At this point, it starts to lose its way - it gets bogged down in preaching against patriarchy - a word used so many times you could sip low-alcohol beer every time they say the word and be unconscious by the end.<br><br>Characters give long monologues on how it's ""literally impossible to be a woman"", and the Barbies turn the Kens against each other bizarrely by using their sex appeal to evoke jealousy (is that really a feminist message?!).<br><br>Whatever they were trying to say here, it doesn't come across well. It's preachy, on-the-nose, and too unbelievable to communicate a real message. Other films like Gone Girl with its Cool Girl monologue, or comedies like Bad Moms, make the point this movie seems to be trying to make much more effectively.<br><br>Barbieland looks amazing, and the first sections there are fun (the whole patriarchy messaging was wisely cut out of the trailers). It would have been better to make this a Fool Triumphant story like Legally Blonde, where Stereotypical Barbie (as Robbie's Barbie is known) is seen as an airheaded bimbo in the real world yet proves herself.",5
" A fantastic satirical drama of patriarchy
","A fantastic satirical drama on patriarchy blended with witty humor, fabulous direction, and fabulous acting.<br><br>It can be many things, but not a kids' film or gender-specific film.<br><br>Greta takes us into fantasy barbieland with the deep concepts of consumerism, patriarcy, physical insecurity, and self-discovery cleverly layered under it.<br><br>Conveys all these in a satirical and humorous way subtly and beautifully.<br><br>I loved how it shows both extremes of patriarchy of men and also women.<br><br>The sets, visuals, music, and costumes were just so amazing sets the whole vibe.<br><br>Ken and Barbie had such awesome chemistry and genreated great humor on the screen.<br><br>I was so excited to see margot robbie &amp; emma mackey together in the film. And they were fantastic. All the others were beautiful, both in looks and acting.<br><br>There are some really good one-liner and monologues which are funny &amp; make you think at the same time.<br><br>I felt good hearing about the response for Barbie, considering the talk around baribie being a silly film for only kids or gender s0ecific. But it's much more than that.<br><br>So, indians, after watching the hyped up oppenheimer, watch Barbie too, and you won't be disappointed.",9
" I Feel Pretty...again
","Barbie is full of pros and cons<br><br>The movie was fun and had wild adventures. I loved the fun characters and the dancing was INCREDIBLE! It was colorful and bright. Characters popping up from left and right exuding glitter and delight! The movie was all-around Barbie to the maximum even through the outfits!<br><br>(Women are powerful and can make a change) The message was...stated...kind of...I think so...? The movie did not put it really out there. There were many moments that made you stop and say ""huh?"" as well as insert that awkward laugh you give when your nan/gramps/great aunt/kid says something they really shouldn't have said, or known, outloud. It gave me the feel of ""I Feel Pretty""; movie with the intention of getting a message across, but never really gets it there. Even the ending made me say ""Are you serious?""<br><br>Overall, if you are looking for a movie with a good time, this one can be it. I did laugh a lot though, so there is that to look forward to.",6
" what is happening to this world?!
","Let me get it straight! People had the choice of watching this film and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, and they chose this?! WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS WORLD?!<br><br>I dare say that it was one of the worst movies I've watched recently. Chaotic plot with lots of holes in it and no time to show all the points the director meant to show. I mean, the director was trying to change the whole universe's patriarchy with this little pink movie! Which ended up being a disaster! This film was an insult to both feminists and anti-feminists.<br><br>The performances were even worse. This was Margo Ruby and Ryan Gosling's worst performance so far.<br><br>A total waste of time.<br><br>I am positive that If it weren't for the trillion dollars of advertisement, this movie would have crashed at the box office.",3
" I know... A 10 rating is ridiculous.. but hear me out...
","If you are expecting it to be so stupid ur gonna love it... Ur in the right place. I refused to watch extras and trailers, I wanted to be surprised. And I was! It's cheesey AF at first.. if u can get past 15 mins of everyone saying the name Barbie, you will survive this movie. In the beginning they ""flip"" through past Barbies and I seen quite a few that used to own.. they also ""flash"" through some barbie clothes that will bring u right back to childhood. For nastalgia sake this movie will not disappoint... For new comer's sake, this movie will not disappoint! We counted the reasons why it's rated PG-13 and it's kinda hilarious.<br><br>I hope there's a second movie... Barbie and The Rockers!!!!",10
" It is good but I would not say great
",The film was good and there were scenes that were fun to watch. One thing it failed was being funny and there were a couple of overrated scenes. It was entertaining and many people who have seen it or are about see it would agree with me. I would not see it again anytime more this year but maybe in two years I would watch it again. There is definitely way too much hype and at least in my opinion it is not as good as everyone is saying it is. This is most money and the most successful movie a Warner bros movie has been. The certain people that would love this movie is girls. Also women and men age 30 - 50. If you a women or girl or a men I would definitely recommend this film.,7
" one of the best films of the year
","I am going to be so shocked if this isn't the biggest movie of the year. Barbie was fun, hilarious, while also being real, and heart wrenching. I found myself laughing and crying throughout the film. The movie is incredibly well done, and the entire cast was phenomenal. I highly encourage everyone to watch the film, it perfectly balanced real, current issues while remaining a really fun film.<br><br>Margot Robbie blew the role of Barbie out of the water, and Ryan Gosling as Ken was absolute perfection. Their interactions had me (and the theatre) absolutely dying. I can't wait to watch this movie over and over again!",10
" Toy-story with political sarcasm!
","I enjoyed the movie a lot with many jokes and sarcasm the characters keep throwing.<br><br>It was interesting and unexpected view to face that barbie is a matriarchal concept. On the other hand, miserable but thriving Kens' lives with various music was very comical and fun. Such a landscape and world-setting is something only few of us have seen in real world where women have increasingly thrived for social power.<br><br>Meanwhile, the storyline is pretty straightforward. It is a typical fantasy movie that a character goes to real world, cause a problem intertwined with the imaginary and real world and solve them together with real humans. So in that sense, there was no sequence of surprise as such. However, it was a movie with a good length of about 90 minutes, to casually enjoy watching with your family and friends!",7
" Barbie
",So good but the only part I don't like is the scene when the boys take over the town apart from that it's perfect. Barbie is a heartwarming family movie with great actors and a great freaking plot. Its my favorite movie and its highly recommended for a family but there some bad words like vagina and penis. I think it should be recommended for 12 and over. The rating 12A (12 adult ) and it is 1h and 54m. If u don't like comedy movies ( I'm sure u like comedy's) than this movie is not for u. Thank u all for reading this review and I hope u read my other reviews. (By the way my reviews have spoilers),10
" Gosling Steals the Show.
","Walk into this film, not completely knowing what to expect but came out pleasantly surprised. Good set designs a lot of good shots throughout the film. Pretty solid humor throughout the film. So overall good experience. But now, in terms of casting Margot Robbie was a great choice for Barbie, but man does Ryan gosling really steal the show almost makes me wish he was in more comedies. Will Ferrell also makes an appearance and there's a pretty good job. And in terms of the overall message definitely wasn't as preachy as most people put it out to be. So I don't think the overall message was as bad as some people had it out but overall a fan film would recommend.",7
" Just ok - end falls flat
","Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint! This one could have been a lot better.",5
" Worth the wait
","If Barbie could've done anything with this movie, this is the best it could've done. Pulled off with comedy, heart, and emotion, Barbie delivers.<br><br>Cast is great. No questions asked. I loved some of the smaller cameos in this film, definitely made the movie more appealing.<br><br>Humor is back and forth in this movie, and all the jokes will keep you chuckling. I had some people laughing louder than the movie itself to some of these jokes. Props to you, Gerwig.<br><br>Emotion is heavily involved in the third act of the film, and definitely changes tone. The ending takes sort of a twist, but is a good way to end the film.<br><br>Overall, the film is great. Highly recommend seeing. Some of the jokes are more adult, so maybe think twice before taking your kid to see this. If you don't have kids, go see this. It'll be worth your money.",8
" Not riveting, but good
","Honestly I loved it. The colors were brilliant. The usage of popular artists and actors as really well done. All of the characters were brilliantly casted. The it was intriguing, and generally attriactive for both young and mature audiences. I think because of this though, it just didn't hit as hard for me. The messages within the movie were quite profound, and many of my friends ended up emotional due to its relatability and the fact that nothing actually changed at the end. Good overall, stellar for younger audiences, and would 100% recommend to a younger child. Not my color palette, so it was a bit bright. Not riveting. Just good.",7
" Plastic Perils: A Hollow Venture into Doll-Dom
","""Barbie (2023)"" attempted to mold a modern narrative around the iconic doll, but what unraveled was a feature film that was as plastic and hollow as the toy it's inspired by. The film sets forth with a glittery promise of self-discovery and empowerment but stumbles and falls face-first into a puddle of clichés and superficiality.<br><br>The protagonist's journey from a boxed perfection to a self-realized individual is filled with predictable plot twists and eye-roll-inducing dialogues. The script seems to be churned out from a factory of trite, lacking any originality or depth, much like the molded plastic of a Barbie doll.<br><br>The animation, touted as one of the highlights, is nothing more than a barrage of pastel colors and unrealistic body proportions. It fails to breathe life into the characters or the world around them, making it a plastic paradise devoid of any genuine emotion or relatability.<br><br>Supporting characters are as one-dimensional as they come, each embodying a blatant stereotype without any redeeming qualities. They flutter through the scenes, contributing nothing to the narrative other than filling the already cluttered screen.<br><br>The attempt to modernize Barbie and make her relatable to the contemporary audience is a lost cause as the essence of what makes Barbie iconic is buried under a heap of modern-day jargon and misplaced attempts at humor.<br><br>The villain, a caricature of societal expectations, is as menacing as a bubble wrap, failing to evoke any real threat or concern.<br><br>Barbie is a missed opportunity to delve into the evolving identity and societal expectations of women. Instead, it serves a shallow, glitter-coated narrative that's as fleeting and forgettable as a fashion trend. In trying to find Barbie's place in the modern world, the film loses its way and ends up being a lackluster parade of plasticity.",2
" See this in the theater!
","The movie is fun, silly, and entertaining. Saw this in the theater which is the first time I've been in one since 2020 most people including myself for dressed up. Everyone interacted with the movie by cheering and clapping throughout. After the movie was over everyone was so uplifted that chatting in the lobby was actually a thing between strangers. That's a lot to get from a little movie about a small doll. I told my husband on the way home we will have to find a karaoke version of a song that Ken sings but not necessarily the one that Barbie does. Will Ferrell was unexpected and as always completely enjoyable.",9
" I think I'm in the wrong demographic
","I saw this movie in theatres, and I found it kind of underwhelming. Each and every act of the film feels so different and disconnected from the other, and by the end it feels like the plot looses traction. But that doesn't mean I thought the movie was bad, I thought it was funny and charming all throughout, but I guess my issue is that I'm in the wrong demographic. Near the beginning and near the end, there's a strong theme of motherhood and the troubles of being a woman, and as a man, I can't relate. As a result, I had a hard time relating to a lot of this movies big plot points and emotional moments. And on top of that, halfway though it becomes exceedingly boring. But overall, I'd say it's a solid 7/10.",7
" Makes you think
","The movie is great. Everyone says it's very preachy but I actually think the societal expose is done in a very tasteful manner. It makes you think about the world we live in and points out ridiculous things that have always been there but we never paid attention to - for example, why most cash has famous men on them, and not one woman (with some exceptions around the world, of course). It also presents Ken the way women have been portrayed in movies since the beginning of the movie industry - clingy, confused, a bit inadequate, annoying, etc.<br><br>It's smart, it's very funny, it's interesting and it deserves the hype.",8
" Not worth the hype
","The movie as it is is really great and the work on it deserves all the best critics...
But I personally haven't strongly connected to the storyline. They really could have came up with much better strory line which would make this amazingly done movie even better.<br><br>I don't know but watching the trailer for the movie I thought that it would be story about Ken being spy from the outside world, but it turned out not to be true.<br><br>Also I do not find the film funny at all, maybe I did not understand some jokes, maybe I ignored some but I don't think it's funny at all.<br><br>But as I said at the very beginning the movie directing is really great and the whole movie team did the great job as well as actors did. &lt;3.",6
" Greta did it!
","Greta Gerwig did it. Broke the ceiling financially for a movie directed by a woman.<br><br>I like all of her work and the Barbie theme was a daring one to take on. Then again she created a powerful version of Little Women. I also figured if Isa Rae agreed to be in this, there had to be more to it.<br><br>It was so much funnier than expected. They figured out how to not make a parody of Barbie and Ken. That's no small task.<br><br>I don't want to give away anything because everyone is going to see themselves in this in another way. It's clever, thoughtful, and so funny. The actors performed to perfection.<br><br>There's a lot to unpack in this movie. I want to watch it again. It has all the makings of a classic and a cult film.",10
" Someone's a fan of Warren Beatty
","Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.",7
" Cute, but limiting in scope
","Maybe I will be perceived as one of those insecure middle-aged men who is ""terrified"" of women, as labeled by another poster on here, but I assure you, I'm not.<br><br>First of all, I'm gay, so I'm just here to provide a more unbiased and alternative look at the reality of what the world is nowadays when it comes to what I see between men and women. Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I don't have s lot of straight friends and I've stood on the sidelines watching their lives play out quite often. And as I've offered my observations, I've had many a ""Barbie"" say, 'Yeah, I never thought of that,' when explaining how men think, and see things.<br><br>Because remember as we move forward in this discussion, for every Barbie out there, there is a Ken too. And it would indeed be interesting to see the movie, ""Ken,"" come out next. And have it written by a man. And not a man who is just trying be progressive and accepted by women. But a man who truly will give Ken's side of the story too.<br><br>So let's begin with the patriarchal thing. A deep and rather complex discussion to be sure.<br><br>Is there still a patriarchal mentality going on in this world? Of course. And there will continue to be for some time to come. The world doesn't just do a 180 because some movie called Barbie comes out and relegates men to some sort of inconsequential joke.<br><br>Nor did it immediately do a 180 just because women were becoming more vocal about their rights some 50+ years ago (even more when you consider the right to vote).<br><br>Just because we're living in a time when it's more acceptable, and cool for women to take jabs at men, doesn't mean change will be enacted overnight. Especially in light of the fact that there are still women out there who aren't ""terrified"" (to use that poster's word) of men and are perfectly fine letting them take the lead in a relationship, protect them when necessary, and do the things that men have done in relationships since the beginning of time. Remember, patriarchal societies have been around since the beginning of time, and you can't blame men for doing what they ALSO have seen as being expected of them. Many of these expectations coming from women themselves. Whether they'll admit to it or not.<br><br>For those who don't subscribe to the latter though, and want to become independent, and change that patriarchal trajectory, there are indeed alternatives. And I say, go for it. We're living in an age when women don't need men. They can be pretty much anything they want to be nowadays. Are there still ""ceilings"" to be shattered? Yes. But life really isn't that bad.<br><br>And what about the Barbie body image thing. For decades we've heard women complain about that impossible image that Barbie dolls have set for women. But the reality is that most men don't expect that in a woman. Not nearly as much as women might pretend or believe they do. That's more of a socialized, media construct that comes as a result of what the Barbie doll, and more generally, Hollywood and print media have set up. In the day to day world though, that's not how it is when it comes to what men expect in women.<br><br>Sure, men talk about good-looking women. They ogle women. Sometimes make a catcall or two. But women talk about good-looking men too. And when a good-looking man walks in the room, there is no denying what the women in the room think of him. Hell, I saw Aladdin on Broadway and when he came out without his shirt on, muscles bulging, the women in the audience went nuts. And in the play Take Me Out during the shower scene with a bunch of hot young men naked in the shower scene, the women in the audience weren't exactly suppressing their murmurings and ""responses."" So come on!<br><br>And to expand upon that, I worked at a major amusement park in Anaheim for almost ten years when I was younger. I was witness to thousands of couples. And I can tell you that I actually saw more couples where the man was better looking than the woman than I did where the woman was better looking than the man.<br><br>So no, men don't expect perfection.<br><br>Actually, from the observations I've made of women it would suggest that they do place a lot of importance on looks and physique when it comes to a man too. They can pretend that they don't, and that it's the men who have these impossible expectations of women, but it doesn't change the facts.<br><br>In the movie, we see Barbie's perspective on things. So, this is how Ken sees it in the real world too: women want a man who is good looking, has a great body, has a full head of hair. And oh yeah, if he has a lot of money, even better.<br><br>And add to that you have women who have special interests such as a man in uniform;. Or a younger man. I have female friends who will only date a guy in uniform. Etc.<br><br>So do women really want to play that ""expectations"" card?<br><br>I wouldn't suggest it. Because they are just as guilty as men. And any body self-image thing that women have is more Hollywood, and yes, Barbie-driven than what is the reality anyway. Because men are way more accepting than women claim them to be. Or I should say, straight men are. Gay men, not so much.<br><br>I will even add that men are so accepting of women, that ageism isn't even the issue that women play it up to be. Women complain about men who only want a younger, hotter woman and that women ""age out"" and are not treated with the same respect. To that I say bull. Let's say my 50 year old female friend and I go out for dinner, and our waiter is some hot younger man. If my friend has a thing for younger men and hits on him, depending on the moment in time, that friend of mine might very well have a date for the night.<br><br>I can tell you that as a gay male, that would not happen with that younger man if he was gay. If he played on my team and I made a play for him, there would only be a 5-10% chance I would have a chance at him. Because if you want to know what picky is, ask a gay man. Younger gay men won't hardly give the time of day to an older man.<br><br>So straight women benefit from this as well. There is no such thing as becoming too old. There are plenty of younger men who are willing and I'll bet where I'd have a 5-10% with the dude if he played on my team, she'd have an 80-90% chance with him if he was straight. Older gay men will not see the same willingness in younger gay men that straight women do in younger straight men. And even if the younger guy wasn't interested in an older woman, he would treat her with respect. The younger gay man will very likely put the older man down.<br><br>But I digress. Even though proven the point that women have nothing to complain about. Trust me.<br><br>In closing, are there Ken dolls who only want Barbie? Sure. But that's not the majority.<br><br>Do men appreciate a good looking woman with a nice body? Yes.<br><br>But women appreciate the same in men too, so time to move on from that discussion. Both men AND women have expectations of the opposite sex.<br><br>As to the patriarchal thing? Definitely a deeper and more complex subject.<br><br>But still, things have changed a lot for women. I know that patriarchal societies have been around for a long time. They have been the ""norm"" so to speak. And again, a lot of women are actually still okay with that. They don't mind the man taking the lead in ther relationship, protecting them, etc.<br><br>But for those who don't subscribe to that, women can now be the VP of the USA, or the prime minister or president of whole countries. We almost had a female president here in the States. Women can be CEOs, and even directors of movies. Some of the wealthiest people on this earth are women. All kinds of opportunities.<br><br>Even the opportunity to get your degree, get a nice job, and find a husband who has a lot of money, is totally hot, wears a uniform, is younger, or whatever. If the latter are your things too.<br><br>Women have nothing to complain about. Looks, age, none of it matters as much as you think it does. For women, the Barbie syndrome may exist, but reality would suggest otherwise.<br><br>Now boo hoo for me, all of that really DOES matter when you're gay. LOL. Or COL (cry out loud).

" Wow, beautiful execution
","This movie represents in such a beautiful way what it is like to be a woman, and the grief we might feel growing up as one. I was so incredibly touched.<br><br>Margo's acting was excellent and she is the perfect fit for Barbie.<br><br>As well as Ryan. Perfect casting.<br><br>I genuinely felt overflowing with love for women and felt the need to hug or hold hands with those around me.<br><br>This movie did an excellent job making us women feel seen, not only as the 'girl boss' and other outdated feminist catchphrases, but also as the depth we have, and the devastating grief we feel when growing up as little girls into a world that wasn't as sympathetic as we initially thought it would be. Unfortunately it is mainly because of men and the patriarchy..
The thing with these type of movies is that a woman's perspective and a man's perspective are completely different.. most women I know that watched the movie felt as I did - love, grief, touched and understood.<br><br>The men that have watched the movie did love it as well (and some hated it because of toxic masculinity) but most of them weren't touched. And I think that made me a little heartbroken..
Other than that - it's truly is a feminist masterpiece.<br><br>I will definitely will be watching again.",10
" Somehow... It worked!
","Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.",7
" Overrate
","I love greta's movies and I was enjoying Barbie until 3/4 of the movie. The last 1/4 was BAD. I'm giving it a 5, which I feel generous.<br><br>The trama was ""funny"" but honestly not good enough.<br><br>I do love all the actors and America Ferrera is awesome.<br><br>I was looking forward to like it but the last part was so bad that I can't recommend anyone to watch it. And is not like the twist was bad, it was more like the trama wasn't good so there wasn't any ending that could improve it.<br><br>Summarizing, if you are not a Barbie or pink movies fan, don't watch it. Not even if you are bored.<br><br>If you like pink movies with no trama, watch it.",5
" Loved it!
","As we all know the title of the movie suggest fun, tons of 'cheesy' moments, drama and a lot of imaginations. I entered the theater expecting the same and placed all my expectations low and just go how the film flows. Surprisingly, it has a lot of funny moments in the film, at times 'silly', but it was all understandable and placed creatively and entertaining. Margot Robbie as ""Barbie"" was surely a perfect role of her, while Ryan Gosling as ""Ken"" did the same and he was more funnier as expected! Visual effects were cool to watch and soundtrack was for me, a phenomenal! People do see mixed reviewed after seeing it, but do see Barbie as a film and enjoy its ride!",8
" It was great but...
","I like the overall feeling of the movie. It was created so beautifully and with such care and creativity and love for the Barbie universe
It was also so silly and fun.<br><br>But it was alot and honstly a bit too long.<br><br>It was saying alot of what felt like important things but somehow it felt flat.<br><br>Maybe i just like a movie that just is a movie.<br><br>Though it is so understandalbe that in that Barbie universe they like to explore and acknowledge those huge subjects such as gender equality. In that veiw the small problem i have is they may have tried to hard and the story got lost a bit.<br><br>In the light of all that Someway somehow it becomes though fun a bit of an forgettable experience.<br><br>Ps. Tiny Spolier: What about the kens. There story made me feel Abit sad and I wanted a happier ending for them.",6
" I hated Barbie. Now there is the film poster in my room.
","I have never been a fan of Barbie: I found her too pink, too clichéd - until I watched this film. As the trailer suggested, this movie is for people who hate the legendary doll, so I gave it a shot. It was worth it: I seldom had that much fun in cinema.<br><br>Barbie lives her happy life in Barbieland, but as she develops a human consciousness, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality.<br><br>This movie is so much more than just funny, as it is political and not predictable. It discusses the influence of the doll on young girls: It criticizes Barbie's stereotypical body while acknowledging her for revolutionizing the way girls saw themselves.<br><br>""Because Barbie can be anything, girls can be anything"" is said throughout the film. As Barbie taught girls to be more than just mothers, this is true.<br><br>Margot Robbie has proved what a great actress she is. That makes her the perfect cast for Barbie, as you take her seriously and sympathize with her. Ryan Gosling as her counterpart is equally fitting. He provides the film with a great sense of humor that will leave you laughing out loud.<br><br>All in all, ""Barbie"" differs from the majority of movies that are produced in Hollywood right now, as it is refreshingly new, funny and surprising. Director and author Greta Gerwig has done a great job creating this hilarious summer movie.",9
" A great deal of fun, and kinda profound too
","This movie was just so fun to watch. I'm not personally a fan of barbie, never really played with them or interacted with the IP in anyway, but just the pure outlandish absurdity of this movie and the over-the-top acting... I couldn't stop laughing throughout most of the runtime.<br><br>Based on how the movie was marketed, I was 100% expecting to be pondering the question, ""what does it mean to exist?"" by the end. Well, the movie pondered the question, came to a conclusion, and then told me what that conclusion was in a way that was very clear and easy to understand. Personally, I like when a movie isn't exactly clear. I like when I have to dig a little, think about it, discuss it with other people. With Barbie, I felt no need for that. The message was crystal clear. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but it was just a little too on the nose for my taste.<br><br>All in all, a super fun watch. I saw this with my family. We bought popcorn, milkshakes, and it was a great time.",7
" It's Actually Fun to Be in a Barbie World
","Going into Barbie with having little to no expectations at all can be such a delight.<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's banter with one another, even when they are on their own, are so entertaining to look at, especially Gosling who seems to have a more fun in the movie and is indeed the funniest out of all the cast members.<br><br>That being said, everyone in the cast seem to be having fun in their own respective roles, living out Barbieland and the real world. But by far the standout would have to Kate McKinnon (Ghostbusters) and America Ferrera (How To Train Your Dragon), who both help Robbie's titular character when she is having an existential crisis.<br><br>As for the production design, it is without a doubt, the strongest aspect of the film, particularly in BarbieLand where it seemed like the production team really went all-out in making the world, not to mention how they really feel when young girls are playing with Barbie.<br><br>The film does carry a lot of themes of not just someone trying to overcome an identity loss but also how acceptance should start by loving yourself and not needing to live up to the norms set up by leaders.<br><br>They are thought-provoking including capitalist feminism (how ideas can make money instead of enjoyment), alongside the idea of growing up which is coming to terms with reality and letting go of the childhood you have cherished - which is well-represented in the fantasy and real world.<br><br>All the way through, as a comedy, even though some jokes did not land well, most of it are really funny and does put a smile on your face up until the very end.<br><br>Overall, Barbie continues to prove the amazing directing skills of Greta Gerwig (Little Women, Lady Bird) and alongside her writing craft with her husband Noah Baumbach. With this film alongside Oppenheimer, it is one of the standout films of 2023.",8
" There is fun to be had
","Barbie is not just a stereotypical Hollywood film to celebrate the well-known brand. But it dives in deeper into more self existence, gender equality and journey of life. The messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all, barring the Mattel Company staff scenes and characters that doest not land. They are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film . The third act feels over-bloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start. The actors , Robbie, Gosling &amp; Ferrera are standouts!",7
" Dawn, that flic was hollow
","I was very surprise as the film turned out to be a very hollow matter. Why did they stretch the ""Hello Barbie""-""Hello Barbie"" joke all over the movie. Running gag? This film was so boring, the jokes so unadventurous, the characters so flat. The film was the look and feel of a 20 minute-TV-show stretched to infinity. Ryan Gosling was cool, but in the wrong movie. Margot Robbie is beautiful. That's it. She squeezed exactly one characteristic out of the puppet. After watching the film a would have assumed it would make 20 bio at the box office. What was I wrong.<br><br>A very painful movie experience. God save us all if there's a barbie cinematic universe on the horizon.",3
" Amazing and fun
","I got into the theater with zero expectations, and I can only say I was very positively surprised.<br><br>I loved the comedy in this movie as I think I haven't had that much fun in a while. And the other thing I love about this is that because the movie is a goofy comedy, you don't have to take the everything too seriously and you just go with it, and you enjoy the comedic ride all the way through the movie.<br><br>On the other hand, the movie also provides a lot of criticism towards the many flaws in our society and all through the movie you find things, that reflect that, and I believe they are portrayed perfectly.<br><br>Without spoiling to much I would recommend the movie to anyone as on the one hand I think it produces a lot of important messages and on the other I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy the comedic experience.",9
" Great comedy movie, not much else.
","7.5/10: VERY GOOD<br><br>This movie is very strange, but also very fun, it is well crafted, well acted and the humour is amazing. But where this movie fails is when it tries to make itself seem like a very important movie (in some parts) when the overall tone is light-hearted comedy. The scenes when it is trying to prove that also seem overlong. But, those scenes are funny, as is the rest of the film. I also enjoyed the direction it took with this not really being a children's film.<br><br>Overall, i really enjoyed this movie, it has great humour, and great performances, but some scenes go on for too long. A very good and funny film.",7
" Literally the worst movie I have ever seen. (OK, maybe some preachy religious movies are worse, I give you that)
","You know that saying, ""show, don't tell""?<br><br>Well, somebody should inform the screenwriters.<br><br>This film literally has a narrator to introduce you to the plot by describing things.<br><br>The characters are there just to have them say what the screenwriters want to yell to the world: Unfortunately, that is just a distorted view of reality a never-ending, self-righteous adolescent-level commentary on social issues the writers clearly have little grasp on, but are nevertheless very upset about.<br><br>And the best part? The writers are so pompous that they literally thing that ""listening to their preachy tantrums (voiced by the actors in the movie), is all that it takes to ""wake people up"" and emancipate them.<br><br>If only we had the writers's wisdom sooner as a
Humankind, all wrongs would have been avoided /s.<br><br>But the thing that really solidified the incompetence of the script, is the ""4th wall breaking"", acknowledging that Margot Robbie is too beautiful to be portraying someone that would be saying what is being said.<br><br>Kind of meta, the writers realizing their failing script, but instead of improving it, they think that acknowledging the fact somehow makes it OK and smart.<br><br>I literally became dumber by watching this two hour high-school essay written by ""adults"" who think they know what's wrong in the world, but actually lack the basic mental capacity to recognize their naive worldview and incompetence.",3
" Honestly just what we need
","Normally when a movie is hyped up big time you can pretty much guarantee it's gonna be rubbish.<br><br>Honestly this is literally just what the world needed. But do you know what? If you didn't like it then fine! Maybe it was just what I needed!<br><br>I'm not a cheesy fan in films but this did it so right. Honestly I was laughing so hard then nearly crying the next. It was a rollercoaster of a ride that I didn't know I needed in my life. I came out there thinking it was brilliant what I didn't expect was me driving home trying to stop myself from crying. I know it sounds dramatic but if you got it, you know.<br><br>Ryan gosling I knew he was a great actor but my god he took up a whole other comedic value and wasn't embarrassed in doing so! He was pure perfection in the role of Ken.<br><br>Obvs Margot Robbie. No words needed.<br><br>I loved the script. I loved the direction, I loved all the actors involved.<br><br>Honestly just pure barbie perfection. Chefs kiss.<br><br>Let me go off and drink wine and now go cry.",9
" Funny. Heartwarming.
","In spite of the crying child in the movie theater, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I did not know what to expect going in. I was pleasantly surprised and found myself giggling at each unexpected turn of the story. It was hilarious watching Ken become infatuated with the patriarchy and then quickly shifting to find Barbie coming to terms with the pains of reality kept me on my toes. And these two competing outlooks found a beautiful synthesis at the end. Funny. Heartwarming. I learned more about Barbie than I ever thought I would. I didn't even know about all the different outfits you could buy for your Barbie. And I am now aware of the existence of Mattel. Hopefully whoever runs their company is doing a better job than Will Ferrell.",7
" A fun enthralling journey
","You will experience vast emotions during this film. It's a thrill to watch, funny and fresh comedy. If I had any critiques for the film, I'd put them, but I enjoyed watching and will rewatch it. I felt like a little kid again at the movies. Totally absorbed with the story. It's a fictional land, while the film is so raw. Margot Robbie is a joy to watch and showed an impressive performance. I believed she was Barbie. The movie is played out as if the characters are dolls being played with. I imagined being a kid with my dolls, thinking of similar outrageous plots, dialogue, and wardrobe changes. Anyone can enjoy this film.",10
" Bar enheimer
","So we wanted to have our own Barbenheimer and after weeks after we saw Oppenheimer we went to Barbie.<br><br>We liked the colorful, trashy looking Barbie World. It just burned the eyes becaus of the colorful play.<br><br>The cast was great Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are the perfect Barbie and Ken<br><br>Nobody cares about Allen<br><br>The soundtrack was also great<br><br>We liked the social critical aspect but sadly the themes they criticisied werent taking deeper but just threatened superficial<br><br>Also a lot of Jokes werent that fllg or that banger<br><br>And some Jokes were very repetitive
also the Musical moments where at the end too much same the too much long scene with the creator of Barbie.",7
" So Deep, I am Surprised😁
","Barbenheimer? Who is the winner? Actually, when I though about it, their are two completely different movies. Both of them are great, I will tell you why this movie is great, but the main point is that you can't just compare this two movies. Anyway, Greta Gerwig did an absolutely amazing job, and I was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was. This is not made for kids, even if you could think this would be for kids, but no. Some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand.<br><br>The good things about Barbie is the valuable moral itself. They show you that the world and humanity, isn't perfect, and it is never going to be perfect, you just have to focus on how you are now. They showed how women were treated in centuries, and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women, strong, reckless and to never show their feelings. That is something I wouldn't expect from this movie, I was very surprised, and the representation of men, Ken (Just Ken) as the main Ken played be Ryan Gosling, he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour.<br><br>Margot Robbie was the second big star, or the first, both of them were amazing, but she played with such a feeling and emotion. When Barbie, the main Barbie played by Margot, discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect, and that not everyone are like her, she was completely off. Margot Robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in. Besides the actors, the storytelling, scenography and music soundtrack was amazing. Sometimes it was a bit too much screaming, but that's not the point, this movie was awesome!<br><br>This is a movie for everyone. If you like Barbie, this movie is for you, if you don't like Barbie, this movie is for you. This is a movie made for everyone, everyone can enjoy it, and I can't really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden. This movie offers you so much moral, entertainment, and I think this was a great movie.",9
" Funny with some great acting. Too preachy.
","A movie that delivered a great few laughs, with Gosling taking the show. Margot was fantastic, really showcasing her talent as an actor. However, for the main character of the show it did not seem that way - Ken took most of the limelight. Rightfully so with Ryan playing a stellar part.<br><br>The story starts off light hearted and fun but takes a dive with preaching against the patriarchy. While granted in this day and age, there's a limit to the level of guff one can take.<br><br>A colourful and fun movie that always tries to be more than it can be. Probably not a good idea to bring young kids as the premise and message will go over their heads.",6
" Men are trash, but now make it pink
","Before I start this review, let me start by saying that I used to be a staunch feminist. I'm certain that once upon a time, this film would have been right up my alley. I would have been nodding along with America Ferrera's infamous 30-min monologue in the second act (was it thirty minutes? It felt like thirty minutes). I would have been cheering when the women finally wrested back power. I would have been disgusted at the instatement of the patriarchy in Barbieland.<br><br>Now, this sort of narrative tires me, especially when it's so cringy and on the nose. I was expecting true woman power out of this film - a glorification of all that it means to be a woman, especially since Barbie has always been the epitome of femininity. Instead, we have the same repackaged message that being a woman is a torturous, inferior experience, and that you must escape it at all costs. We have the same narrative that men are literal trash and that they will succumb to their basest instincts at first chance.<br><br>Really, we have the same old, same old: ""Women can do it all"" - we cannot - ""Women don't need men"" - yes, we do - ""Men are asinine, useless, selfish, and egoistic"" - sure, like all women are, if we're making generalizations - ""Loving others by serving them is demeaning"" - serving others is the ultimate form of love and should be uplifted, appreciated, and glorified. Instead, this film shows women in maid costumes to make the point that serving others is h0rribl3!!!11!<br><br>We were supposed to get a visceral reaction to this image of women as maids - and I did, because it was so artless, cringy, and reductive - and make the connection that the patriarchy enslaves us. What the patriarchy does is simply split labor. Men outside the home, women within. Is that inherently bad? Or does it simply make sense based on men's and women's distinct strengths, at least historically? We must question. You will likely have a different answer than I.<br><br>I liked some of the messages at the beginning, namely that women are so often subject to impostor syndrome. That was beautiful, but then later on the film takes it upon itself to trample men to ""uplift"" women. I did not feel uplifted. I felt betrayed and pandered to, except I was the wrong crowd. It ignores the hardships of being the dominant sex: Being expected achieve, perform, earn more, lead, provide, protect, wear an emotionless facade. In some respects, women have it easier than men.<br><br>When America Ferrera, whom I just want say I adore, was doing her monologue on how it sucks to be a woman due to what's expected of us, all I could think was, ""Yes. There are certain expected behaviors of both women and men. It's called basic public decency and decorum.""<br><br>For instance, men are expected to be dominant and aggressive, but not so aggressive as to be frightening. Men are expected to hide their emotions, but not be emotionless brutes. If we started on this route, we could pick apart just about anything.<br><br>This sort of monotone, flat representation of our complex human experience works well to get a crowd fired up, but it's ultimately reductivist. I walked away feeling like the director thought I was stupid.<br><br>What I did like was the aesthetic, the much more subtle commentary on American consumerism, and the representation of teenagers are oversensitive militants. That's it.",3
" Tremendous Fun that's full of heart
","First, no actress on earth could have done this role other than Margot Robie. She's as if Barbie came to life (spoiler alert-she does). Margot is incredible in this. From the 2001 inspired opening (which had me laughing my head off) to when she's depressed and appears to be Barbie left behind by a little girl. The stiff legs, the arms, the way she rolls over-hysterical. The rest of the cast, especially America Ferrara, carry the story well and no one, no one is laughing at being in the movie. There are many, many Barbie related easter eggs, including one my wife pointed out to me: The interior of America's car is the same color as one of the original Barbie cars. The movie is fun without being preachy and if you pay attention-you may just learn something. One last thing, the great Dame Helen Mirren narrates! Go see it and have fun.",8
" Beautifully performed, but little charm
","Yet I loved the performances from both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and the incredible aspects of feminism and battling misogyny, I felt untouched by the film at some points. Mainly most of the characters in the 'Real World' - For example; Will Ferrell's character was completely useless and didn't add much to the film as a whole, and DEAR GOD did Connor Swindells contribute absolutely nothing to this film. Personally it got to the point where I felt as if this film should've just been a biopic about Ruth Handler, plus Rhea Perlman's performance as Ruth Handler was just exciting and very heartfelt/heartwarming at the same time.<br><br>Just overall, Most aspects of the film I did enjoy, it was just little things here and there, useless characters, messy writing and dialogue and the ""joke"" about Zack Snyder's Justice League didn't sit well with me.<br><br>I will say I did like this film, I just didn't LOVE it.",6
" Let down by all the hype
","Not a fan. Went in with fairly high expectations but was let down by the emptiness of it all. Sure, it has a solid message of empowerment of women but why is it so boring? Will Farrell was visibly strained trying to make something of his underwritten and unfunny part. Margo Robbie didn't have enough to do for much of the film. Only Ryan Gosling had a complete character arc. I had two central problems: first, I had no idea this was such an infomercial for Mattel which never fails to get their logo into nearly every frame, even during the end credits. If someone in the company had written the first draft, I would have believed it. Second, the ""rules"" of this made-up world were vague and constantly changing. The filmmakers ripped off Wes Anderson's settings but didn't comprehend the unity in his designs, stories, and performances. Wes Anderson always feels like he's about to break the fourth wall but never does. ""Barbie"" kept breaking it over and over so that it was near impossible to fully immerse yourself in its world. I'm glad for a female director to now be empowered, but I would have liked to see a much more coherent vision.",5
" this is the movie of humanity
","I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie. Loved this movie.",10
" Cerebral and Extremely Fun; Not Without Its Flaws
","I saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience. However, I've needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that I wasn't sure how to feel about. First, Ken. The character himself was hilarious and Ryan Gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice. I loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking, (like, the guy just wanted to learn about horses! But pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere, so Ken, being naive, just falls into it), as well as the societal expectation of *needing* to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent, leading into incel ideology.<br><br>The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how in the end, after he became his normal self, it felt as if the movie just expected me to be laughing along with him again... like, I still don't wanna be rooting for this guy. Seeing people's response to him as a character after the movie had me confused. I understand, Ryan Gosling is so fine, but Ken is not your babygirl! He still tried to install a patriarchal state and never really apologized!!<br><br>The plot with the real-world Mattel executives also just felt a little unnecessary to me. It was funny, don't get me wrong, but it just kind of happened and I wasn't sure what to glean from it. At one point I found myself thinking, like, what happened to those guys?? And then they just kinda showed up at the end. I also know it was meant to be commentary on Mattel's predominantly male leadership, but... like, YOU are Mattel. You have a male CEO. Like thanks for addressing it, but you have no room to talk.<br><br>I think some of the time with this unnecessary plot point could've been used to touch a bit more on body image issues, because that is a HUGE criticism of the Barbie brand. Like, okay. You had one token fat Barbie with an otherwise entirely straight-sized cast. But some of the jokes were just like ""pregnant people are weird 😂"" and they never entirely said ""hey cellulite is not scary its just how it happens""
I think they *tried* to do something about aging being beautiful but it was not really explicit enough to come across. I think it could've been pretty easy to incorporate a scene, like when Barbie tried tea for the first time, to be like wow! Indulging in pleasures with your food is good and not an indicator of your moral value!<br><br>Despite my criticisms, I would say this movie is a must-watch. The points it makes are really important. And I actually found the comedy funny instead of cringe, which is rare for me with these types of films!<br><br>More of a 7.5/10 than a 7, if I had to say.",7
" Surprising and Full of Surprises
","As I said at the beginning of the article, I lost my expectations before watching the movie because of the trailers. It felt like they were going on a story, especially one that would end up with big problems in the future. I will continue to watch an average movie when the analogies made on the internet seem to confirm my suspicions. But Barbie is hiding with a pretty well-written script. He uses drama in the parts that should be serious, and humor in the parts. From that moment on, the script can be both preserved and conveyed to the audience much better. Moreover, when the editing is at a fluent pace, you watch the movie breathlessly. The fact that its duration is under two hours is also nice considering the length of mainstream movies in recent years.",10
" Confusing message for dolls or humans?
","I enjoyed the film more for its choreography and the characters' sympathy than for the confusing message. Is it that Ken should understand he was created to be Barbie's friend forever? Is it that a man in love must surrender to a second place? I hope I can read the actual purpose of the story from the writers.<br><br>Barbieland is shown as a happy monotonous human-like world with empty containers resembling our not so happy monotonous real life where men condescend with a higher ranked male model, something a second rank character wished to be back at his fantasy world. Please, if anyone finds out the actual mess-age let me know.",7
" Not flawless by any means but it does (k)enough to make its point
","Things I didn't like:
The over the board marketing and publicity (esp about the IP products)
Lack of subtlety.<br><br>Feels too preachy at some points.<br><br>The Mattel scenes were little too silly.<br><br>Like:
Satire hits hard most of the time.<br><br>Unapologetic and audacious approach.<br><br>A Strong message and way it is delivered.<br><br>The mother-daughter dynamics (at most times).<br><br>Production design and color pallets.<br><br>Margot Robbie and our guy Ryan almost perfectly playing their parts.<br><br>Greta Gerwig's direction.<br><br>Now onto some spoiler-y bit:<br><br>I think most people just want to gets triggered without putting much thought behind this. They missed the main point.<br><br>We have to remember that it is a satire and both the Barbie Land and Real World are extreme representations of polarity which is not what we need. I think it does well to deliver the message of why individuality is more important.<br><br>Also I support how at the end how they didn't just give the Kens the equal status in the councils or whatever because at the end of the day at that very moment, in that fictional world the Barbies were more qualified (by design) to hold those positions and all the Kens have just been are side characters with no ""real"" talents other than being the eye candys to the Barbies. Upliftment on basis of gender and not merit/talent is never a sign of a healthy society . But from now onwards it will not be ""Barbie...and Ken"" but ""it's Barbie and it's Ken"". I think this was the first step towards that balanced and independent world.<br><br>3.5/5 + 0.5 stars for the sheer audacity to bring forth such a daring topic at such a scale. It will be a 3rd/4th in my list of Greta Gerwig's work.",8
" A fun watch with your partner
","Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude, but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema. The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.<br><br>At its best, the movie is decent. The acting overral is commendable, especially with Margot Robbie delivering a great performance and being a good fit for her role. Some scenes are enjoyable and endearing, capable of eliciting laughter and providing a good time, but they don't leave a lasting impact. The soundtrack, from my perspective, was consistently great throughout the film with just a couple odd choices.<br><br>However, my main issue with the movie lies in its overt push of social and political views onto the audience. Instead of letting the viewers interpret the themes on their own, the film explicitly spells out its messages, which can be off-putting. The movie seems too focused on trying to please every audience, resulting in a predictable Hollywood cliché.<br><br>Moreover, it appears that the film fails to cater to two significant demographics. Younger viewers might struggle to follow the movie and comprehend its messages, leaving them disconnected and confused. On the other hand, older audiences, who would have been the main target for nostalgic appeal, may find this aspect lacking in the film, missing an opportunity to connect on a deeper level.<br><br>In summary, while Barbie can be enjoyable when approached with the right mindset and company, the movie falls short of meeting expectations. The strong performances and some fun moments are marred by heavy-handed messaging and a failure to deliver the nostalgia that fans were hoping for.",7
" Extremely OVER HYPED
","Definitely not understanding why this movie was over hyped. What age demographic is this movie for exactly? It's not a movie for little kids. Maybe pre teen girls? And I can't understand how they wouldn't be bored with this film. It's music every couple of mins and everything is way over the top. Actors were great but the script isn't entertaining at all. Honestly the trailer was more fun than the movie. My kids were bored and wanted to leave before the end. But after we made it through the first half of the movie, we might as well suck it up until the end. All in all, an amazing cast and set, but it falls short in actually entertaining the audience.",4
" Barbie May Not be Wrapped in Plastic but She's Definitely Fantastic
","The Barbie movie got a lot of buzz from critical praise but I was intrigued even before that because there were stories about how it had quite the journey through development. I don't know what the previous versions would have looked like but I wanted to start with how Greta Gerwig's version is structured. It would have been pretty easy to play to formula writing and developing the script, to just repackage a popular framework and insert Barbie with some different touches (paint it pink and glam it up a little). But the creative team wasn't content to do just that here, my favourite part of Barbie is the unconventional directions the plot shoots off in. Barbie coming to the real world could have been predicted but the parallel journey of Ken, Barbie bonding with Gloria and Sasha, the odyssey that the Mattel executives go on are so off-kilter and fresh. It's all firmly tongue-in-cheek as well, the movie is deliberately poking fun at both itself and the system (including the corporate owners of the Barbie brand Mattel). Is there the occasional misstep? Sure, but this movie was so rare that while I could have nitpicked and poked at inconsistencies, I didn't want to. Barbie encourages you strap in for a ride and I can forgive the occasional bump in the journey if you deliver the goods. With such a silly tone and some well-intentioned rhetoric, Barbie absolutely does that and more.<br><br>In Barbie's debut, we travel to Barbieland, a candy coated toy-like version of reality that is perfectly curated to the needs of all the Barbies (and to a lesser extent all the Kens). The production design, costuming, sets, lighting are all dynamic and creative. The creative team does an excellent job of adding little touches to flesh out the world while maintaining the glossy veneer of the toys. The cars, the houses, the outfits are picture perfect and magnify how much money and effort clearly went into designing and creating this world. They use set dressing to great comedic effect too and it helps sell how strange and eerie coming to reality would be for our heroes.<br><br>Margot Robbie is pulling double duty as both the star and a producer in this feature. Robbie is her typical excellent self here, she's what the movie is centred around but she isn't afraid to share the spotlight with some of the other heavy hitters in the cast. She's as advertised in Barbie, she's funny, dramatic and magnetic all in equal measure. Ryan Gosling is really going for it as Ken, he's also underrated as a comedic talent. The jokes are fairly simple here but his enthusiastic delivery is what sets his work apart. Some people have mentioned awards consideration, I wouldn't go that far but he's great and he showed up to work. My favourite performance actually came from America Ferrera as Gloria. She's got great chemistry with both her on-screen daughter Sasha (played by an also great Ariana Greenblatt) and Robbie. She's playing more the everywoman in the minefield that is the world today with a frenetic energy that totally fits. I also wanted to congratulate Rhea Perlman, Will Ferrell (in a very President Business-esque turn), Issa Rae and Alexandra Shipp for some excellent work in their respective supporting roles as well.<br><br>Barbie has plenty to say and uses the platform effectively to get the message across. There's so much packed in here from how problematic it can be excelling as a woman in today's world, the fragility of the male psyche, how corporations flip-floppy attitude towards gender politics are based upon greed instead of the collective good etc. Depending on the scene, some of the material is delivered in a more subtle manner than in others but I was continually impressed by how the creative team was able to get the message across while weaving it into the movie without coming across as too heavy-handed. I'll also concede that I felt like they got 80-90% of the way there instead of the whole 100% (there's still an aftertaste of non-equality at the end). But I'll also concede that I'm not the target demographic here, I completely approve of the movie in its completed form and I'm all for what the message is trying to say (woman power, working through insurmountable obstacles bit by bit, getting in touch with yourself through introspection and acts of kindness, shape your own standards for beauty etc.)<br><br>Barbie was a little uneven for me but I really enjoyed the overall package. Barbie is bold, vibrant, well-made and delightfully weird in the best of ways. The performances are great and I liked that despite it taking advantage of existing intellectual property, it stands out by being a self-contained story that doesn't hinge on a Mattel Cinematic Universe or suggest that there will be sequel after sequel. I want to tip my cap to Greta Gerwig and her team for subverting expectations and giving us an unconventional blockbuster experience. Go see Barbie in theatres if you get the chance.",8
" Visually appealing but 'meh'
","Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.<br><br>For the story itself - sure, there were some morals and statements presented but it was a bit flat and a lot of the same. I left feeling totally underwhelmed. Gosling was great though. A few bits did make me laugh but it struggled to hold my attention. As sometimes happens, a lot of the funny parts were in the film trailers. I wouldn't watch it a second time through.",6
" NO NO NO AND NO!.... So disappointing
","This had a great concept but utterly failed, couldn't understand why Barbie had to just be so mean to Ken. First part was good then just went downhill from there. We kept thinking when is this going to end. We laughed so hard over the movie being so pointless and the sheer stupidity of the storyline. The only best part was when Barbie told the old lady she was beautiful and of Ryan Gosling singing. I loved Barbies but not this way. Margot Robbie is a great actress and I have loved all her movies and she was a great Barbie, and I loved her emotions in the movie but the part was not scripted well for her. They made a fool of her and Ryan Gosling. The writers could have done so much more for these great actors in this movie.",4
" I didn't like it - but it was still a masterpiece

This movie didn't try to hide what it was or what it was doing - it showed you trailer to finish and I loved that .

" It was what I expected
","The title by no means suggests that this movie was predictable. Greta Gerwig does a wonderful job making the 1 hour and 54 minutes enjoyable for a wide range of audiences (which was originally a worry of mine, as a movie centered around the Barbie doll franchise seemed a narrow area of public interest). Rather, following countless pre-release trailers, interviews, promotions, and marketing schemes, I had a general idea of what the movie could be about. In other words, I was not left surprised or awed by new and unexpected artistic choices.<br><br>The movie I expected was a comedic, lighthearted adventure surrounding Barbie and her ""universe"" of Barbies and Kens (and Allan), a pink and perfect world of constant happiness and beauty, until something goes terribly wrong: Barbie starts becoming human. What would follow is a wacky adventure wherein Barbie would seek for a solution to her problem, and in doing so, finding what it means to be human; furthermore, what it means to be a woman in a ""world of men.""<br><br>And this is more or less the framework of Gerwig's film. Of course, there are many other creative aspects that were not anticipated, and the way it built off of a beloved franchise was admirable, to say the least, and clever. Though I was not a big Barbie fan as a child, there were all kinds of Easter eggs referencing Barbie lore throughout the movie. Many would say this film did Barbie and her fans justice.<br><br>Overall, I expected the film to be good. And that is what I thought of it: it was an enjoyable and entertaining movie, though would not be on a list of favorites.<br><br>It didn't move me in the way I believed it intended to. Some moments were emotional, but it did not leave me with profound thoughts on the state of modern-day patriarchy, or the hardened corporate heart of society. Perhaps this was because it was very well cushioned by comedic dialogue and colorful, fun design, successfully softening the blow of the movie's larger themes.<br><br>I also agree that it was quite preachy, and although there was power behind the speeches about the feminist struggle and the expectations of perfections in an imperfect world, it felt very heavy-handed (especially towards the end of the film).<br><br>Despite how I feel about Barbie not living up to its full potential, I encourage everyone to watch it. Not just because my opinion really doesn't mean anything among the experiences of others, but because it deserves a chance at changing another person's mind.<br><br>I fully support how Barbie encourages the breaking of gender norms and awareness and transparency about mental health. The arc Barbie follows is touching, brave, and familiar to all those experiencing the ups and downs of life's many paths. Ultimately, it is worth a watch, and certainly opens new doors for future filmmaking and marketing.",7

" AS A POWERLIFTING, MASCULINE MALE...
","I loved the laughs that I got out of this movie! Being able to make fun of yourself makes life so much better! The movie was very meta and definitely knew what it was doing. The feel did give slight first season of the office vibes every now and then, but it hit the message home! The main actors In Barbie and Ken were exactly what the movie needed. Will Ferrell showing up was kinda weird not gonna lie, but he did fit into his ""bumbling idiot in charge of everything"" role perfectly. I would also love to see other men step up and say they enjoyed this movie. It was like sitting through a good roast. We should also listen to the true message, and make way for a more equal world. Even for the stereotypical Barbie's, the weird Barbie's, and every Barbie in between. On to Oppenheimer!",7
" Laugh out loud funny
","Yikes if this movie offends you! 😂 I loved all the characters, the instructions and montages of how to get to the real world, the mom/daughter storyline, the depression ad lol, weird barbie, the horses, the physical comedy (showering, going down a slide), and great use of a really good Matchbox 20 song. 😂😂 Margot and Ryan are such standouts in this and the costumes are amazing. This movie is an instant classic! Such iconic moments and ideas. It is perfectly placed in 2023 and will be talked about for ages. Congrats to Greta and her team for achieving such an amazing box office opening weekend.",9
" Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" left me in tears, yet I find myself giving it a 6 out of 10 rating.
","The film's marketing portrayed it as a story about a doll entering the real world, but it surprisingly delves deeper into themes of feminism and patriarchy that were not adequately highlighted in the trailers. Had I not accidentally stumbled upon some spoilers before seeing the film, I would have been taken aback, expecting a more lighthearted and joyful adventure.<br><br>Instead, ""Barbie"" turned out to be a story that explores the value of women and their place in society. While the central idea is commendable, the execution fell somewhat short for me. The plot became predictable once the main theme was revealed, and I could foresee the unfolding events and the movie's conclusion.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the movie's core message is strong, but I couldn't fully embrace its realization. I agree with the critics' observations regarding the one-dimensional portrayal of male characters and the lack of true equality in the ending, despite the intentions.<br><br>Still, ""Barbie"" has several strengths. The visual style is captivating, and the beauty of Barbieland is truly enchanting. In addition, the actors deliver commendable performances that add depth to their characters.<br><br>On the downside, some of the characters who are not dolls themselves seem a bit too childish in their behavior, which detracts from the overall balance. Also, the treatment of the Kens raised some concerns and left room for improvement.<br><br>In conclusion, ""Barbie"" tackles an important and relevant issue, but it could have been executed more effectively. Despite its shortcomings, the movie manages to leave an emotional impact thanks to its captivating visuals and strong performances.",6

(Matel CEO), Simu Liu (Ken), and Kingsley Ben-Adir (Ken).<br><br>Directed by Greta Gerwig and written by; Noah Baumbach and Gerwig-the crisis in Barbie (2023) is that Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.<br><br>There are several highlights to the Barbie Movie. Ben-Adir (Ken) changed his voice to that of Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as his Marvel Cinematic Universe Character named Gravik. Only several men in the cinema understood the MCU reference. Speaking of men-Barbie references male dominance in the real world as something that is concealed by men obtaining Phd degrees and certifications. Moreover, men are portrayed as fools in this movie. Gloria played by America Ferrera has a husband who struggles with the Spanish language and the Ken's think more with the head on their groin areas rather than their heads with a brain in it.<br><br>All in all Barbie is a good movie for women empowerment, I give it a 5/10. Nonetheless, if a Barbie movie universe was created then I would most likely support it for the funny male depictions.",5
" unexpectedly profound
","Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.",9
" Barbie (2023) - Surprisingly Heartwarming and Entertaining!
","When I first heard about the release of ""Barbie"" in 2023, I must admit I didn't have high expectations.

However, I was in for a pleasant surprise!<br><br>The direction of the film was truly on point. It managed to take a simple concept and turn it into a captivating story with well-paced storytelling.

It touched on friendship, self-discovery, and the importance of staying true to oneself - messages that resonate not only with children but also with adults.<br><br>In conclusion, ""Barbie"" surpassed my expectations and delivered an enjoyable and heartwarming cinematic experience. It's a movie that manages to entertain with its humor and engaging storytelling, while also providing valuable life lessons.

" Glad I watch this movie, fantastic!
","Even though she is only a doll, she does not have to be an airhead. Here in lies ""Lady Bird"" filmmaker Greta Gerwig's creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America's most recognizable toys to life on screen. When you add that to the decision to cast Margot Robbie in the lead role, ""Barbie"" is off to the right, flawlessly arched start.<br><br>Barbie's aspirational charm contributes to her brand's strength. Barbie has been criticized for imposing unattainable beauty standards, but she also served as a reminder to girls that everything is possible because different models have depicted her as the president, a rocket scientist, and even transgender. Do you know who else has inflated ideals of beauty? Celebrities in movies. They act as role models, much like Barbie, which is why Gerwig's interpretation of the wildly successful toy brand is so creative.<br><br>While making Ryan Gosling's dumb Ken the brunt of most of its gender-equity humor, this film hits all the appropriate criteria. The result is a very funny children's film with the phrases of a first-year liberal arts student, which tosses around terms like ""patriarchy"" and ""appropriation"" - pretty much everything but ""problematic,"" which the film means without actually referring to Barbie's legacy.<br><br>The script by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach feels most audacious on this front. The hit movie ""Barbie"" openly accuses the best-selling doll of undermining the women's movement in addition to making light of Mattel.<br><br>With a subject like this, the power of nostalgia shouldn't be understated, since much of Gerwig's approach affects mature women and homosexual audiences who have owned the dolls - and for whom she has concealed references and deep-cut facts throughout. Even though Gerwig occasionally uses the film as the vehicle for what seems like a gender studies lecture for undergraduates, it is evident that the movie was created by professionals who understand how children's imaginations develop while playing with Barbies.",8
" Great acting, horrific plot.
","I found this film to be disappointing and and an overall letdown, to say the least.<br><br>The humour, acting, soundtrack, casting &amp; costumes were AMAZING. Don't get me started on the dance choreography and the sets. I found that those aspects really created an amazing atmosphere for what the perfect Barbie world is was intended to be. Michael Cera was absolutely hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing at the broken barbie, played by Kate McKinnon.<br><br>Nevertheless, although it was clear they were trying to exaggerate the message on purpose, I found the plot to be just.. stupid. Barbie fights the patriarchy, or, Ken on a horse. I found the humour during multiple points in the movie to be dry, especially stressing how much Ken loves horses.<br><br>The ending, I found to be mushy. I was expecting something better, and just kind of felt let down. Almost like it was lazy.<br><br>In conclusion, I'd give this movie a solid six out of ten. It's kind of sad, as I am the targeted audience for this film- a young, feminist, progressive woman. Don't get me wrong, this movie was great at parts- but, in the end, was definitely overhyped.",6

" Surprises You, Entertains You
","One might think this is a girly movie made for teenage girls and may be the early 20s. It starts off misleading the audience into a fun filled ride of jokes and conscious silliness at the start.

At one point you think whether it's an adaptation of ""Men are from Mars..."" book, because they hit you deeper than the laugh you make of the dialogue.<br><br>The subtext I gather is, the film is about a rich good looking girl who is living her hunky dory life where everything is spik and span. This girl has been metaphored as the Barbie. The girl who understands little of the real world until life hits her with ugly truth (revealed at the end) and she starts feeling real pain and emotions. At first she denies it and fights it and also gets it all back for a brief moment.

" A Missed Opportunity for Empowerment
","Barbie 2023 had the potential to be an empowering film, but it ultimately fell short of its promise. While the actors' performances were commendable, the overall message conveyed by the movie was misleading. Instead of celebrating feminine power, it seemed to portray a narrative of feminine revenge and hostility towards men. This approach left little room for nuanced exploration of gender dynamics and empowerment.<br><br>One of the major shortcomings of the film was its portrayal of male characters. They were depicted as one-dimensional and often treated poorly, almost like brainless toys. This portrayal not only perpetuated stereotypes but also missed an opportunity for a more balanced and thoughtful exploration of gender relationships.<br><br>Furthermore, the movie's attempts at humor often fell flat. There were very few scenes that genuinely elicited laughter from the audience, leaving the overall tone of the film feeling somewhat dry and uninspired.<br><br>The most disappointing aspect of Barbie 2023 was its failure to depict women in a more genuine and multifaceted light. Instead, it seemed to promote a stereotypical ideal of perfect, fake, and emotionless women. This portrayal missed the opportunity to showcase the complexities, strengths, and vulnerabilities that real women possess.<br><br>In conclusion, while Barbie 2023 had the potential to be an adventurous and funny film that celebrated feminine power, it ultimately missed the mark. Its portrayal of gender dynamics and humor left much to be desired, and it seemed to promote a stereotypical image of women that does not reflect the diversity and depth of real women's experiences.",2
" A JOLLY LIFE IN PINK IS GLITTERING & HEART-STIRRING
","Greta's satire that evidently seems like a promotion run of Mattel's creations, is beyond the pink dazzle. The sugary-adorable pastels, mostly the pink colour spreads all over the dreamy world of Barbie. Everything that makes it fancy, fizzy and fantastic are the production designs and costumes. Ebullience is lightened by the sparkling musical sequences. The Fabulous Margot Robbie as Barbie is the eminence of this Greta's clever and creative vision. The Cast is typically perfect to saturate in the fantasy. Ryan Gosling charmingly lends a kenergy in the story. The ridiculous banters strives all the way, sometimes little silly but mostly unveils the story's themes. There's a brief mention of Mattel's creation &amp; how they flawed at a place when they aimed to represent a powerful figure. There's a slight malfunction between the fantasy and real world that alters different ideologies to flourish in the fun and laughs. The ideologies shapes into leading an unresolved fragment of humankind. The two contrasting portraits, the Patriarchy &amp; Feminism comes in a fairy tale that once again liberalise the women and evokes them to voice up for themselves and their dilemmas &amp; demands for a treaty for their existence and admiration which is partly void in the flawed-society. The sweet messages are beneath the glaring pink world, that adds a soul in the story. Barbie's exploration in finding the answer to the malfunction leads to many errands along the way. She realises the elegance of tears, her purpose and worth, being imperfect is normal and ultimately the self-discovery immerses in the conclusion. A pink jest is a celebration of womanhood as the flashes of memories flow. Gradually it reaches to hearts of millions with its resembling storytelling. It turns into a tender-mellow tale of Barbie, growing up to understand the sentiments of a human much more. Indeed this elegantly crafted and insightfully written tale drives to a sentimental ending. The heart would be pink, the tears would be pink, hereby you'll love pink.",8
" Started Strong But Ended Weak
","The Barbie movie was overall highly enjoyable. The costumes and sets were great and added to the Barbie nostalgia. Ken was probably my favorite part, watching him go through the ups and downs of unrequited love, and finally finding himself outside of Barbie at the end of the movie. I even enjoyed the over-the-top portrayal of the patriarchy. It was hilarious. However, I felt the ending fell flat. Maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse, but I felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the Kens, to the point that it didn't feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all. It felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the Kens and laughing it off as funny. Sure, they gave them some minor administrative role at the end, but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong. Like it ended with the Barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women. Not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth. It happened as part of the finale. The final focus of the film. Overall, I highly enjoyed the movie, but the ending really made me leave feeling let down.",7
" An comment about feminism, men & gender equality
","An film that tries to balance out humor and leaving social criticism in the minds of the viewers. Barbie falls flat with its criticism not only because it feels flat and out of place, but most importantly unnatural and unimportant.<br><br>Why does a film about a female toy that kids play with need to comment on feminism. The use of feminism is to give a woman the right to choose for themselves and to be what they want, for example no woman nowadays should be a housewife if they do not want it to be. There are still current problems such as loans, the pay gap shouldn't be a thing, that is where gender equality is important, but Barbie gets it wrong and simply criticizes the mental state of being a woman and having it hard in its own life and still try to cover it up and being controlled by men. While I know that this is a problem in some cultures and countries, it is not the ones that people watch this film in. And Barbie definitely doesn't means it in that way.<br><br>Ken plays the stereotypical men, he wants to rule and fulfill himself in his life, and he searches for meaning. His character development ends with him needing to let go of Barbie to truly find himself, and Barbie says that he wasn't created only to be Barbie's boyfriend, but truly, he was. No one bought a ken toy without a Barbie toy, so why can't we let the toys that girls play with, be toys they play with?<br><br>Barbie sees the Real world as an issue because she thinks it only gets controlled by men, but she doesn't see that barbie land is a place which has a woman dictatorship.<br><br>I was prepared for an fun time with laughs, but was rather left devastated by this film, because it tries to criticize how we treat feminism and gender equality, but then it gets it wrong, and finds problems where they is none. It rather comes across as the message, woman are good, men are bad. This is not the type of film that would inspire a little girl to be something special, this is the type of film she doesn't even understand or care for.",4
" One of the most real and complex movies I've seen.
","Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.<br><br>I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand. But the movie brought so much more depth and substance. Be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions!",10
" Mixed Bag: Good Moments, Simplistic Themes
","As far as I'm concerned, the first half of the movie was simply boring to me, and the attempts at humor on that level were just UGH. Yes, the message is fine, though very simplified - men bad, women good. I agree that equality is important, and I liked the conclusion that Kens need to find their own purpose. Of course, I didn't miss the gay undertones with the Kens (flexing on the beach with beers and the Grease-like choreography where a black and yellow Ken give Gosling kisses on the cheeks and then shake it off with a ""what was that"" - I'd gladly pay a ticket for that action 😜), and there's also a gay vibe with Allan and the cubicle guy from Mattel... I also liked Weird Barbie and Ruth. The Mattel board was a very coarse caricature to me.<br><br>All in all, a ""mixed bag"" - there are good moments, but the bad ones outweigh them for me. I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't do it again.<br><br>It's symptomatic to me that an Oppenheimer barely collects 650 million, and these guys double that, and it'll probably be even more...
And that bit at the end with the gynecologist... I expected Barbie to get a job at Mattel as the new Ruth, but no: the message to the girls was to go to the gynecologist... facepalm....",6
" Surprisingly Amazing For Everyone!
","Barbie was honestly a pleasant surprise, I went as a joke thinking it would be stupid but ended up loving the movie. The acting and humour were perfect and everything was so well done. The storyline was incredibly good for a movie about dolls and I am honestly impressed. The soundtrack was great and the songs sung were even better. The effects and sets were perfect for the theme and plot and it just worked so well. I absolutely loved it and hope it does well at the box office because it deserves so many awards. Margot Robbie, great. Ryan Gosling, amazing. Michael Cera, better than ever. Will ferrel, yes! John Cena, best character. Great movie everyone should watch!!!",10
" Good Cinematography, Delusional Plot and Message
","Very entertaining, and fun. Does not take itself too seriously. Very good satirical acting. Props, and set building is very creative and in-depth. Ryan Gosling is great, and really funny. The plot and message are annoying though. Starts from the beginning with a very delusional message, and does not let up. Even though I tried to ignore the very delusional message throughout, the ending makes no sense. Barbie herself ends up not solving her problem, still being confused, and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie. That makes no sense whatsoever. The very last line of dialogue is a fail of a joke too. The director obviously did not know how to end the movie.",7
" Truly fantastic
","It was a literal cinematic master piece. It was comedic, touching, educational, ground breaking.<br><br>It touches upon feminism, misogyny, patriarchy, women's relationship with themselves.<br><br>It showed a utopia run by women, Barbie land wasn't perfect, the kens were ignored but not hated, undervalued but not sexualized.<br><br>In a world meant to mirror patriarchy, we saw a difference in treatment that really opened people's eyes.<br><br>It also highlighted how the patriarchy is toxic to all involved including men, it touched on the lack of emotional intelligence men have, it highlighted toxic masculinity and overall critique of how men and women have been interacting with each other since the beginning of time.<br><br>The hardest thing about watching this movie is knowing that there will be a group of people who interpret this as ""hate"" when it couldn't be further from the truth and the audience who rejects the messages this film shows are the group of people who need this education the most.<br><br>The best part of this movie was seeing women of all ages come to the movie theater to laugh, cry and wake up mentally, together.<br><br>Overall this movie shows the struggle of women and girlhood in a patriarchal society and how it not only demeans women but strips men of their validity, forcing men to grow up disconnected from their emotions and experiences of others and how important it is to bridge the gap between genders to create a BETTER world not just for women but for men as well.<br><br>This film is truly for everyone and powerful enough to change the trajectory of society. Fantastic film.",10
" Surprisingly well-layered
","Barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes, challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist. The main standout truly is the costume design. Highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the Barbie concept. Borrowing elements from the Chanel's haute couture collection, to some of the rarest outfits from Barbie, it was such a unique experience to observe such understated works of art; even the extras/minor characters were wearing beautiful pieces. Some of the best costume design I've seen over the years.<br><br>The plot was rather textbook, but definitely enjoyed the witty subtle jokes which created good tension and suspension. Well-balanced and great character development for most characters except for Sasha who changed opinions just too quickly for my taste.",7
" Don't believe the hype
","Rarely have I seen a film that can be so heavy handed with its messaging and at others totally confusing. The script is an utter mess, and I felt sorry for the poor parents that brought kids along to what was very much an adult film. The 'real world' was no more real than Barbieland and can anyone explain the point of Will Ferrells character or why he needed to go to Barbieland.<br><br>Very few films have I every wanted to end so badly and this one ended so, so badly with the inclusion of the ghost of the Barbie maker just to hammer home a few more points in case you missed them. Just don't believe the hype or the positive reviews, this film is the worst film I've seen since in a long, long time.",1
" Amazing
","Me and my friend have been dying to see this film for months, we thought it would be a funny silly movie but its was so much more.<br><br>There were so many emotional scenes that left me on the verge of tears the ending scene was honestly so incredibly emotional but it was amazing.<br><br>Margot robbie was an amazing casting choice she played the role of barbie so fantastically, the casting choice for ken could have been better but honestly ryan gosling did amazing at his role aswell.<br><br>Honestly this movie healed my inner child it was so amazing and i definitely recommend you go and see it because the movie actually is very funny but you probably will end up tearing up at some point.",10
" good movie but nothing special
","Good movie but nothing special. Good quality, funny and this all. After leaving the cinema, I had the feeling that I was watching a long corporate propaganda about Barbie. But that was probably it. Clearly Mattel wanted to improve the opinion of Barbie dolls based on feminist themes and the problem of gender inequality. However, there is a strong feeling that this topic was used as a marketing manipulation. Good cast and acting, film for both children and adults. Lots of references to barbie doll jokes. Margot Robbie played really great here, without her this movie would be much weaker.<br><br>If you go to the cinema, you will probably be satisfied, but if you don't go, you won't lose anything. Strong 6.",6
" Wish i liked it more
","The hype and marketing drag me to this movie. I felt a little disappointed. Even though I did not had high expectations. It was not a bad movie. But it clearly isn't deserving that 7+ from me that it has now (in my opinion). The beginning is so strong but towards the end it's getting more disappointing. Great acting, great visuals/colors but sadly a very bad story. And yes the end is nicely done. But overall.. Not so great. Probs to the creators of reaching this milestone with great marketing and all the hype around it like tiktoks. Just watch it at home on a sunday where you wanna clear your mind a bit and have a little laugh.",4
" PERFECT
","At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés.",10
" Close Kenough
","7.5/10
First of all, I really loved this movie. I think it's fun and entertaining and I really think it's done with a lot a passion for the original material. The references are clever and I couldn't help but smile each time I saw a Barbie I had as a child (specially Midge!! I loved her). It's a very colorful movie and it's so refreshing to see that, specially with all the ""gray"" movies we get nowadays. The characters in Barbie land are fun and innocent, it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way it's filmed, the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child. Plus I really loved Ken and I think Ryan Gosling did a great job, he was hilarious. The Kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for me.<br><br>However this movie could have been an almost perfect movie if it wasn't for the real world parts and the messaging at the end of the movie.<br><br>First of all, the real world is extremely exaggerated and they were really pushing the political view they had in this part.<br><br>The scene where a man simply smacks Barbie out of nowhere is very unnecessary and it ruins the beautiful parts were Barbie is trying to feel and understand the real world around her like with the old lady at the bus stop (that part is just perfect and captures the essence of the real and beautiful complexity of real world feelings). More so, the parts with the mother and the teenage daughter could have been way better and I really didn't like them coming to the Barbie world. The ""deprogramming all the barbies"" was too forced for me and I would prefer if Barbie herself did that.<br><br>Which leads me to the final part, the politics.<br><br>After seeing the real world 'patriarchy"", Ken, a character that lived his whole life just to please Barbie and is nothing more than an accessory to her, finally feels appreciated for the first time in his life and brings the patriarchy to his own world because of that. Is he right? No, of course not. But I think it was actually a logical thing for him to do in that moment. And, for me, the movie was going to acknowledge that at the end. But it didn't. I mean, it did a little bit, but not enough in my opinion. It would have been awesome if the Barbies and kens came together at the end and decided to create a better society for both of them. But instead they chose to make a joke that ""the Kens will someday have just as much power as the women in the real world..."" It really missed the point of making Barbie land and lost the opportunity to make an inspiring example for the real world, one that helps the oppressed and makes equal opportunities for both men and women.<br><br>Anyway, this my review of the movie and in conclusion: Close Kenough to a perfect movie.",7
" spoiler free!
",OMG IT IS SO GOOD especially for young woman! It is so inspiring and really shows everything Barbie is. I think this movie is good for all ages because it will teach all woman how life really is and it will teach young girls the reailty of this world and how to prepare for obstacles that come there way. This movie was funny as well as informing and I didn't expect this plot at all from this movie. I would see this again becuase it is just that good and I think out would needs to turn to Barbie land because there world is fair and I wish we could be like that. It is so amazing so so so good 5/5.,10
" Strange but it has its positives
","Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you.",6
" A candy pop satire that hopefully changes the world a bit.
","I found it to be a surprising grand piece of comedic, satire story telling, again concerning questions of gender roles and toxic masculinity. By the end I was moved to tears for Barbie AND Ken. It represented to me many issues of modern times and things I was confronted with in real life. The candy pop world and performances added so much to it to support the story and as a set designer I found the Barbieworld of course mesmerizing, melancholic and so well done. I hope, apart from all the social media hype, it will do some good in the world, heals girls, women, boys and men... and all those men who got dragged by their girlfriends and found it a reminder we dont need the other gender to support our worth. It is and was the hardest lesson to learn.... for me.",8
" A fun movie with a tiny bit of complexity
","The film is an enchanting mixture of sitcom, satire on consumer society and philosophy, where they dragged in everything they possibly could: from Pinocchio to the Bible. At the same time, the movie seems like a sketch from a talkshow that parodies cliches associated with the Barbie subculture.<br><br>All the most important things happen towards the end, when Barbie faces a dilemma on a universal scale: to remain a doll in an ideal doll world or to become a real (""ordinary"") person. There is no single correct choice here. You either live in a delusional bliss or face the harsh reality.<br><br>In general, the impression of the film can be expressed in a phrase: they wanted to say a lot of things at once, but along the way they also got lost in their grandiose attempt at philosophy. Nevertheless, the film turned out to be funny. Adults will enjoy reading the philosophical ideas hidden here. And for children there is a bright, dynamic story and several smart ideas presented in understandable language.",6
" A plastic product.
","I thought the first half of the movie was hilarious and well done, but the last act of the movie is where it lost me. Instead of trying to communicate a message, it really felt like it was preaching way too much. Instead of showing, it tells you what to think in the last act of the movie.<br><br>The only thing it has going for it is the set desing, wardrobe and music.<br><br>Aside from tha the movie is plastic like the eponymous doll.<br><br>The characters have no plot development, literal cliches.<br><br>If you write characteres as abstractions , at least try to make into characters that are relatable to the viewer.<br><br>Do not waste your time with this movie.",1
" Couldn't love it more
","This movie is nothing like I expected AND I LOVE IT. Greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama. I laughed, I almost cried and it was just the best experience.<br><br>Having moments when I just loved seeing the interpretation of the Barbie world, moments that shocked me of how well they described the patriarchy even through jokes, the moments showing the women maturing and growing up that almost made me cry. There was nothing I didn't love about this movie and I can't stress this enough.<br><br>Overall, this movie made me fell more empowered and confident than ever and I wish that everyone could have the same experience that I did.",10
" Goood movie, bad plot
","While this movie is worth seeing and contains some humorous moments, as well as Ryan goslings 'I'm just Ken' being one of the highlights, I wasn't a fan of the men vs women portrayal, and the plot wasn't the best. For example, why did the Mattel board chase barbie into barbieland when what they wanted was for her to go back there and how did the Ken's brainwash intelligent barbies in such a short period of time. Also some of the references were a bit obscure and the end dragged on for at least 10 minutes too long. However it is worth noting that the costume and set design was astonishing and enhanced the experience of the movie.",7
" Definitely Not For Kids
","I've just taken 2 nieces, 9 and 14, to see Barbie. They both hated it... really, really hated it!! And, me: I'm just stunned. I've no idea what I've just seen.<br><br>If Barbie is meant to be a dark satire, it's alright. If it's meant to be a kids movie, it's unconscionably bad. And, I'm totally confused which type of movie it's supposed to be. What the literal heck is going on!!<br><br>If you're looking for a twenty first century dark cultural satire, you're at least in your twenties, you've an open mind, this is your movie... maybe. If you're looking for a movie to take your kids to, before getting ice cream, this is absolutely not the movie you're looking for. My advice: give Barbie a miss and go straight for the ice cream. You will be so much happier. I wish I had.",3
" Good Movie
","Rating: 8.1
Overall, a feminist powerhouse of a movie as Greta Gerwig exceeded my expectations to create a very fun movie to watch as it is filled with an enjoyable cast, funny jokes, and memorable production design, costumes, and soundtrack as the movie tells many different messages about self-image and societal power, even though it is very on-the-nose about it and does not tie up all the loose ends.<br><br>Good Direction (Although she does stick to her typical style of filmmaking, she uses a more palatable style of storytelling that incorporates meta humor that does not take itself too seriously to tell her messages; she builds both the Barbie World and the Real World very well; she gets a good amount from her actors (even though it is just so stupid at times what she has them do, an aspect that I kinda enjoyed, to be honest)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Margot Robbie (Uses more of her experience as an actor and celebrity to play the role as she polls from many aspects of her career to create a multi-dimensional version of a once very shallow character), Very Good from Ryan Gosling (The real comedic relief of the movie as he steals the show in all his scenes with how silly and stupid he is; he is also a big driver of morality throughout the movie as he shows how the oppressed feel once they gain some ounce of power), Good from America Ferrera (Does well in her scenes and acts as the moral compass throughout the movie (bridging the divide between the Barbies and the Kens)), Pretty Good from Kate McKinnon (Plays the typical role she is used to playing), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Cera (The role of Allan was specifically written for him and he did his best embodying it), Pretty Good from Ariana Greenblatt (Plays her role well and acts as the youthful voice in the movie), Pretty Good from Simu Liu, Pretty Good from Issa Rae, Pretty Good from Rhea Perlman, Pretty Good to Good from Will Ferrell (Uses his experience as it is as if the role was written for him), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Pretty simplistic overall as it follows a pretty standard template but it pays homage to many different movies and is laid out well; the ending was pretty predictable though (and kinda feels like they didn't close up some of the messages they were trying to present)), Good Screenplay (Dialogue flows well (even though it is a bit on the nose/meta); jokes were surprisingly funny and helped make swallowing the message easier; the symbols and messages of the movie are taught throughout the movie and done so in a very easy way to understand given how overt they were (which is good cause there are surprisingly many nuances to them despite the subject matter/how it is told); foreshadowing was somewhat there but not as good as it could have been), Pretty Good Score/Very Good Soundtrack (More of a soundtrack than a score-based movie), Good to Very Good Cinematography (Really enjoyed the shots they used in Barbieland as it helps give it a cartoony yet cheap feel), Good Sound, Very Good Editing (Really enjoyed the assembly line shots in Barbieland as it helped give it a simulation feel), Good Visual Effects, Great Production Design (Really what makes the movie as the sets were great to look at with its cheap feel and how pink they were (giving a very big doll-house vibe)), Very Good to Great Costumes (Really help give the Barbie feel of the movie as they fit the doll vibe and help bring color and flavor to the movie), Plot Structure was pretty simplistic overall as it follows a pretty standard template (similar to that of a coming-of-age/trying to save your village type of movie), Pacing was good as it was not too fast or slow (no need to cut or add any content), Climax was decently executed as it shows some resolution in the conflict (but it does not do that great of a job tying up all the loose ends as it feels kinda forced), Tone was very cartoony/Barbie as it did a really good job at establishing this throughout the movie; there were also many different flavors of Greta Gerwig's style that were mixed throughout this movie.",8
" Is it really the movie of the summer?
","I have many opinions when it comes to this movie. The movie itself was great, but as everything in life nothing is perfect.<br><br>Why a 7 out of 10? You may ask yourself, well even though the movie was great produced, had a great casting, great costumes and of course an impressive set, the plot was weak. The fact that Barbie (Margot Robbie) did not last even five minutes in the Real World disappointed me. I know that she was supposed to find Gloria (America Ferrera) to get ""fixed"", so she could go home and be the stereotypical barbie again, which in fact was the main plot of the movie, at first. However, she finds her real fast, not giving Barbie enough time to get to know the Real World, aside from the disrespectful male individuals in the beginning. I would have liked Barbie to experience the Real World in a different way, even though the Real World is messed up. I think it would have been nice for Barbie to eat an ice cream for the first time that was not made of plastic or simply for Ken to feel the water at the beach and realize it was not made of plastic or foam as well.<br><br>Another thing that I did not like was that some characters from Barbie Dreamhouse were not in the movie, such as Ryan, Raquelle, and Nikki, but it was better like that because we all know Raquelle and her unexplainable need to be more successful than barbie at everything. Although at some points I wonder what would have been like if Raquelle were in the movie and totally interfered with Barbie's plan of getting fixed in the Real World.<br><br>Let us talk about Ken (Ryan Gosling) for a minute. I must say that, at first, I found Ryan Gosling unfit for the Ken role, but I am completely happy with the way he portrayed his character. He made me laugh so much with his facial expressions and his speeches. I went to watch the movie for Barbie and ended up in love with Ken's character. However, Ken might have been funny, but when he totally invaded Barbie's house and threw her clothes away, I found it mean and disrespectful. Yet we have never thought about the Kens for a second, like where do they go when the Barbies go to sleep.<br><br>I feel like they took this movie as a huge Mattel propaganda, instead of what it should have been. A fun movie where Barbie ventures into an unknow world for the first time trying to get her ""problems"" fixed but having to bear with Ken throughout the whole trip; like those comedy movies where a duo must stick together through a difficult situation even though they do not entirely love each other's personality.<br><br>At last, I loved how Barbie did not need a man to be happy or complete and I also loved how Ken realized that he didn't need Barbie for him to be Kenough. Not like in Dreamhouse where Ken is always so clingy and needy of Barbie just because. Like Barbie don't need no man to be Barbie. I also loved Allan and his awkwardness, so sad that they discontinued him and Midge. I would have liked to see Ken and Allan as buddies, after all that's why Allan was created, to be Ken's buddy, although I don't think they would have clicked.<br><br>Margot did an amazing job as Barbie and so did Ryan as Ken. I love them both and loved their acting in this as well, I truly enjoyed the movie expect the little things mentioned previously.",7
" Barbie a Must See
","This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected. Mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off; kudos to the believers of this script. It is so worth seeing once, twice, three times and then some!",10
" Great potential but messy closure
","Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.<br><br>As for the remaining 20%, it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose.",6
" Hilarious and Thoughtful
","This is actually very close to a great movie. It deserves your time and money at the theatres. Remember Lego Movie? How no one was expecting anything from it, labelling it as a cash grab? And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful, clever comedy? This movie is just as good.<br><br>This is a fun, over the top, laugh out loud comedy that manages to communicate a very necessary message. I loved how much fun it had in doing that. It used comedy as a tool to prove its point. It's not easy guys. Making a satire itself is not easy, let alone turning Barbie into a good movie.<br><br>The over-the-top way this movie made fun of sexism was hilariously genius. It reminded me of ""Don't Look Up"". That was another movie that deliberately made its characters unrealistically unlikeable to prove its point using humour. There are dialogues in this movie where I was like, it's funny but yeah, it needed to be said. The way this movie constantly made jabs at where gender equality stands at the moment, was genius.<br><br>Everyone in this movie is having so much fun. The actors, all of them gave hilarious performances. Ryan Gosling, especially, was so funny. His character was so integral to the main theme of this movie.<br><br>This movie is so self aware, that I wouldn't have been surprised if a character just mentioned the opening weekend battle with Oppenheimer.<br><br>It has a few problems though. While the way the main theme of this movie is concluded was more or less perfect, I thought the way Barbie's character was concluded didn't make much sense and was sort of contradictory. And given that it's a very over the top comedy, some scenes do stretch a bit too much. It can get a bit too preachy at times too.<br><br>But honestly, I had a great time. I would highly recommend watching this in theatres. In fact, my entire hall was laughing throughout the movie.",8
" There is a substance to this movie.
","I read from many sources about Barbie being a hardcore feminist movie, just as bad as all recent Lucasfilm sludge. I'm happy to report it is not true.<br><br>Barbie and Ken have their separate, but equal story arcs. Ken goes on adventure of self discovery and ultimately learns his value outside just being there just for Barbie.<br><br>Barbie's part of the story lingers a lot on the paradox that she is meant to be an icon of emancipation, but is also blamed for setting the wrong standards and gets some hate for it.<br><br>There are also real human characters, which are compelling at first, but rather simplistic.<br><br>The storytelling frequently stops to explore and explain too many messages about society, equality, misogyny and troubles if growing up and being a woman or a mother.<br><br>The writing has some problems, bad jokes and the last twelve minutes are utterly pointless. But overall it delivered what it promised in a very nice package.<br><br>The sets and cinematography are top notch, as well as the acting.",6
" Enjoy the movie, feminists!
","Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I'm not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell ""the message"". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn't there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did.",4
" A film that truly lives up to the hype
","A Barbie movie helmed by Greta Gerwig starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling... what could possibly go wrong? Practically nothing it seems, as this movie is a complete knock out in every possible way.<br><br>It is hilarious from start to finish with a sharply funny, meta, intelligent script that is matched by the masterfully executed physical comedy.<br><br>The story is emotional and powerful and meaningful which I did not expect, but this proved to be such a vital and welcome part of the film.<br><br>The entire cast is brilliant with outrageously camp performances from them all, but the highlights are the two leads. I can't think of two better people suited for the roles than Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. They both give perfectly flawless performances, filled with heart and humour and charisma. Will Ferrell is a scene-stealer with some hilarious comedy as you'd expect, and America Ferrera delivers a great performance with a lot of heart.<br><br>The visuals are so fun from the sets through to the costumes. It is such a vibrant and colourful film that bursts with creativity, and to top it all off it has a superb soundtrack as well.<br><br>If you were once a Barbie movie sceptic like me, then think again as it does not disappoint!",9
" Great acting, great set, great meaning, but rushed storyline
","I loved the set design, acting and personal development of the characters, the nuance and meaning, but didn't like the rushed storyline. Production obviously invested a great deal in the set design, barbie dream houses, and wardrobes. It was pink everything with blue ""beach"", with a plastic vibe. It was cool how they incorporated the Barbie box and different outfits, something I loved as a child. I also thought TV Barbie was a blast from the past (90s baby here), and learned about other dolls like Midge, Skipper, and Alan. Also... they didn't do poor Midge any justice. She was played by a terrific actress, so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character. I thought Alan was played very well though.<br><br>I thought that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling played their characters perfectly, capturing their characters development and different nuances. You could definitely see Barbies transformation into a human, but Margot did a good job at keeping Barbie at her core even in human form.<br><br>Some of my favorite storylines included the war of the Kens, the discovery of patriarchy, the brainwashing of the Barbies, and the takeover of the Barbies - again.<br><br>However, the switch to the real world and back felt rushed, as well as the relationship development between Sasha and Gloria, and Barbie. Really what should have happened was a two part movie, to fully tell the story, or a 3 hour movie. I also felt they spent too much time in Barbie world in the beginning and felt myself getting bored.<br><br>For example, Sasha and Gloria meet Barbie and after one scene believe that she is a doll and follow her back to Barbie world. I felt like Barbie should have had to work to make them believe her, making the discovery of Barbie world by Sasha and Gloria even sweeter, and Barbie's transformation into human even more complex. I wish I got to see her learn more about becoming human. I absolutely loved the gynecologist scene at the end, but felt that could have been earlier in the movie, with the scene with Ruth at the end.<br><br>I couldn't discern if this movie was just a comedy or trying to be serious, with all the complex nuance surrounding feminism. It could have easily been both if there was more time spent on Barbie's transformation to human. Maybe a second movie could have been about her going back to Barbie world in human form to save her girls and restore the proper control to Barbie.",7
" The first half is great but the rest...
","I honestly cannot understand those rating on here. The first half ot the movie is exactly what I expected from a barbie movie; it's fun, it's pink and it was just a great watch but then (oh lord) the second half started. Although I understand that the producers try to address certain issues in society but this has absolutely no place in a Barbie movie. I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it. It leaves a bitter taste behind and destroys the good vibes from the beginning of the movie. I'm extremely disappointed.",3
" Really good . Like nothing I've seen before
","I thought all the jokes were really funny and I felt a bit sorry for Ken while all the barbies rule barbie world all ken (Ryan gosling) wants is to be noticed by barbie (Margot Robbie) and when he goes to the real world and discovers that it's all about men and horses and he freaks out . I also loved the fact that all the barbies were not all skinny and blonde . I also thought that it was really sweet the way barbie met Ruth and Ruth was kind off like a mother to her and she helped her along the way in the movie . Everything was pink I can see how there was a shortage of pink paint . And it was really funny when the narrator was giving her opinion throughout the movie . So to all the cast, directors , singers , producers and people involved well done . It was amazing. And it will give girls a lot off confidence for a long time .👏👏👏👏👏",10

" An Extremely Clever and Entertaining Experience
","Well, if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great, I guess a Barbie film can as well. I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing. Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though, and Barbie is just that. It's definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's a lot more than just bright colours so let's get into it.<br><br>To keep it simple, the film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) as she realizes there is more to life than just living in Barbieland. Accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), they venture to the real world. With many revelations about how awful our world is, the two of them discover what is both good and bad about life. I'm keeping it vague because what helps this simple story become a more complex one is the social commentary and incredibly funny humour. I was laughing hysterically throughout and I was genuinely moved by the end.<br><br>Certain viewers may find some of the messages to be heavy-handed, but I didn't. In fact, I found that the messages actually made the film better overall. Yes, it's a film that explores equal rights, but it does so in a fashion that doesn't downgrade anyone, but rather puts others on a higher pedestal. I really liked how the film handled all of the issues it presented. I shouldn't have been too surprised though, because Greta Gerwig as a director is just fabulous.<br><br>Having liked both Lady Bird and Little Women, Gerwig has continued to impress me as a director, even if I haven't exactly loved any of her films yet. Well, I believe her efforts here made the best film of her career to date. There are so many different variations of Ken and Barbie and the performances she pulls out of each and every one of these performers was nothing short of great. I mean, with that said, it didn't hurt that the cast was perfection.<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are terrific as always and are obviously the main reason to see this film on the surface, but America Ferrera and Simu Liu were also standouts to me. Each character either had a dramatic or comedic moment that stood out and I couldn't get enough of the whole cast. Michael Cera as Allen is gold as well, but in the end, this is a film that all came down to the screenplay. Yes, the set design is award-worthy, the musical number is worthy of an Oscar-nomination, but Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach crafted a genius script here. The nuances throughout are what sent this film over the edge for me. Their attention to detail was perfect here. I highly recommend Barbie to all ages and genders.",9
" Funny and watchable
","The social commentary was pretty heavy-handed. Albeit, this is to be expected in the Barbie movie. However, it was genuinely funny. A lot of creativity and imagination went into this movie which ads to the charm. There were tons of little details that could make this a movie great to own and watch more than once. Plot was a cute but could have been smarter. Its nice to see a new movie that isn't just a remake or a sequel but I fully expect to see a franchise for this. I appreciated the few times that they seemingly poked fun at feminism. In one the of the final scenes, the creator of barbie character said that the patriarchy was something that was made up to deal with how the world is.",7
" Deeply sad movie, filled with jokes, dolls and pink :(
","I didn't expect this! Saddest movie of all times told with Barbie dolls, jokes and a lot of pink!<br><br>Cleverest movie ever made. I see how they made this movie to lock up in the cinemas huge numbers of people of all ages and genders and to forcefully OPEN THE EYES of those who still have them closed 😢<br><br>EXTREMELY funny, beautiful, direct, but deeply sad movie 😢😢😢.<br><br>Haters who rate this movie low are the mysoginists that would HATE for people of both genders to ever smarten up!<br><br>People who say that the message was too direct, obviously don't know anything about art. You can't make a movie with BARBIE dolls and tell a SUBTLE message, you cannot, any artisticly inclined person knows this. I would have rated very low this movie if the message had been more subtle!!!!!!!",10
" Fun but disappointing
","Funny thing to say about a Barbie movie, means I had my hopes too up, but it's more about who directed it, I think she's pretty good.<br><br>What worked for me was the barbie world, and Margot and especially Ryan were great. Every scene with Ryan was great, he's got great comedic timing.<br><br>What didn't work was the real world. The real people are supposed to come and teach the dolls what real life is like, but they do it with the most cliche, cringiest dialogue (I would call it womansplaining honestly, stuff that will make everyone cringe in like 10 years - but hey, it's a Barbie movie in 2023, what can you expect).<br><br>The issue really is that the real people (the mother and daughter and the Mattel people and even people on the streets) were just not believable as real people. So if you're not going to show believable characters, you may as well just show me the dolls and remove the real world all together.<br><br>Overall pretty funny, worth a watch, but it has much less depth than I imagined from the trailers. In the end it's just a huge product placement, when it could've been more. But hey, just imagine how them profits will skyrocket.",6
" Profundity Sold Seperately
","It's a Barbie movie. It is as saccharine as Treacle and as empty as Barbie's head. A pink spectacle, and much like the doll, you can try to attach some accessories or throw on a doctor's coat or any array of add-ons you want. However, at the end of the day, it's a cheap children's toy, that any sane adult should ignore or only look upon as some bitter-sweet memento of a childhood that they will never regain.<br><br>Throughout the build-up to the release of this film, I was led to believe that behind the gloss there was a deeper meaning to it. Greta Gerwig is regarded as an auteur, and the script was said to be too good to pass up. In the end, the message was too shallow to be impactful, the story too 'meta' to be taken seriously, and the dialogue as stiff as the plastic that Barbie is cast from for it to be any good. At least we know who the Real Barbie is for, but when I left the theatre I had no idea who the film is for or what it was really trying to say. It's not exactly a kids' film. It's not an intelligent art house film. It's not a summer action-packed blockbuster, it's not an interesting take on modern-day feminism, nor does it provide any sort of interesting commentary on any social or political issue. It is just a boring pink distraction.",1
" Nothing short of brilliant - could be a game-changer
","Barbie is an anomaly, a force of nature, and could potentially be some sort of trendsetter in ways I can't quite fathom yet. I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist, especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire, ambition, and intellect. But, this movie isn't just good - it's fantastic.<br><br>Choosing to make ""facade"" one of the primary focuses of the film was probably the most brilliant thing that writer/director Greta Gerwig could have done, because it allows the movie to function as a wholly progressive and often quite meta experience. Though the movie only goes back and forth between Barbie Land and ""reality"", I felt as if I traversed through 5 or 6 different dimensions throughout the course of the film. The movie has so many layers, I'm not even sure how Gerwig made it work - maybe it was luck, maybe it was an incredibly talented cast &amp; crew, or maybe she's just a genius.<br><br>What's most important is that the movie is hilarious, all the way through. There weren't many segments where a giant smile was not plastered across my face. Though the choices for comedic roles could be perceived as cliche, all of them murdered the game with their characters, that being Michael Cera as Allan, Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie, and of course Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. But, it's Ryan Gosling that truly steals the show as the funniest part of the entire film. Of course, it's the brilliant writing that allows it, but Gosling's commitment to bringing to life one of the greatest exaggerations of masculinity I have ever seen put to screen is diamond-level. The way the movie spotlights parallels between straight-guy masculinity and gayness, as both a joke and an astute observation, is incredible and done in a way I've never seen pulled off before.<br><br>It should be said that what allows a comedy to transcend the bone-headed standards that the genre usually plants itself in, is a script that actually has something to say, from the heart and from the brain. I figured it would poke fun at certain gender tropes and politics, but I didn't expect Barbie to be full of so much existential philosophy. At times it almost felt like Charlie Kaufman LITE, but in a GOOD WAY. Though most of the film is full of laughs, it also has several segments that will suddenly take you to realms of sheer reflection and a surprising amount of emotional resonance. I think a lot of people had to get over an ""am I about to cry at a Barbie movie?"" hump, but...I want you to know that you should cry at this movie! It's both nostalgic and totally ahead of its time at the same time. It's actually a very serious and important film underneath all the pink &amp; the laughs.<br><br>And on that note, it's not surprising that so many dudes are already calling it a horrible movie and overly woke feminist propaganda, but it's definitely lame of them, and in my opinion, wrong. I think a lot of these people are missing a lot of the points and the jokes. Though on the surface the movie seems to be poking most fun at men, it pokes just as much fun at femininity, society, and the human experience as a whole. It has a lot of critical things to say about all of them. Plus, if you can't laugh at your own kind, especially when it's done so articulately, with so much love, I really think you're doing it all wrong.<br><br>It comes as no surprise that Margot Robbie carries the film wonderfully. The soundtrack is also a ton of fun. But the most exciting part here, ""as a fan of the cinema"", is knowing that this is going to take Greta Gerwig to the absolute top of the totem pole. She's been such an interesting, tasteful, and likable multi-faceted presence, between acting, writing, and directing, and I'm very curious and excited to see what she does with her power after this.",9
" Brilliant Message but over-hyped
","I went to go see it in the theaters and I wish I saved my money and just watched it at home.<br><br>The message was beautiful and there were a few brilliantly written emotional moments.<br><br>However I found the movie was rushed, there were a few plot lines that had some gaps and things moved too quickly.<br><br>Also I was expecting it to be more of a comedy, but the trailer shows all of the comedic bits. I feel like by the time I went to see the movie there were no surprises left.<br><br>Watch the movie for the message but don't go in with super high expectations like I did.<br><br>I believe that it's not worth it to watch in theatres. But would be a good movie to watch at home with a feel good message.",6
" So bad
","I really wasn't expecting much from this movie when I decided to watch it but I thought at least I would have some laughs right? That did not happen...<br><br>So incredibly boring and the songs are so cringe and bad. This is supposed to be a comedy? I haven't laughed once. I wanted to quit halfway but I thought once I started it I'll finish it. I don't even know how I managed to get to the end...<br><br>I don't understand the hype around this movie and the score it has here on IMDb is more laughable than this movie could ever be. It might be amusing for kids around 7-10 years old, but adults: stay away from this one.",1
" Beautifully done movie
","I have never felt move validated as a woman as when I watched this film. It is so beautiful and meaningful while also being witty and funny, this is what a movie is supposed to be. You are supposed to be on the verge of tears and the next minute laughing, it's an experience. Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink. So well done and definitely a conversation starter. I hope when mothers accidentally take their daughters to see this expecting something else they come out feeling good about being a woman.",10
" A magical journey with a confusing ending
","Barbie is a film that stands out in many aspects, from its comedic moments to its unique charm. The world it presents is filled with vibrant colors, whimsical settings, lively music, and a sense of fantasy and extravagance. Visually speaking, the film is truly unmatched. The actors delivered commendable performances, with special applause going to Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. However, I must admit that I personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film. They struck me as particularly funny.<br><br>Where the story loses points is in its confusing message. While the film clearly aims to promote gender equality, the way it delivers this message suggests a certain superiority of the female gender. Some of the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic within the narrative. It wasn't so much the fact that the pep talks were about women, but rather the way they were integrated into the story. I want to clarify that my criticisms are not driven by bigotry or sexism. As a woman myself, I appreciate the intention but felt it could have been handled more subtly.<br><br>I found it disappointing that many of the characters in the film, such as Alan and several of the Barbies/Kens, lacked relevance and development or were straight up stereotypes. Additionally, I would have liked to see more exploration of Barbie Land and its unique characteristics. On a positive note, the message about the transient nature of one's life in comparison to the enduring power of an idea was sweet and exciting.",6
" funny with social commentary
","Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives in Barbieland. Ken (Ryan Gosling) is always desperate for her attention. All the Ken and Barbie dolls live in a happy matriarchy unaware of the real world. Out of the blue, Barbie starts pondering death and her existence. Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) tells her that she has opened a portal to the real world and must fix whatever is her real world problem before she can return to her perfect self. She and stowaway Ken find the real world completely different than their expectations. Mattel CEO (Will Ferrell) insists on putting her back in the box. Mattel secretary Gloria (America Ferrera) had caused the problem by drawing new forms of Barbie.<br><br>First, I love the premise and I love the 2001 opening. The start is a lot funnier than I expected. Margot Robbie is great and Ryan Gosling is hilarious. It's a great start in Barbieland. The first moments in LA is a little too much. Quite frankly, Barbie and Ken would not stand out at Venice beach. The male leering is good enough. They don't need to do the stereotype abusive guys. The real world should be realistic. Barbie and Ken would be better fishes out of the water in a recognizable regular world. The more average the real world is, the better it is for the characters to showcase their outrageousness.<br><br>Mattel is fun and I like the ridiculous silliness. Will Ferrell is a good way to show their outrageous quality. The movie has a lot of social commentary and that aspect does threaten to overwhelm it. The last act has some wonky moments as the movie tries to wrap its arms around the heavier social discussions. I would like to keep that more contained and concentrate on the mother daughter relationships. It's Gloria and Sasha, but it's also Ruth and Barbara. That's a perfect way to end the movie. I do like the montage idea, but I didn't realize what it was doing initially. It would have been fine to do that for the closing credits. All in all, this is a funny engaging movie and it's able to deal with some of the tougher social material.",8
" Unexpected but so enjoyable
","This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.<br><br>But other than that this movie was enjoyable, maybe not one of my favourites and I might not watch it again, but seeing it in the cinema was such a great atmosphere and it was fun to see everyone dress up and have fun and laugh together! &lt;3.",7
" Sure, Life in Plastic is Fantastic but ONLY in Barbieland
","The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.<br><br>I'm a visual kind of cinema goer and I have the say that dance sequence (Dance the Night) and the scene where Barbie and Ken where traveling to the real world were AMAZING. Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.<br><br>Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart.",10
" Better than it looks
","This movie was worth going to the theater I thought it was a good idea and there ware some really good jokes haw ever there are a few holes in the story and I feel like Barbie's personality was very empty I know that that is kind of how it's supposed to be because Barbie is a dal but for me I need to have a memorable mane characters. A other thing I liked about the movie was the opening scene lats just say it MIGHT BE
Really FUNNY. There were a lot of scenes in this were the hole theater was lagging so loud l couldn't hear a thing. I also never played with barbies so I didn't get any of the references but yeah I think movie was decent.",6
" Senseless, Stupid and illogical
","What exactly is the movie about?<br><br>Senseless, Stupid and illogical. Even the kids would hate this movie.<br><br>There is no clear message. Only those people who played with barbie dolls as a child would like this movie. They must have felt nostalgic and must have liked this movie. I don't blame them.<br><br>There is no clear logic around what barbieland is and what the real world is. If the barbies are all manufactured dolls, how do humans enter the barbieland. How the hell dolls and humans travel around different worlds? Using rollerblades lol.<br><br>This is a complete pink mess. It is neither about feminism nor about patriarchy. Hence I can't comment exactly on what they have supported.",4
" A telling of modern day society through Barbie
","Who would have thought that a film about Barbie would be one of the most original, fresh film of recent years.<br><br>There are so many positives of Barbie. First of all, the cast is brilliant. They work very well and are perfect for their roles, specifically Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (Oscar worthy in my opinion). A special mention to Michael Cera though for being spot on with his character.<br><br>It's funny but also unexpectedly touching and really showcases the problems with modern day society in an inventive way.<br><br>There was also surprises that were good and suited the narrative.<br><br>Some criticisms are it's drags in certain scenes and it's definitely not for everyone but I guess that's cinema for you.<br><br>Barbie is worth the watch!<br><br>Edit: actually watched it for a second time and it's just a fun movie with really detailed set designs and cleverly thought out mannerisms.",9
" I was skeptical but was pleasantly proved wrong
","Opposite of my expectations, overall I thought this movie was entertaining and pretty funny. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as Ken and the Ken's as a whole were really funny and my favorite part about the movie. The set design was knocked out of the park, it was the perfect look of Barbie land and it really immersed you in it. Lastly I thought the little details in the movie were awesome, like as if somebody was playing with Barbie like when she floats down from her house, the shower water is imaginary, and the drink she has at breakfast is imaginary. I love little details like that and Gerwig killed it with those.<br><br>But just like everyone has been talking about, I'd like to talk about the ""message"" this movie is pushing. I overall didn't feel like they were straight ""man hating"", but there definitely were certain parts where you just roll your eyes but it didn't take away from the overall experience for me. The part where they go to the real world and every dude they encounter is a cat calling misogynistic a-hole was a bit much for me, I am obviously aware it happens in the real world but they exaggerated it quite a bit. Imagine you take your young daughter to see this, it's gonna make her think every dude she encounters going forward is an a hole growing up.<br><br>The Characters of America Ferrera's daughter and the Mattel higher up's were absolutely worthless to the plot. I mean she is introduced to us by honestly being a b**** to Barbie spewing adult themed nonsense and then after that really has no growth and just is along for the ""diversion/twist"" that her mom is the one that needed Barbie's help.<br><br>My main gripe with this movie is the plot of the last 30 minutes and the ending. Ken comes back from Earth with ""Patriarchal"" ideals and takes over Barbie land and I honestly couldn't tell if they were supposed to be the so on ""villains"" of the movie or if just it was a joking way to have a problem in the movie. Because I never really felt like they were bad guys, Ken was treated like crap by Barbie and so it makes it really hard to ever root against him. The end was just real clunky and stuff just happened so fast and got too serious too fast. It's like they did it just they could get a way to fit in that montage video to pull women's emotional strings.<br><br>PSA: This is not a kids movie, definitely intended for young adults to middle aged women. Most of the humor in it is adult level humor.<br><br>But overall I came into this movie thinking I would dread it but came out happy with my experience watching it.",7
" overrated
",I think the idea is great and all but honestly for a movie about feminism the most enjoyable parts were the ken parts and its nothing we've never seen/heard before you know. Like the whole speech part ive heard all that a million trillion times. I struggled so hard to get through the movie the plot was hard to follow and the 'barbieland' doesnt really make sense. I also thought some stuff was just ridiculous like how they travel to the 'real world'. And im saying this as a woman and all but i think they could of done such a better job with a feminst movie honestly. Idk how people were crying im sorry JSHDS.,3
" This movie changed my entire life
","I swear to god this movie is one of the best i've seen this year. My expectations were high BUT NOT THAT HIGH. I'm not sure if this movie is good for small kids, they may not understand the problems this film addresses. I'm really happy that this movie was created because we should talk more about this problem (I don't wanna say what is this problem coz it would be a spoiler and i want you guys to have a surprise). And seeing Ryan Gosling in this role is something i would never expect to see. We know Ryan from all those mysterious and dark action films so seeing him dancing in colorful clothes and doing all these crazy stuff is incredible. I love this man and I love him even more now, i'm so grateful that he took part in such a great project that addresses such a huge problems. If you're still wondering if you should go or not the answer is YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO.",10
" Sublime
","I'm only writing this due to the misperception of this movie. I saw the movie opening night with my GF who loved and still loves Barbie. She is stereotypical Barbie and she dressed up in pink and had a wonderful time. If you're a fan of Barbie you can stop reading here and just go see the movie you will love it.<br><br>In fact if you are a fan of Barbie I suggest you stop reading this review and allow yourself to enjoy the fantasy and childhood nostalgia the movie will surely provide and avoid discussing the movie with anyone who wants to dissect it or take away from your feel good experience.<br><br>However, for the people who are championing the movie as a feminist masterpiece or hating on it for its depiction of men, I would like to ask if you watched the same movie? Neither men nor women were the target in this movie. This movie was taking shots at beautiful and desirable people in general. It is established quite early on that the Barbie's and Kens live in a dreamland and falsely believe they have solved the worlds problems and live in blissful ignorance. As soon as this main charachters bliss is threatened, that becomes the problem that the movie focuses on needing to be solved. Even though many real world problems are addressed and pointed out (usually by people not good looking enough to live in barbieland), they are all ignored and left unresolved by the end of the movie, that is, aside from the inclusion of ""ordinary people"" by Mattels introduction of ""Ordinary Barbie"", which seems to serve as further evidence of Mattel claiming self awareness (hammered home by constant self deprecation while never actually crossing the line into actually being the antagonist of the film) and wanting to distance itself from their objectification of women by making Barbie in the first place. Finally Barbie did not get any character growth by becoming real, Mattel just placed her in a box and got her off the production line through manipulative means employed by the founder of Mattel - an old woman. (honestly ladies, this is your real enemy in life lol. Men are pretty useless as depicted, old women who hate you for being young and shitty men who cant have you are the ones who oppress you)<br><br>The movie however seemed to say these things through mockery:
1- if you treat men like the Barbies treat the Kens, you will become one option of many, as made clear by being labelled low commitment casual girlfriends.<br><br>2 - When your old (like Barbie) you have to leave barbyland and you will be immediately devalued by having to relinquish access to your vagina. HOWEVER even though Ken is old (and unbelievably dumb and useless) he still gets to live in Barby Dreamland and maintains access to all the young beautiful Barby's which just seems to reinforce the supposedly ""patriarchal"" concept of men maintaining value as partners far longer then women.<br><br>3 - If you're young and pretty (for women) or just pretty (for men), you dont have any real problems and get to focus solely on easing any perceived blows to your extremely fragile emotional state while all the ugly people in the real world maintain order and functionality while dealing with ""real problems"".<br><br>4 - There in fact is a special existence for people who are good looking enough to qualify and even though its not based in reality, as long as your good enough, you get to live in the perfect dreamland while ugly people live in reality.<br><br>That being said, the movie is done very well and fun to watch and the casting is done well with all criticisms of the cast being too old, being proven wrong as their age was the actual focal point of the movie. Aside from America Ferrara. We do not like her as an audience lol. Superstore proved this. Her patronizing speech is an insult to women's intellects and the low point of the movie. Gosling's accidently but surprisingly meta self portrayal is probably the highlight. (I dont understand why men are upset by this, how Gosling was portrayed in this movie is exactly how I have seen him my entire life lol..).<br><br>I'd rate Barby as Sublime.",7
" Changed me

It'll make Barbie playtime more special and fun. It'll be a staple in my home and something that grows with me and my girls. It was funny, emotional, energetic and wholesome. Every time Barbie cried, I cried. Every time she laughed , I laughed. Growing up Barbie was my go to toy , it brought me comfort and fun. And as I had my girls it brings me joy to stand in the Barbie aisle as they pick out their favorite Barbie. Thank you so much for this movie. 💕",10
" Much Deeper Than I Thought
","Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline. Cast was star-studded and everything seemed to be in place, nothing off there. However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt.",7
" Surprisingly memorable
","I entered the cinema with high expectations, and they were massively outdone. The movie unfolds in a humorous manner, as lovable characters evolve in the most beautiful way they could. Margot Robbie is truly outstanding, and as a spectator I fully lived the experience thanks to her incontestable talent. As the experiences slowly unwrap, the issues and feelings that are contoured cut deeper and deeper, and the audience gets to experience these emotions in a sincere, beautiful way.<br><br>The movie is about the simplicity and complexity of life, about humans and their emotions, about what we do and why we do it, and about how they all meet in a fulfilling and imperfectly beautiful point.",10
" Bizarrely entertaining
","This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that. It's a lot though. Just a lot going on, and not all of what was going on was necessary.<br><br>Also, Ryan Gosling is not the best singer or dancer. It was cheesy and over the top. I'm glad I saw it in theaters because if it was on a streaming service I'd probably turn it off as it was so weird. It's worth watching so you're in on the hype and pop culture reference this will surely become.",6

As a gay man i love a bit of camp and irony and adore stories like Toy Story and Shrek and one of my favourite films ever is Baz Lurman's Moulin Rouge but this was just vacuous and appalling scripted and mediocre at best .<br><br>It wasn't oily and savage enough for a Brit like me who grew up on Monty Python and ridiculous comedy or satire enough , satire has to be dead pan to make it credible whereas this pile of poo meandered around endlessly looking for a joke and misfiring on many occasions . As a gay man i did like Ken's cowboy hat and could appreciate the ludicrous nature of the urban cowboy and had that one laugh at that moment but the rest i endured . I rarely walk out of a movie but really had to try hard to stay to the bitter end .",2
" Exceeded expectations
","I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings.",10
" Fun! (not necessarily a compliment)
","Barbie is Gerwig-Lite: just far too self-aware for its own good, to the point where it feels like it was written explicitly to impress critics. Gerwig and Baumbach parrot out every single intersectional feminist talking point in the book in an effort to communicate to the audience, ""Hey, we're aware of the philosophical complexities of this issue but we're still having fun!"" Which, fine, but Gerwig has already probed the question of what it means to be a woman much more meaningfully in her previous films without the kind of extratextual baggage this resorts to; political astuteness doesn't make for very entertaining or memorable film dialogue.<br><br>Also, I long for the (often hinted-at) version of this movie that critiques the toxicity and shortcomings of corporate feminism instead of basically endorsing it wholeheartedly (although I guess the ending sort of posits it as ""not for everyone"" but again, you see my point as to how overwritten this is). The production design and costumes are colorful and intricate but feel too safe, the soundtrack is rife with bland focus-group pop, and the whole thing has that weird plasticky look and feel to it that all Hollywood movies post-COVID seem to have. (I suppose ""plastic"" is appropriate for a movie about America's favorite doll, but I watched some of The Thin Red Line after getting home from the theater and felt myself ache for a time when humans were able to make beautiful-looking movies). It's indeed as fun and cute and peppy as everyone's said it is, but it could have been so much more.<br><br>Major points deducted for uncalled-for digs at Pavement and The Godfather (plenty of women love both!!)",6
" A Missed Opportunity for Empowerment and Inclusivity
","""Barbie,"" the new movie with a mission to encourage and empower women while challenging the notion of Barbie's objectification, falls short of its ambitious goals due to its overwhelmingly negative portrayal of men and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. While the film's attempt to address social issues and promote self-confidence among girls is commendable, its approach feels one-sided and counterproductive.<br><br>On the positive side, ""Barbie"" does boast an impressive musical score that complements the storyline effectively. The movie's soundtrack adds a touch of vibrancy and energy, helping to alleviate some of the weight of its problematic themes. Bilie Eilish's song, ""What was i made for"" sang by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling performance in ""I'm just Ken"" are the standouts.<br><br>Unfortunately, the film takes a heavy-handed approach in addressing gender issues. Instead of promoting a message of unity and understanding, ""Barbie"" seems to place the blame for all the problems in the world solely on men and the patriarchy. Such a narrative fosters a divisive atmosphere and fails to acknowledge the importance of cooperation between genders to achieve true progress.<br><br>The portrayal of men in the movie is disappointing and paints them with an unfairly broad brush. By portraying all male characters as either stupid, childish, immature, or disrespectful towards women, the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes, alienating a significant portion of its potential audience, including male viewers and responsible male role models.<br><br>Additionally, the excessive focus on harassment, groping, and dirty looks that Barbie experiences when she enters the real world feels gratuitous and does not contribute constructively to the movie's message. Instead of presenting a nuanced and realistic exploration of gender dynamics, it leans heavily on extreme examples, potentially distancing audiences from the central themes the film is attempting to address.",4
" So unexpected and so good.
","I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away. Under the guise of Barbie's beautiful dreamworld, the movie touches on some very real themes. With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time. I highly recommend for everyone to watch!",10
" The real crime is the requirement of a full-time dual income household
","It has great moments. The beginning might be the strongest I've ever seen. Unique. The soundtrack has a few songs that fall flat but overall it was very strong. Cinematography was unreal. Calling the old woman beautiful was rare and cool. The writing does seem to break down eventually though like really dropping the ball articulating the themes at times. Its not ""dark, weird, and crazy"" to have thoughts about death. That was just a strange choice. Margot Robbie had the best performance by far.<br><br>I really think the movie aims for a message of equality so its kinda contradictory that the resolution in barbieland is a woman-run government. I get what they're doing. I get its not a real place. But then why make a joke about letting the men have a few seats in the lower courts, when four women sit on the supreme court today. Joke about them just not being able to be president or something if you want it to hit home.<br><br>I think when people call this movie ""preachy"" theyre mostly talking about America Ferrera's speech. A lot of the points are valid but idk about:<br><br>""And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing
everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.""<br><br>""never fall down, never fail, never show fear""<br><br>Maybe in finance bro world? I still think the movie is well-intentioned. You should and they do preach equality.<br><br>I think legally blonde handled the same message better. You see people not taking her seriously throughout. It felt more developed like yes all these things are disadvantages that should change but you're already overcoming them while not shedding any femininity you may enjoy.",7
" A Remarkably Entertaining Piece
","This movie was a pleseant surprise. It managed to strike an excellent balance between adult and child themes, and essentially all of the humor lands well.<br><br>Towards the end it gets a little preachy with a certain character's speech, which takes away from the movie a bit. The speech itself just felt odd and was a bit on the nose compared to the rest of the movie, but they managed to tie it all up at the end of the movie fairly nicely so I am willing to overlook that. I really enjoyed the overall approach they took to the Barbie Movie and it had many little humorous surprises.<br><br>I'd highly reccomend the movie. It was a fun time and even now the theatres are still packed!",8
" Funny, but wish things played out different
","The movie started out fun and strong. I agree with some of the other reviews on here that the cast was excellent, set design superb, etc. However, the plot needed more clarity and to choose a better direction.<br><br>What I liked: It emphasized how with Barbie/dolls girls get to imagine themselves becoming all the things they can imagine and in their worlds they can control everything. Unfortunately, in the real world, patriarchy exists and we're limited. I liked it didn't marry Barbie off to Ken or make her have to have a relationship to be happy.<br><br>What I didn't like: The stereotypical treatment of men and the relegation of them back to second class citizens in Barbie land. That things got confusing and hard to follow. Why exactly were all Barbies instantly brainwashed but stereotypical Barbie?<br><br>I wish they could have handled the gender issues in a way to enforce more equality between the Kens and the Barbies without necessarily marrying them all of in pairs. Maybe Ken finally does get his mojo dojo saloon just not by taking over Barbies dream house. He gets acknowledged and gets his space too. Maybe he hooks up with Midge because he moves on. Maybe he gets a beach house so he can Beach off whenever he wants. I don't know. It was funny. I laughed out loud several times. Glad I saw it. Just wish they went some different directions.",7
" Barbie was much more than expected
","Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.",10
" Coming away a bit disappointed :/
","I was super excited to see this movie but I'm coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed. The marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what I expect and so my expectations were very high. There were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message. I think this film is a little late, maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesn't add much value to the feminist cause. It's worth seeing as it's definitely of cultural interest, but I won't be rewatching it.",6
" Failed to be funny, failed to be exciting
","It was one of the worst movies I've seen. I just tolerated it because I was with my family otherwise would leave the theater. Jokes were not funny. The message were poorly articulated. Nothing exciting except the decorations. It significantly lacks depth and can perpetuate certain stereotypes or unrealistic beauty standards. However, opinions on the movies vary, and some viewers enjoy them for their entertainment value and positive messages. It ultimately depends on personal preferences and perspectives. To me it was not funny, nor entertaining. It is a waste of time. No wonder many watchers left.",1
" A HONEST REVIEW
",People who followed all the lawsuits and all the Barbies throughout the years. It broke every single Hollywood Law in the books. Mattel made Satire out of their own overprotection of the Barbie Product. Margot Robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in Barbie. This is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely HATE Barbie. It is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movie.<br><br>Know your Barbie History before coming to the movie. Know the lawsuits which Mattel brought to those who used Barbie as Satire. 64 years of history in.one hour and fifty-four minutes.,10
" Unfortunately, the capital B applies only to the title; otherwise it is just a C.
","A difficult film to place. While it succeeds in entertaining and snatching a few healthy laughs-with quotes and jokes aimed mostly at an adept audience-it fails in my humble opinion in its underlying intention to convey a moral. The takeaways of the various Barbies, the monologues of the protoganist and her co-star are, in some ways, not only as anachronistic as they are predictable but all in all incomplete in their conclusions.<br><br>The film flows on the predictable register of a tale that is at once banal and surreal, only to head toward an ultra predictable end without ever, at any time coming across any scene or joke that really captures the viewer's attention.<br><br>I am not going to go into the various thorny topics addressed by the film because I think they were dealt with superficially while, if there is anything really good to point out, it was certainly the ability to confirm the importance of a serious publicity battage and how decisive the latter is in making all in all mediocre or slightly above sufficiency products achieve results that I sincerely do not think they deserve.",7
" Barbie took herself too seriously
","I'm a childfree woman that works in tech (male dominated environments), and I did not like this movie.<br><br>The first third of the movie was awesome! I loved seeing girls destroying their baby dolls and replacing with Barbie. As a childfree woman I was so excited!<br><br>The movie could have spent time exploring Barbie Dreamland, or time showing Barbie and Ken reacting to stuff in the real world... instead they:<br><br>1) Delivered rants about ""the patriarchy"", the movie was preachy and for what? Anyone at the Barbie movie is already open minded enough to go see this movie<br><br>2) Made it about ""men vs women"" rather than equality. A lot of issues women face due to social expectations affect men too, and feminism isn't about a matriarchy it's about equality<br><br>3) It wanted to deliver social commentary while being lazy. Even Ken says ""I thought the patriarchy was about horses"" If a movie wants to address social issues using terms as buzz words isn't enough. They could have explored how the patriarchy affects both genders, but this movie imo just wanted to virtue signal<br><br>4) They got a diverse cast, yet only the white actors had depth<br><br>5) At the end of the movie Barbie has visions of moms and daughters as the reason it's worth being human. A complete opposite message to the girls destroying their baby dolls at the beginning of the movie<br><br>I went into Barbie hoping for a ridiculous movie, not a movie about ""how tough it is to be a woman""<br><br>10/10 to the marketing team, though. They made me think this movie would be fun.",4
" Perfection
","Wow is all I can say. So many layers that had my daughter and I smiling, laughing, and sobbing all at the same time. Absolute perfection. So brilliantly written. Everyone should see this movie. It was amazing!!! Aspects for generations of women to submerge themselves in and was also full of a beautiful nostalgia for all the little girls inside of us, and those still growing up. I can not say enough good things about this movie. Though some may not enjoy the truths behind what this movie stands for it was a true testament to our current state of the world and what weve had to deal with for forever. Again just absolutely brilliant.",10
" Tried to go after many other great awakening films but with feminism-coated perspectives
","It's a fine, fun movie but will never be a classic one like 2001- or Matrix that makes you want to watch it repeatedly IMO. But definitely not a bad one.<br><br>I'd like to share my perspective on the end part that seems leaving some ppl confused. Even after showing all the difficulties, obstacles, and overcome between the two sexes, the only thing that matters is that we can procreate as humans otherwise all the messages, homages, jokes, history, and thoughts shared in the film will become meaningless without human existence. I don't know much about the director but even if she is a truly thoughtful feminist or not, the challenge of sublimating all the human themes to the simplest message at the ending scene should be evaluated properly.<br><br>As it went a bit dull and cliche-like throughout the film, It really looked like Barbie(Barbara) was going to have a job interview or something in that scene so was a nice unexpected ending blow to me. Yes, she seemed happy being pregnant(at least she didn't look like she had an STD to me) and it concludes the story neatly.",7
" Oddly fantastic!
","The script is well-written with engaging complexity, a remarkable script that transformed into an excellent film. All of the castings are top tier, I can't imagine another Barbie other than Margot. The sounds and visuals are admittedly not too prominent, but it also contributes significantly to the emotional orientation, which was done nicely. However, the film could have done better in developing the supporting characters. It's truly amazing that a film like this could do so well at the box office compared to other billion-dollar movies. And I think I'm not the only one hoping that there won't be a sequel, it's much better standing alone.",9

This is an attack on men and rightfully so. Barbie doesn't stretch the truth or make a mockery, she puts life on the screen exactly how it is. Barbie is a mirror.<br><br>And once again to the men who feel like ""this isn't for me"". If you are a heterosexual male attracted to women, the logical conclusion is to celebrate and enjoy femininity, to express curiosity, care and interest for women.

" A fair review
","My wife dragged me to see this, after I took her to see Indiana Jones. I'm not going to jump on this band wagon, this was a silly movie. I know what you are thinking ""typical male"", but no, I was willing to see this and put a high rating, if necessary.<br><br>The story is silly, and Will Ferrell really has to find a different movie scout. He's been in some horrendous movies of late. He's such a funny actor, but in this movie, it just didn't suit him and he wasn't funny in it. He tries too hard in this, and not his humourous self.<br><br>So, why not one star? Why four stars you say?<br><br>First up, America Ferrara, who plays Gloria in this movie, does deserve a credit for her good acting. She's a great actress, especially in the role she plays here. One star for her.<br><br>Secondly, there were a few laugh out loud moments in the movie. Not gonna lie, I did laugh in some scenes. Up to two stars.<br><br>Thirdly, I could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this movie, and there were a lot of chorography in the dancing that would have taking a lot of time to practice. Up to three stars.<br><br>Lastly, a few cameo appearances of A class actors popped up and it was funny to see. The last star given.<br><br>It's not a 1 star, it's watchable, but still very silly.<br><br>For me, I've watched it, but I wouldn't rush out to watch it again, or watch it when it comes on digital platforms later in the year.

And look around you, how many people came wearing pink? Don't underestimate the pink pound!<br><br>Coincidence that this came out with Oppenheimer? A juxtaposed way of telling a story, this film shows everything that's wrong with rom coms and drama and all genres. If you're a writer, producer, director, sit up and take note.",10
" It's not what I expected but in a good way
","The movie in my opinion is great, it's no Godfather but it's a movie about BARBIE it's supposed to be fun, easy going and delightful but also amazingly brings up the problems of todays women and MEN. It has a great portrayal of the difference between the barbie world and the real human world. The characters are weirdly relatable and understandable. Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of :
1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl 😂
2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch
3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world
4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one 😏
5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.<br><br>6. Great props makes you feel like they're actually in a plastic house.",10
" So Well-Done!
","Hilarious, fun, poignant, smart, and satirical. As a middle-aged mother of 4, I related to Gloria SO MUCH. And I cried. Boy did I cry. Much like Everyone Everywhere All At Once, I felt SEEN. For all the critics of the movie, my response is, 1. (Quoting Jack Nicholson) YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH, and 2. ITS SATIRE, FOLKS! But like most satire, it flies over the heads of many. Many stereotypes are addressed in an obvious way, but others are subtle. Not going because you don't want to support what you've heard is a political ""side"", well, that's just ridiculous. Give yourself more credit than that.",10
" Fun for some and Kenough for others
","This film has certainly grabbed the headlines and produced some very positive reviews which encouraged us to see for ourselves. We were a little disapointed in the end. Whilst it was watchable and had it's humerous moments, we somehow expected more from it. It's very much in the mould of a Hollywood film with lots of obvious cliches. There were quite a few teenage girls in the cinema with their mothers, which could be the ones who enjoy this film the most. It's been described as a 'fun' film by many, which I can understand. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their parts well and add to the charm of the film. I would hesitate to recommend this, other than to youngsters or 'young at hearts' who love Barbie dolls and want see a fun film with lots of pink sparkle.",5

However, I should have listened to my friends who were not telling me good things. The movie suffers from mixed messaging, it is dull in places, very unfunny and is over long. It's not quite sure who its audience is meant to be, after all it appears to be appealing in places to children, but 97% of this film, they wouldn't get. If you're a person like me who has a visual impairment, it's not even completely accessible. In short, if you haven't seen it yet, don't.",1

The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie.

","The Barbie movie is an okay movie for kids and adults alike. The first half of the movie is somewhat engaging and entertaining. However, the later half of the movie after Barbieland is not as good as the first half. The story becomes less interesting and the characters are not as well developed. The cinematography is still great but the plot becomes predictable and less engaging. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Barbie and wants to see a fun and entertaining movie. If you are looking for a movie with a great story and characters, then you might be disappointed with the later half of the movie.",4

I believe it would be a lot beter if it had only focused on one theme.<br><br>Other than that it was an insanely self-aware, bizarre, iconic, relatable and suprisingly deep movie.

Otherwise, I felt pretty left outside of it as if in some kind of populist political meeting where all the ideas of the moment are expressed. Ok why not, but I came for a story with emotions... and some catharsis. Here I felt there were 4 attempts of making us have a catharsis... but none really worked for me. A cerebral mumble jumble.",4

" Acting is Perfect
","If you're making brand films, each of his directors reveals his own vision, and that vision generally lacks some points. However, I think Greta Gerwig knew all aspects of Barbie so well that she reflected it on the screen perfectly. Margot Robbie also played the part very well apart from a few small scenes. In fact, when Barbie is mentioned, the role is well-accepted. Of course, Barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie. By writing Ken as a one-dimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story, he significantly increased the directors of the movie games. Ryan Gosling had a great acting. Frankly, he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen. For the other Barbie and Ken players, the states didn't show much of a performance (Maybe Kate McKinnon). There were no such important scenes anyway. But America Ferrera didn't do a great job despite having a very available house. I wouldn't say that I played badly, but there are a lot of actors who give better use of that role in my opinion.",10

Truly funny comedy &amp; sharp social commentary.<br><br>It touched on so many important themes surrounding gender, our patriarchal society and capitalism.<br><br>It is definitely a feminist movie for women who grew up playing with the dolls.<br><br>One of the best things I've seen in a long while.<br><br>The set design and costumes were totally brilliant.<br><br>Go see it!

" Writers were lost with this one
","If you want to educate yourself on patriarchy, read Virginia Woolf. The creation or viewing of this movie are horrible ways to raise your awareness about women's rights. It feels like writers were out of ideas an hour into the movie. The movie tries to have some sense of humor but hurts the main idea more than defending it while trying to make jokes about stereotypes of today.<br><br>The movie features musical type scenes but both the songs and dancing is horrible. People discuss if barbie products inspire girls or force a certain body type to them, so disappointing them but no worries, this movie can inspire nor deceive no one. Even the director lost inspiration half way through.",4
" Fabulously done
","So, I didn't have that much of a high expectation going in to see this because I really wasn't sure what is was going to be. I grew up playing Barbie's and have watched the animated films many times with my kids.<br><br>The movie from start to finish is so thoughtfully executed. It's for everyone, but mainly young girls need to see this. It's a great reminder of how special we are as women and how special ALL of us are individually as a person and the life we get to experience.<br><br>Another fantastic element is adding a very 90s feel to the film. You will laugh like you used to laugh when fun comedies would come out in theatre's years ago. I haven't seen just a good comedy with heart in years.<br><br>I brought my 7yr old and we dressed up for it too. I wanted her to see me comfortable in my own skin and her as well and the film touches on that. It's suited for any age, regardless of the rating.<br><br>I don't give high ratings like this to films usually, as I find small things usually that I wish had been addressed more... but not in Barbie. What a fun movie and a great time you'll have watching this in theatre (or at home) knowing it's your childhood come to life.",10
" Half-baked script with an impressive budget
","This movie LOOKED amazing. The costumes, sets, editing, and choreography were all high-budget and high-quality. That's probably why the poor writing stuck out like a sore thumb.<br><br>The characters are one-dimensional, the plot was not developed, the themes are poorly executed, and the ending had almost no connection to the rest of the movie. Other people have mentioned the movie's preachiness; instead of developing the message over the course of the movie, the mother character gives multiple speeches to let the audience know exactly what we're supposed to think. What happened to ""show, don't tell""?<br><br>Robbie and Gosling did what they could with the script that they had, making the movie enjoyable enough. The rest of the ensemble had no standouts, and the other Barbies were frustratingly identical in their one-dimensional performances.<br><br>Speaking of Gosling, did anyone else feel like Ken had more character depth than Barbie? In the BARBIE movie? Don't get me wrong, I loved his performance, but it definitely felt like he upstaged Robbie's Barbie for a large part of the movie.<br><br>Overall, it was enjoyable, but I wouldn't waste money on a theater ticket. Watch it when it comes out on streaming and form your own opinion.",5
" Entertaining
","I had good expectations from this movie but I decided to watch Oppenheimer in theatres instead of this. As the movie has hit digital, I watched it.<br><br>I enjoyed the movie; it had drama, comedy, music and most importantly entertainment value. The story was good and nicely executed, the screenplay was good, the direction was good but the performances were above average rather than being good. The pacing had some issues but that can be neglected as you will be enjoying the movie from the start till the very end.<br><br>Overall, you should give this movie a try. For me, it doesn't have any repeat value but it's it deserves a shot.",8
" Hey Twitter, lets go party!
","Sorry for the title, militants, please don't cancel me! (seriously, jokes aside)
While the movie is good, I anticipate a lot of memes about overblown cancellations, prejudice, and patriarchy... which I think get a lot of attention from the script. More than was needed.<br><br>The movie is fun and has great performances, hats off to Margot Robbie, but, Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu's Kens stole every scene. The rest of the acting and cast is just fine, I don't believe I've seen a single bad performance.<br><br>For a particularly comedy film, I feel like my session lacked laughs. Throughout the film, I laugh in very few scenes, but I also understand that they are directed at children and so on. (ignoring the last part, there are some jokes with double meanings, nothing that children would understand, watch it calmly with the little ones!)<br><br>...but I have to admit, the movie didn't get me. Actually, it was one of the few times that I almost fell asleep in the cinema. This time, me and my company, we yawned so much that we started to cry from sleep, but we didn't pass out. The reason i'm writing this last part is because i can understand the 1/10 and the 10/10 reviews... it just hits people in different ways. The only bad thing this movie did is make me sick of the color pink. Seriously, the theater was packed with people wearing only pink.

Here is my review written as a prententious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:<br><br>In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unraveling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.<br><br>With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.<br><br>Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.<br><br>Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?<br><br>Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.<br><br>In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",10
" Barbie' Dissected: Between Empowerment and Convention
","Describing this film is quite a challenge, as it falls into a peculiar realm for all the wrong reasons.<br><br>Let's begin with its positive aspects. The cinematography truly stands out; every scene is aesthetically pleasing and meticulously designed. The consistent use of pastel colors throughout the entire film is nothing short of impressive.<br><br>However, when it comes to the storyline, there's nothing particularly groundbreaking. The underlying message of empowering women and bridging the gap between genders while ridiculing patriarchy is commendable. Yet, ""Barbie"" lacks ingenuity; much of the plot feels familiar from other films, with some of them executing the concept more effectively, like the movie ""Men.""<br><br>Acting-wise, the film struggles. There's only one scene that truly shines, featuring America Ferrera delivering a captivating monologue towards the film's conclusion. Beyond that, the remainder of the cast's performances are fairly average, despite some members having made better career choices prior to this project.<br><br>All in all, ""Barbie"" seems to have been given more hype than it deserves. It falls within the realm of a feel-good movie and not much beyond that. Approach it with minimal expectations, and you might find some enjoyment in the experience.",5
" Man's world isn't just about woman
","For some not so fun to see it the other way around.<br><br>The expectations that challenge women on every step are impossible to empathise with. But are well said in ""breakout spell"", that woman isn't allowed to make mistakes, yet she is responsible for all the mistakes. And the problems that Barbie experiences the second day are part of life and we know that world isn't perfect and we all deal with it in our own way whether in flats or heels. And same goes for Kens, there is no need for stereotypes, just be Kenough.<br><br>Living in 21st century is challenging for all, but let's take everybody's heads out of their a*ses and enjoy this ridiculousness that is happening all around shown on screen.<br><br>The most spectacular part of it all is the art direction and attention to detail that brought so many easter eggs.",9
" Overrated, Overlong and Obvious
","""Heavy is the arm that wears its heart on its sleeve."" That's the best way to sum up this overwritten, overlong, stunningly obvious treatise on gender equality, consumerism and existentialism, whose messages get beaten to death beginning early on and never let up, an exhausting experience, to be sure. Writer-director Greta Gerwig's latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that's about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What's more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like ""writing"" than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, ""Barbie"" does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I'll easily forget before year's end - and one that conclusively proves the power of effective marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.",5
" For the whole family
","Laugh out loud humor, fantastic sets and costumes that contain a wonderful message. I took my teenage daughter and preteen son and we all were incredibly surprised by exactly how much we enjoyed the entire film. I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again. So do I because I think I will find deeper concepts on a 2nd watch. And the music was phenomenal!",10
" Pleasantly surprising piece of work, and a deserved hit
","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful<br><br>Barbie (Margot Robbie) is one of the many Barbies living in Barbieland, living a happy, carefree life partying and living it up with her friends, in spite of everyone holding down top positions in demanding roles. Suddenly, she suffers an existential crisis, wondering about death, caused by her owner, fifteen year old Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt.) In order to sort it out, she must travel to the real world and connect with her owner, only for Ken (Ryan Gosling) to hitch a ride along with her. On arrival, Barbie is rejected by her owner, and discovers a world where men rule, which Ken is enamoured by. Upon their return to Barbieland, he uses this model to take over, thrusting Barbie into a desperate battle to regain control, and discover the true nature of things in the process.<br><br>When it was first released back in the summer, there was a furore around the Barbie movie, as it was released at the same time as the Oppenheimer film, and there was a big uproar about which film was going to win at the box office, with some medical experts even concerned the crowds soaring to see both films would make the Covid numbers go up again. Thankfully, that didn't appear to have been the case, but while both films have been phenomenally successful, Barbie has gone on to be the most successful film of the year, and now I've finally got round to seeing it. And, given it was inevitable that I eventually would, I can say I'm quite glad I did.<br><br>It was easy enough from the very beginning to dismiss, just from the premise (a film about Barbie dolls, now?) and the central premise does feel a bit flimsy to begin with, but it does gradually develop into something more substantial and affecting, with a moving and engaging story about self discovery. Another bugbear to quash is the film's apparent 'hatred of men.' While the themes do revolve around the patriarchy and toxic masculinity, it does also address the issues of emasculation and gender norms expected of men to live up to, and its all done in such a jovial, non preachy way that it's very unlikely to really rub anyone up the wrong way.<br><br>From a premise so fluffy comes something so much more multilayered, a far fetched conception that addresses much deeper issues, with a touching undercurrent and a generally fun, funky nature, with a more than decent soundtrack (not including the much despised 90's Aqua tune.) ****",9
" Abosolutely the best
","Come on Barbie, let's go smash the patriarchy!<br><br>Greta Gerwig is the freaking best!! Looking at all the one/two stars reviews written by obviously male audience (or males who haven't watched it, just wanna express their fragile and insecure masculinity) makes this film even more ironic and a mirror of our society. Brava, Gerwig!<br><br>Must take your boyfriends, straight male friends, brothers to watch this film, a good way to educate them or you know, get the hell out of the relationship while you still can.<br><br>It's not just a simple film anymore, it's a sensational experience, a work of new generation. Maybe it's not perfect, but we need this, the society need this, the straight white male dominated Hollywood absolutely need this.",10
" Barbie Had Potential
","Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a very interesting watch for a person like me. I'm the type of guy this movie makes fun of in it's two-hour runtime (I enjoy Zack Snyder's Justice League and The Godfather), and it certainly was a weird experience. So, yes, Barbie obviously isn't for me, but I'm going to do my best to give my actual complaints about the film without making it sound like I'm butthurt about its jokes about the patriarchy.<br><br>First of all: it gets far too preachy. Gerwig could've kept the message of feminism in Barbie, but she could've made it so much subtler than it is. There are constant speeches about feminism and patriarchy. I mean, it gets crammed down your throat about every fifteen minutes. The worst one was when a tween (yes, a literal twelve year old) started preaching to Barbie about consumerism, fascism, and capitalism like she was Jaden Smith talking about the political and economic state of the world. It was insane and laughable.<br><br>Second of all: the messaging was really messed up and concerning. The end of the movie felt like it was setting up for an actually sweet and heartwarming ending about equality, but it was ruined when the Barbies refused to give the Kens any equality. What the heck was the movie even for then? The Barbies went through literally no character development while the Kens were actually funny and had the only development in the film. Also, the way the Barbies regained power in Barbie Land was baffling. No joke, they ended up making it look like they were cheating on their Ken boyfriends to make the Kens jealous of each other so they would fight. There were absolutely no reprocussions the Barbies had to face for doing this. It was insane. The movie basically taught little girls they should manipulate guys and make them jealous of each other to get what they want.<br><br>Third of all: Will Ferrell is wasted. He is a big part of the first half of the movie but just kinda disappears in the second half. It's almost like Gerwig forgot about his character but then said ""oh yeah, it's Will Ferrell, we should probably give him a quick scene at the end.""<br><br>The only part I really enjoyed in this film was Ryan Gosling and all the other Kens. He is an absolute scene stealer. No one clapped when the movie ended, but people (including me) clapped when Gosling finished his ""Just Ken"" song. It was hilarious. You can tell he was really having fun with it. But all the other actors are just meh. Margot Robbie looks like Barbie, yes, but she doesn't really do anything else to stand out.<br><br>Overall, Barbie is just wasted potential. What a shame.",2
" A movie for everyone (yes, even men)
","I anticipated this movie long before it came out and already watched it twice in the cinema. Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.<br><br>The performances where wonderful, particularly that of Ryan Gosling who really tapped into his Kenergy. I thought it was interesting to see that not only Barbie aka Margo Robbie got a character arc, where she got to grow up to become a woman. Also Ken aka Ryan Gosling underwent some significant character growth that I much appreciated.<br><br>As the trailer said; If you love Barbie, you will love this film. If you hate Barbie, you will still love this film. Because it isn't only about a doll, but also about the patriarchal system we all have to deal with on a daily basis and about the complexity that is human life in general. Who would have thought a movie about Barbie could do such things?",10
" Everything is war(minor spoilers)
","Starting off exciting and upbeat the movie quickly spirals into endless monologues about the patriarchy.<br><br>Occassionally there's upbeat dance scenes with Ken(Ryan Gosling) spread throughout the movie.<br><br>With a strong posse of neo-feminist activists leading the war effort against the dumb Ken's - Kate McKinnon leads well.<br><br>Michael Cera and Will Ferrell are in their least funny roles ever.<br><br>Margot Robbie plays well, as well as I expected the movie to be but the movie is mostly negative, I could deal with alot of it in good spirit, but the flogging was extensive and I'm all beat up now. Will never watch this movie again - it's terrible.",5
" I loved it
","Barbie was an incredible movie and experience. There was a perfect balance between the replication of our own childhood experiences with the dolls, and the introduction of the hopeful changes for the current state of the world. The way the movie made our little imaginations come to life on the big screen was magical. It was great to see a movie about barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll , being so inclusive and aware of issues we still have today. It was emotional, funny, and a breath of fresh air. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the rest of the cast... just bravo. It was truly so wonderful &amp; I can't wait to watch it again.",10
" Surprising
","This movie definitely wasn't what I expected it to be. Although it was funny, it also had me question a lot of things in life. It hit the heart, it made me cry, and it really shows what the reality of the real world was and how we can all discover ourselves and not be making ourselves into someone we aren't. I walked into the theater thinking it would be all fun and like any other Barbie animation made in the past, but it definitely stood out and all the actors did great. Most women will definitely feel a sense of courage to do what they want in life and maybe also the men.<br><br>This was a 10/10 movie. Definitely recommend to watch.",10
" A beautiful portrayal of negativity of real world with humor
","It was beautiful and brilliant, didn't expect it's gonna be too good. Greta tells the -ve side of the real world beautifully wrapped in humor and childhood nostalgia for many.<br><br>Margot is the STAR, she's unreal man, whatever role she does it seems she's born for that.<br><br>Ryan was brilliant and so was Will Ferrel, both did an outstanding job. The take on patriarchy is nicely done, Greta is a brilliant director.<br><br>Just speechless to see how Margot Robbie every single time nail the character she plays, she's just outstanding whether it's Harley or Barbie, she's born to play these roles.<br><br>Go and experience the Barbie world.",8
" Barbie in two words: Stereotypical. Cliche.
","Outstanding cast that tried to save a shortsighted and predictable storyline. Gosling once again shows that he's in a class of his own. Barbie started out fun but shortly into the film, the vibe changes and things take a turn for the worse. The room changes from lighthearted laughter, excitement, and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily. Our fun and bubbly Barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche, hashed-out stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman. Sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from Ryan Gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well. Seems like whoever made this movie had issues that they wanted us all to deal with instead of telling us a great story.",4
" Actually better than Oppenheimer
","I've got to say that the Barbenheimer marketing strategy has proven to be nothing short of genius. I was always going to see ""Oppenheimer"" but ""Barbie"" not so much. Without knowing anything about it I'd already labelled it as a brash kids movie. A typical Ken move.<br><br>Still the marketing got me and praise be for that. ""Barbie"" is an absolute riot, a real fever dream that gets its point across with considerable finesse and charm. I certainly didn't find it to be heavy-handed in either the first or second half.<br><br>And what halves they are! The first hour is just a rush of pink and songs and clothes and dreams. The creators of the film just dial everything to the maximum and go all in on Barbieland. And it shows. It's all just so spot on.<br><br>In the second hour the real world intrudes and actually that works well too. Ken finds himself, everything changes in Barbieland and the only way back involves both Barbie and Ken growing as people.<br><br>I especially enjoyed the moments that highlighted the absurdity of women trying to meet high and directly conflicting standards in the modern world. Even as a guy this message resonated.<br><br>But I also enjoyed the insane dance sequences, the absurd songs, the in-jokes and really just about all of the aspects of ""Barbie"". It hits the mark which is quite some compliment for a movie built around a globally marketed doll. Well done I say!",9
" Not so good...
","At the beginning there were little girls playing with dolls. Then came Barbie. The narrator said something about them pretending to be mothers to their dolls and then they (the little girls/toddlers) began to destroy their dolls. I don't know about you, but for me, they imply that being a mother is somewhat something negative. Barbie is meant to inspire young girls to be whatever they want, but why do they suddenly make it sound like wanting to be a mother is not something good they can strive to be? So if a little girl wants to be a doctor or an astronaut, that's fine (it is), but if she wants to be a mother, it sounds as if it is frowned upon. Tsk tsk.<br><br>Also, I just can't understand why Barbie and Ken can't be equals. Why do we need one extreme or the other? Why do we need to have COMPETELY Barbie or COMPLETELY Ken? Why can't it be BarKen land? Or KenRie land? You may argue that at the end they somewhat reach equality between Barbie and Ken, but in my opinion, it's not true. Barbies ""allow"" the Kens to also be politicians, but just at a lower ranking. That's equality? I also noticed that once Barbie and Ken first went into the real world, Ken saw that men can also have jobs. From my point of view, he was just very excited that he, a man, could also have a job, but he just became an extreme.<br><br>Honestly, we have fought for equality, and what is this? Teaching young children that you can only have one or the other, but not a balance? Doesn't this remind you of 60-70 years ago?",5
" perfect.
","Everything was just so perfect. The cast, margot robbie is basically my fav person and ryan is also nice.. ig. I love how they added some actors from sex education like emma, connor and ncuti. The design was unbelievably perfect as well, the soundtrack, THE MESSAGE, EVERYTHING. I JUST LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH. It felt relatable, felt so many kinds of emotions at once which was an amazing and unique experience. LOVED IT GRETA AND MARGOT DID SO WELL!! I also loved how there were so many kinds of barbie's, like transgender barbie, allan which i think is non-binary and more.",10
" Amazing!
","Great film which has a good balance between politics, feminism and film making. It was funny, sad and exciting, with great acting to pull it off. The set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line. The ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively. Mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they weren't necessary to be discontinued. Overall a great film and good to see with the family, it would be really recommended if you have younger children! They should love it.",10
" For the people who do not wish to wish the ugliness of the world
","There are a lot of mixed reviews about this film and I really do not understand the point the people that do not like it are making. Nowadays I feel like we are too insensitive to what actually is happening in the world around us. I've read reviews stating that this movie is too heavy-handed and trying to be feminist and political. And yet Oppenheimer got more reviews and stars despite it being 100% political. It's like the world is doing exactly what the Barbie movie tells is happening. There is a serious divide in the way people approach feminism and it is honestly really sad that people think that this movie is ""Pitting men against women"" and vice-versa. Although I do not agree with the ending statement of the movie, ""And the Kens one day will achieve as much power in the Barbie land as women hold in the real world"", but in the end Barbie land is really just a reflection of the real world, just opposite, in order to open people's eyes to the fact that yes, women are discriminated against still and that they do not hold much power and autonomy in our world even today.",10
" Just absurd!
","I can't understand who are the target group of the film.<br><br>The writing of the characters are weirdly off compared to their animated ones.<br><br>A kid behind us asked her mother ""What is Barbie or Ken (doing/ saying) here?"". I couldn't answer to any of the questions myself.<br><br>The only think I liked was the ending (the part with the song of B. Eilish), because it made sense.<br><br>I didn't like the representation of woman and man. This is not the way it is or should be. Both are important for a society to work. I was waiting for the movie to end, just to find out where it was going.<br><br>It's sad to present another universe and because it's fiction, normalise hypothetical situations that are just bad for humanity and not good example for young children.<br><br>I was waiting for something totally different.",3
" ""Sublime!"" -Ken, 2023
","One of the most affectionately crafted and truly hilarious films of all time!<br><br>Usually, a slight exhale through my nose is enough for me to classify a movie as funny but 'Barbie' had me laughing loud enough to annoy the whole cinema. It was jam-packed with line after line after line of hilarity - I couldn't even get a chance to catch my breath! Greta Gerwig's script had me snorting and crying from laughter, especially when paired with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's flawless delivery of it.<br><br>'Barbie' was full of such in-touch and specific references that the whole audience could relate to. From the Kens mansplaining 'The Godfather' to the inclusion of Weird Barbie who'd been ""played with too hard"", Gerwig made the film feel highly personal, which is quite a feat considering the impersonal nature of the subject of the movie.<br><br>But it was more than just a comedy; the film touched on much deeper themes of feminism and existentialism. When Barbie left the matriarchy of Barbie Land and entered the Real World, the film acted as a political and social commentary on issues surrounding misogyny and womanhood. With Gerwig's depiction of not only what it means to be a woman, but also what it means to be human, she beautifully and skillfully brought the humanity to a plastic doll.<br><br>The set design, casting, acting, writing and directing were all executed phenomenally and came together to create a poignant, multifaceted and rollicking movie. In Ken's wise words, it absolutely was ""sublime""!",10
" Marketing con, the worst film I've seen in years
","A word of advice. Don't waste your money and time going to see the Barbie movie. Went with the whole family (including my 12 year old daughter and wife) and they asked to leave before it was over, it was that bad. I think it's been 30 years since I walked out of a movie theater because the movie was so, so bad. I don't know how it's been so successful. Marketing at its best (or worst). It's boring, disjointed, and sexist (to both men and women). It's an unwatchable mess, and by the last 20 minutes we cared so little about the characters, that we just left. It's horrendous. Save two hours of your life and don't bother watching.",1
" Fun filled with depth
","Greta Gerwig hasn't missed yet with a film but this film is her first larger budget film. Similar to The Lego Movie, this film appears to be a harmless, funny commercial with a simple message but also like The Lego Movie, great writing and performances make it a heartfelt film with strong themes and messages.<br><br>The plot is fairly straightforward with our main Barbie going on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, while Ken does the same. A simple premise but well executed. The plot deals with themes such as gender, equality, the loss of childhood and the nature of growing up with such good humour and heart. I had a smile on my face the entire time.<br><br>The performances are strongest from the two leads, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Both bring a lot of energy and life to Barbie and Ken, communicating the struggles of being both a man and woman and how one can't exist without the other. They have excellent chemistry and both inject their roles with great emotion. The rest of the cast are good though some felt unnecessary. Will Ferrell's CEO could have benefitted from more screen time or could've even been cut completely. Yet he is still hilarious in the scenes he is in.<br><br>The set design is immaculate, Barbieland was a joy to witness. My only issue is we could've spent more time there. The score was great and the cinematography further helped with the immersion. Production-wise this film is gorgeous.<br><br>The only problems are a few too many times of the film hammering it's message in to the point it can become annoying. There are also a few lines and jokes that don't land at all and seem entirely of the time. Yet, these are minor in the face that everything does right.<br><br>Overall, Barbie is a lot of fun, with great comedy and a lot of heart. The leads are great, the set design is immaculate and the message is strong and positive. A fun film that I highly recommend.",8
" Pretty Pink
","Barbie is a beautifully heart-warming extravaganza for both boys and girls alike. A gloriously pink, joy-filled experience that I can't wait to go and see again. From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.<br><br>I can't pay more respect to the cast, Margot Robbie as stereotypical Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken are the obvious standouts, they certainly delivered on the hype - but I was pleasantly surprised by Will Ferrell's short but hilarious moments on screen as well as Michael Cera as Alan (a true unsung hero).<br><br>As mentioned, the set design is really quite stunning. Gazing upon Barbie land in all it's pink glory is pure joy, there is no doubt the set design is one of the films greatest strengths. But Barbie doesn't just look great, it sounds great with its vibrant collection of tracks and performances (including Ryan Gosling and his guitar).<br><br>Barbie wraps up all the fun and colour with a solid story and strong positive message that fits perfectly in the world Greta Gerwig created. Of course some people may not enjoy the social commentary that pervades Barbie but I believe Greta Gerwig laid out the foundations for such a message perfectly, empowering girls and boys of all ages.<br><br>Barbie feels like a must see movie, it built the hype and then delivered exceptionally. If you haven't been tempted yet you're missing out on all the fun that this beautiful movie has to offer.",10
" Exactly what it should be
","Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.<br><br>There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right! The casting was incredible. Even Ryan Gosling, who I beforehand thought was too old, was great and obviously well chosen for this role. Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin.<br><br>There is diversity, modern issues and a whole lot of fun, the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing. I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye-opener to many people (admittedly, mostly men) on how society views women in day-to-day life.",9
" Not for those expecting a fun slice of nostalgia
","I saw this movie expecting a bit of fun with perhaps some moral messages and a few jokes thrown in for the grown-ups. Perhaps pitched slightly older than the pixar films. What I got was a movie that had me laughing in some spots while other spots had me thinking, ""what on earth am I watching.""<br><br>I know Barbie better than you're average middle age guy since I've been buying special edition Barbie dolls for years for my (now adult) daughter who collects them. The movie did a great job of showing some of the classic outfits and play sets that would have been recognised by the fans so the nostalgia fuel was definitely there. Cameos from unexpected stars were also a treat.<br><br>There were some legitimately hilarious moments. Such as the quip about N Sync which gave me a smile - given Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake's shared history (they both starred in the Mickey Mouse club show - plus the long running rumours about Gosling almost becoming a member of rival band Backstreet Boys). A huge laugh in the cinema came from Narrator Helen Mirren's quip about casting. The casting itself was great, especially Robbie and Gosling who were both superb in their respective roles.<br><br>Other than the humourous moments, there were also moments that were uncomfortable or downright depressing. It's not uncommon to have moments like that in comedy movies or kids movies. In this movie though, they out-weighed the lighter moments. The marketing certainly didn't lead me to expect a movie that would leave me feeling depressed afterward. Despite being based on one of the most popular toys of all time, it's definitely not a movie that was made for kids.<br><br>There has always been controversy around Barbie's awkward relationship with feminism. The movie attempted to address equality by showing a Barbieland where females dominated and males like Ken were treated unfairly. Then contrasting that with the real world where men dominate and women are treated unfairly. It's a legitimate message and I expected it to build up to a conclusion showing that neither should be the case and everyone should be equal. They attempted that, but pretty much glossed over it before rushing on to the ending which was one of the film's biggest ??? Moments. The speeches about patriarchy were valid but were also dragged out repeatedly over the last half of the film in such a heavy handed manner that many would have tuned out from that message. Meanwhile, any attempt at promoting equality was undermined by every single man I remember in the film being portrayed as adorably failing at being macho, or completely stupid. In most cases both. Of course the barbies were barbies but the real world women were portrayed as being regular, intelligent women. Not cartoonish buffoons like all the men were.<br><br>On balance, I can now understand all the comparisons between this movie an Oppenheimer. The difference is that your average viewer would watch Oppenheimer expecting a lot of it to feel oppressive and depressing.",5
" Amazing
","This movie was definitely made for everybody. It had hilarious scenes and a few sad ones. And I was always told when a movie makes you laugh and cry, it's a great movie. The plot and message was unexpected, in a good way though. I could also tell that it touched people. In the theatre, I heard "" oh my god,"", sniffles, and gasps. The cast and acting was off the top and the detail was, too. Although, you may here some comments saying, "" Oh this movie is sexist against men,"". You really have to see the movie to understand it. The people that are saying those things, obviously have not seen the movie. It's just so good, I would be able to watch this everyday. It is definitely worth the money to see it.",10
" Such wasted potential
","Today I went to see this movie and I was so excited. I loved barbie growing up and watched all the movies, this week I played the Dua Lipa Barbie song on repeat and showed up to watch it in my barbie jumper.<br><br>I loved the start of it, it was fun and colourful. Ken was hilarious and I got the feeling the plot was going to be about Barbie trying to find a purpose like all the other barbies and Ken becoming his own person but I was really wrong.<br><br>It took a weird twist and turned into this femenist, anti-men, preachy movie that really took all the fun out of it. The movie said Patriarchy more than it said Barbie and completely dumbed men down just to make the women look better. The movie constantly preached about equality but the film ended with the kens pleading for jobs but being refused. Complete waste of potential.",4
" Fun, unforgetable movie
","This is the best movie I've seen in last 5 years. It's fun from beginning till the end. It is just what you would expect from a barbie movie, but it's also so much more. The plot is excellent, there is a lot of cool cameos and there is a new surprise in every second of the movie. It's unpredictable, so funny and it's also kind of deep. Would recommend 10/10.",10
" 10/10 amazing, a must see, not just a ""girly"" movie
","I thought the movie was amazing. Full of nuances.<br><br>It is an incredible movie that goes in a completely different direction then I thought it would. I loved how they didn't shy from the perception of Barbie. Also, it was very well cast, the characters were all fantastic. This isn't just a ""girls"" movie, either! I absolutely loved it. I wouldn't change a thing. I laughed, I cried, I was entertained the entire movie. The jokes were intelligent and a bit edgy. It may look like a silly action adventure, but textured dialog and rapid-fire gags add important layers of meaning. Great actors - great way of portraying silly messages and wonderful way of getting the important messages out as well. The movie had a great combination of humor and message.<br><br>As someone else wrote in an editorial ""superficial yet smart, caustic yet clever, and showcasing not just the very best but even the worst of all things Barbie. No stone is left unturned and no doll is left behind.""",10
" Hi Barbie!
","Greta Garwig is a pretty interesting filmmaker as her previous works on ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"" were pretty good. Here, ""Barbie"" is really wild but I had a really fun time watching it. Throughout, the colorful pink designs, models, background, settings and structures were pretty good as it helps add the film's purposeful tone and atmosphere all together. Written by Noah Baumbach, the narrative is pretty good as it's clear the film doesn't take itself seriously and explores some pretty interesting satirical themes that worked well together with the story. All the performances were pretty good especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as they have pretty great chemistry with one another. The characters were really fun to watch as it was fun to see all the Barbies, Kens, Allen, and the real world characters interact and perform on the screen.<br><br>Many elements like the narrative, structures, tone, humor, and style were pretty good as Garwig's direction and Baumbach's writing helped to carry the film with some great satirical dramatic tones throughout. The soundtrack was pretty good although there were an few soundtracks choice was that were kind of bad (that Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj ""Barbie World"" was horrendous) and a few writing moments that could have been a little better.<br><br>For the most part, Barbie succeeds because the film understands itself with its non-serious tone and provides a fun and bright entertainment of a film. Oppenheimer and Barbie indeed makes a great double feature.",8
" Um...bizarre is the best word I can use to describe this.
","I'm not sure what the writers and director are trying to say with this film, but I'm certain that it is 100% a vehicle to sell all the iterations of the boys' and girls' dolls and all their accessories.<br><br>It doesn't paint the manufacturer in a good light, making the CEO (Ferrell, whom I heartily dislike anyway) a buffoon, along with all the men who occupy the boardroom.<br><br>It makes several well-placed jabs at patriarchy, and the real world, but seems disjointed and searching for a meaningful plot. I swear, this is the last Gerwig movie I will subject myself to, because I find all of her films to date to be confusing and pointless.<br><br>The two leads (Robbie and Gosling) are perfect, as is the rest of the cast, especially Kate McKinnon as the weird doll. (I refuse to write the names of the manufacturer or the dolls as my own little protest of blatant consumerism and marketing to children.) Just once, I'd like to watch a film directed toward children that doesn't include superheros, blowing up things, violence, or product placement.",3
" ""Barbie"" should be the only movie I can give 10/10 this year.
","""Barbie"" should be the only movie I can give 10/10 this year. Both the rhythm of the plot, the tribute to the toy are perfect. Also, from feminism and women's own awakening to the awakening of self is the perfect theme. The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify. Let's hope Mattel releases more and better Barbie in the coming years. I really hope you guys could come to cinema and see this movie.",10
" Terribly overrated claptrap.
","In which Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach recycle their failed 30 minute Black Mirror idea and pad it out to a full two hour shaggy dog tale, of little or no consequence, whilst breaking the hearts of nine year old girls worldwide who flock in their millions to a movie that flies straight over their heads.<br><br>To be fair the first three minutes are awesome when they pastiche 2001 A Space Odyssey (but we'd already seen it in the trailer). And Margot Robbie is breathtakingly beautiful from start to finish.<br><br>Ryan Gosling's faye Ken is, by contrast, just a bit annoying, (and to be fair, so is Robbie) but neither are as gratingly garbage as Will Ferrell and his bunch of Mattel men.<br><br>Other highlights include Billie Eillish's stunningly gorgeous closing music which gets all existential on us.<br><br>The design is, to a point, quite fun but not consistently so and the morale of the story, or the political polemic about equal rights for women, does not fail to land, although it does so in a Groundhog sort of manner.<br><br>This is not a good movie. Gerwig, Baumback, Robbie and Gosling have all done significantly superior work. This is quite simply a bunch of talented people having a laugh and getting away with it.<br><br>Hats of to Mattel for allowing a lot of self deprecation on their part and to the profits it will have raised for their mighty corpioration.<br><br>But is this good cinema? No, it is not.",5
" Barbie Is Quite Insightful
","I was excited to see what this movie would delve into, and it being from a woman's point of view sounded promising. I was expecting a fun, slightly superfluous film, but safe to say, it was so much more than that.<br><br>The first thing I'd like to point out is the meticulous outfit designing, it perfectly encapsulates the energy of Barbie, but with a modern touch.<br><br>The dreamhouse was designed with attention to even the tiniest details.<br><br>I loved how a lot of elements of the movie were portrayed from the viewpoint of a little girl - The lack of water in Barbieland, Barbie ""flying"" to her car, and the 'world' map.<br><br>The movie just kept getting more and more enthralling. The exploration of the patriarchy in the 'real' world is eerily accurate. The raw, unadulterated expression of the dilemmas of womanhood is one which speaks for women and girls all around the world.<br><br>I appreciate how the movie concluded with not the return of the matriarchal Barbieland, but an effort to strive for equilibrium, which acknowledges the sentiments of both men and women, which is a progressive message to carry out.<br><br>Handler's dissertation on the immortality of ideas, and essence of humanity was quite profound.<br><br>The acting, everyone's, was entertaining and impeccable, without it , the movie could never be just as good.<br><br>The soundtrack, while song-oriented, was still effective at projecting the vibe and aesthetic of the movie into one's ears.<br><br>Overall, this movie is more than just ""glitter and sparkles"", it symbolically confronts the facets of our society. It is truly a film, anyone,
Barbie fan or not, can appreciate, and should watch.",10
" Very entertaining
","This was a totally enjoyable movie and it started off with like the planet of the apes with the old fashion girls with the old babies dolls. I was the generation that started with Barbie so I thought it was very entertaining and more importantly I thought the costumes were totally spot on for the Barbie character as well as the Ken character.<br><br>It kinda remind me of the Flintstone movie I saw years ago, but the designs were great and the costuming was great and the hall simplicity of Barbie and her Barbie village vibe was great.<br><br>I'm not going go into any more details, but I would say that I would watch it again because it was an entertaining, and Ken was great, as well as Will Ferrell as the chairman of Mattel, and then Rhea Perlman being the maker of Barbie.<br><br>Watch it! It will lighten your day

" Total Delight!
","Wish I could give Barbie 11 stars! I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a very long time! In fact, I've already seen it FOUR times and if I can find another friend who hasn't seen it yet, I'll go again!<br><br>There is music and dancing and laughter and even a couple tears. The dialogue is often surprising. And yes, it packs a beautiful message, too. This movie has it all! Margot Robbie is the perfect ""stereotypical Barbie"" and Ryan Gosling is absolutely hilarious as Ken. But really the entire cast is terrific. I especially loved the inclusion of weird Barbie and Allen.<br><br>Some seem to think it's anti-men. No way! It is anti-patriarchy, but that's not the same thing. If you haven't seen it, go now!

" O tempora o mores
","This film quickly loses the plot and so do you. I feel like the writers decided to put EVERYTHING in it and address EVERY audience. Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) does it successfully. So does The Matrix (1999) and when it comes to visiting parallel worlds, or escapism, Beauties of the Night (1952) or even Alice in Wonderland (1951) are far better. Paroles, paroles, paroles, that's what Barbie's all about. Actually everything in this movie sounds old, tired and stale. People Will Talk (1951) still sounds fresh comparing to this. Or Kiss and Make Up (1934) that also deals with male-female relationships and beauty standards.<br><br>Some of the films about empowerment and diversity that beat Barbie on every possible level are: The Iron Jawed Angels (2004), Million Dollar Baby (2004), Boys Don't Cry (1999), Amelia (2009), Amélie (2001), Little Miss Sunshine (2006), The Heiress (1949), Mildred Pierce (1945), Kitty Foyle (1940), Ninotchka (1939), 9 to 5 (1980), Working Girl (1988), Precious (2009), The Color Purple (1985), Hairspray (1988), My Beautiful Laundrette (1985), Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), The First Wives Club (1997), Alien (1979), Halloween (1978), Trading Places (1988) and the list goes on. Hilary Swank is in four of them, so give that girl an extra cookie! Also, all of Katharine Hepburn, Glenda Jackson, Bettie Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Mae West, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford films exude empowerment. You don't have to figure it out, it will simply posses you.<br><br>The visuals in Barbie seem AI. I'm not a fan of digital effects so maybe that's why I wasn't impress. I grew up watching Classic Hollywood musicals. The choreography, the dancing &amp; singing skills, the costumes and all of that in Technicolor or in beautiful black and white was so much more effective than this. All That Jazz (1979), American in Paris (1951), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), The Red Shoes (1948), Lady in the Dark (1944), all of Fred &amp; Ginger films and those choreographed by Busby Berkeley are far more spectacular and better produced than Barbie.<br><br>The characters are not sympathetic to me and the cathartic moment in the film when Barbie achieves her humanity by discarding Ken is also the moment when I don't care what she does. The movie has already been too long, there has already been a lot of senseless running around, in and out of Barbieland, like watching too many episodes of the latest Turkish soap opera with your mum, the drama, the subversion, the subversion of the subversion, the flat feet, the cellulite, the arrest, the chase with the men in black, the meeting with your maker... I wouldn't care if the two of them ended up going on a holiday with Slavoj Zizek. Though, that would be something. So, in conclusion, if you want to see a heartwarming movie about a doll that becomes human, I recommend Pinocchio (1940).",1
" There seems to be a lot underneath the surface
","The most basic touchstone for a movie that I can think of is -- is this worth seeing again? For Barbie the answer is yes. There is so much going on in the background of every scene and such incredible detail and craftmanship. I can imagine Oscars coming for set design or costuming or those kinds of awards.<br><br>It wasn't quite what I expected. For one thing, it was way more meta than even the trailers indicated. The characters not only switch back and forth from Barbieland to the Real World, but also co-exist both inside and outside the basic storyline. And there were some genuine surprises, like Rhea Perlman's captivating role as Barbie's inventor Ruth Handler, who somehow stands outside everything; and Helen Mirren's wise narrator. There's loads of fun and clever dialog built on the Barbie world, but overall, director Greta Gerwig seems to be using all this as a platform for saying things about women in society and the nature of femininity. Which is what she did in Little Women (2019) but for a different century and place. So there is a Message here that gets a bit heavy by the end, and maybe a bit dated? But that doesn't bring the whole thing down by any means.<br><br>Every part of this production is incredibly well thought out. Even the action scenes are toy-like in feel, and the dialog at times seems like it's being made up as it goes along, which is just what happens while girls play with dolls. The dance numbers have great choreography, particularly the Kens-in-black-and-white scene that brings to mind things like the Gene Kelly musicals of the 1950's.<br><br>Another surprise was America Ferrara as Gloria, the real-world and very ordinary woman trying to get along with her prickly daughter (Ariana Greenblatt). Her big scene toward the end where she lets it rip about how hard it is just to make do as a woman -- ending up with her appeal to the Mattel execs to come up with an Average Woman Barbie -- is a real highlight. And then of course there are all the Kens. Ryan Gosling expertly steals just about every scene he's in, but first and foremost, this movie is correctly about Barbie(s) and it stays that way.",8
" As heavy handed as a movie can be
","Barbie was a huge surprise in both a positive and negative way. On the upside, I was not expecting as many solid comedy moments and stellar performances by Gosling and Robbie. I was expecting the PG-13 rating to be a bit more for show but it is used to good comedic effect on a number of occasions.<br><br>The biggest surprise was how effective the marketing team behind this film was. They were not only able to elevate initial hype by tying themselves to a Nolan film, but they were also able to completely disguise what the film was about. Trailers would lead you to believe this will be a fun-loving comedy with some character moments, some heart, and a lot of nostalgia. Instead, Barbie's central theme and main plot revolve around the least nuanced take on feminism I have seen to date. I would not be surprised if this script was made by having a 10 year old girl describe the basics of patriachry to an AI, specify that it should make an over-exaggerated mean spirited narrative from it, and then have some of the most unintelligent writers in hollywood tack on a monologue for the human character at the end. That final monologue by the mother is one of the most insufferable things I have experienced in a movie theater.",3
" Barbie delivers plenty of good, hilarious fun
","As the film's trailer suggests, whether you like or dislike Barbie dolls and merchandise, there's still plenty of things to enjoy about Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie."" Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are brilliantly cast as Barbie and Ken where they both have awesome chemistry and share plenty of hilarious moments on-screen. I should also add that Gosling delivers what's probably one of the best musical solos of the year next to Jack Black's performance in The Super Mario Bros Movie.<br><br>""Barbie"" is not only an eccentric, goofball comedy but also a thought-provoking film with a post-feminist take on gender roles and gender stereotypes in current society, something highly reminiscent of movies such as ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""Down With Love."" On that note, America Ferrera's powerful monologue near the end of ""Barbie"" was on par with Renée Zellweger's speech in ""Down With Love.""<br><br>While the above description might make it sound like the Barbie movie leans too much into polemics for it to be good escapist fun then don't worry, because aside from its core message, it's still oodles of light-hearted, hilarious entertainment for everyone to enjoy from beginning to end.",8
" It's absolutely adorable...
","This was perfectly cast. I mean Ryan Gosling as Ken (I just can not picture anyone else doing it that well). Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera's ""Allan"" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful.",10
" Barbie
","Okey, I get it now.<br><br>Firstly, any comparation with Oppenheimer is out of place. It's something of conjuction and in 5 years nobody will ever put them side by side in a discussion. Both just used this brilliant marketing gimmick to bring people in the cinema. They succeded.<br><br>Right, now about the film. It's fine, it's funny. It has memes. It also has a social commentary regarding genders and their power in society. All fine and dandy but the only conclusion to this is that we all are in a bad spot and only together can get this world on the right track. If you think it's anything else than that you are wrong and should feel bad. Haha.<br><br>I saw this with my wife and she asked me to say something nice about it. I think I did her justice. The change message rings true and strong. Only evolving we will be better together.",8
" More Intrigued by the Films Reception than the Film Itself
","I am shocked at how polarizing this movie has been in terms of feedback. I say this as someone who was not anxiously anticipating its release nor as someone who was triggered by it's growing popularity, I went into this with neutrality. I knew this would have more powerful messaging than it seemed as I am a fan of Gerwigs previous works, but I knew if it did not that the film probably would leave me unfulfilled. For that reason, I was most bored during the first section of the film that was too lighthearted childlike for my taste but I was excited to get into the deeper plot points. This being said, I recognize the film was marketed ingeniously to produce buzz, however it was ineffective in describing what the movie was really about. I can totally see why parents may have thought this was appropriate for children despite the PG-13 rating but this absolutely was not made for kids. This was a campy commentary on the patriarchy in America and the modern feminist movement. These plot points were actually my biggest criticisms of it. From my perspective this displayed an accurate depiction modern feminism, which often neglects to acknowledge it's roots grown by in black feminists and the patriarchies disproportionate effects on low income women, especially those of color. This movie promoted a feminist message that feels decades behind, and in such an obvious way that I am shocked that this explored new ideas or dramatically moved anyone in the audience. It was a blunt reminder of how behind we are but not even through the messaging in the film but rather how viewers are reacting. The only feminist commentary beneath surface level that I would've been more excited to explore were made via side comments from various side characters like the socialist/anarchist daughter (who by the way I found upset to have seen painted as mean and then only kind after conforming to barbie's ideas of feminism, but I digress). With all that being said, it had a fantastic soundtrack, made me laugh quite a few times and Ryan Goslings acting was superb (ironically) although the whole cast did well with the script they were given. Justice for Michael Cera's character! I would've loved to see his cravings to break away from societal norms be further explored! The movie was fun, campy in a more obvious way than I usually like, but that's the mainstream Hollywood box office industry for you. My overall take is this wasn't made for a person like me who craves exploring new ideas or highlighting important calls to action as they relate to feminism rather than this rehashing this surface level anti-patriarchy message. I am glad that this is making people converse in what I'm understanding are new ideas to many, I am just shocked that they are in fact, new.",5

" The HYPE is not real
","It was sooo boring, I could have left in the middle of the film and not care less about what was happening to the characters. I love the cast but everything was soo unfunny. I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is ""The Barbie"" isn't so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator. I Love Greta but it dosen't feel like her. Kinda like with Wednesday not feeling like a Tim Burton thing. But good job with the marketing, it got me.",1
" ""men hate women, women hate women""
","I didn't get emotional whilst watching the movie, but hours later when i looked back on how special this movie is for EVERYONE, especially young girls and women.<br><br>I must have been 8 when i told my mum that i wanted to go on a diet. It's what i saw women doing online and i wanted to be as pretty as they were. Then i grew up and spent so many years being resentful of ""pretty girls"" who i saw daily because they had what i didn't. As a not-conventionally-attractive and disabled woman, i spent days feeling ugly and getting angry at other women and myself because i would never be them or be viewed by other people in the ways that they are. I avoided the mirror for months because i didn't want to see myself. I felt sick looking at my own complexion.<br><br>It took me years to realise that every girl is a pretty girl. Men will put us down and hate this movie because they don't get it. This movie is a beautiful celebration of what it means to be a woman, to get old, to suffer at the hands of a society which forces us against each other.<br><br>Gerwig is and incredible writer and director and seems to outdo her genius with every movie she does.",10
" so fun!
","I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this, english isn't my first language. This is seriously one of the funniest movies i've ever watched. I laughed everytime Ryan Gosling was on screen, he was my favorite in this movie. The only thing i would say wasn't the absolute best was the storyline. I felt like it was like 3 stories all in one movie and they shifted to those stories really fast. I did like the feminist vibe because it was all without hating on men. I think this would be a perfect movie for everyone. In my theater it was mostly young females tho, but i don't think it's made only for them!",10
" Genuinely funny movie, with problems
","A fun experience leading up to Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" was, of course, the marketing campaign and the internet excitement leading up to the film. To me, the success of the movie is so fun since everyone, at least where I am from, was so excited to see it. Thankfully, it think it was worth it. The film succeeds on some levels, most particularly the comedy, performances, and production design. The soundtrack with countless artists and produced by Mark Robson is very fitting as well.<br><br>The movie itself, revolving a Barbie, Margot Robbie, undergoing an existential crisis, is very reminiscent of some movies like ""The Truman Show"" and a little bit like ""The LEGO Movie,"" and it works for the story that is being told. Everything, for the most part, works well, including an astonishingly funny performance from Ryan Gosling. I felt as though he, and of course Margot Robbie as Barbie herself, are the heart and soul of the film. They are amazing in their roles. Michael Cera as the ignored Allan, is perfect as well. Watching this film in a packed cinema was plenty of fun, as most if not everyone reacted strongly to the jokes, and they landed real well. This did a lot for the film as the experience in the movie theatre is huge component for some, which it is for me.<br><br>The plot is imaginative, comedic, a little meta and self aware, and uses its actors real well throughout.<br><br>The issue I have with the film, as I know some also do, is that the film sometimes uses its message a bit too much. Or, in other words, comes of as incredibly strong and intimidating to some. I felt that the message and themes of the movie are good, but some moments just verbally and literally expresses the theme without finess. The movie could have threaded the messages a bit more subtly, but it didn't ruin the movie, at least to me. This is where some people differ in the thoughts and feelings of it, and is a cause to why some people dislike the film. I respect this, but I still enjoyed the movie.<br><br>While the movie isn't necessarily a kids oriented movie, although it is about a children's toy, adults can enjoy the comedy. This is also a negative as some kids will totally miss some jokes, and be left more confused than entertained.<br><br>I recommend watching this movie and having your own view of it, and watching it in the cinema, as any movie, contributes to the fun of it.",8
" Did we all see the same movie?
","I was literally praying to be struck dead so I didn't have to see one more second of this film. Even Margot Robbie couldn't save this over hyped trash. I could feel my IQ drop each minute of the movie that went by. I was amazed, shocked and in horror to see that there were actually people on IMDB none the less who thought this film was ::gasp:: good? Not even close, waste of my time and a waste of my life which I can never get back.<br><br>I'll admit I did laugh at one point however I am not sure if this was due to my sanity slowly slipping away or my braincells seeping from my ear drums. If you hate your life and just want to waste what precious time you have on earth, this is the movie for you.",1
" One of the best Comedies Ever
","Absolutely AMAZING!!!!<br><br>I do not know how it is possible but the Barbie movie exceeded my expectations and then some!!! It was sooooo dang hilarious!!!<br><br>I love the silliness, aesthetics and nostalgia of it all plus the laughs just kept on coming. Of course they had to build a story so there were a few long monologues but there were soooo many laugh out loud moments throughout the whole movie.<br><br>Also, Lets talk about Ryan Gosling...Who knew he was so funny.. He killed it as Ken! I was not expecting him to be so good. I will definitely be going back to the movies to watch it again...<br><br>Oh yeah, BTW Its DEFINITELY PG-13 so I wouldn't bring the kids..",10
" Went and watched this in a packed theater.
",Annnd it was a lot of fun at the beginning but about the time Kate McKinnon came in the movie just died nobody laughed but one lady and she laughed at everything. It was fun but it was about 20 minutes to long for me could cut out most the stuff towards the end. I get it Barbie didn't realize that Ruth was her creator. I don't know if we really need the whole speech either everyone already knows what Barbie is they could cut some out of thst scene it felt like it dragged on a little bit to long. It was nice to see the daughter of the lady who was playing with Barbie turned out to be better then she was at the beginning acting all crazy. Idk this movie felt eh to me.,3
" A hysterically funny and clever triumph from Gerwig
","In the hands of another filmmaker, a ""Barbie"" film could have been a bland or soulless cash-grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic Mattel doll. But cinephiles know that Greta Gerwig's short-but-no-less-impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb, having made two outstanding films (2017's ""Lady Bird"" and 2019's ""Little Women."") Gerwig's films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films. These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing. Needless to say, her take on ""Barbie"" is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth-shattering hype. Gerwig and Baumbach's satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end, while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way. The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original, creative, insightful, and clever than simply just that. The film's jokes come rapid-fire and are consistently hilarious in an intelligent way, even also poking fun at plenty of pop culture and film-related references that cinephiles will adore.<br><br>The consistently entertaining and uproarious script is made more impactful by great performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who are both absolutely joys to watch as Barbie and Ken, respectively. The supporting cast is great too, with standouts being Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera. Another standout of the film is the superb production design and associated aesthetic qualities of Barbie Land, which is absolutely stunning to look at visually. While the film's tone is often comedic (which is great, given how clever and funny it is,) its more serious themes are still handled very sensitively, including a very powerful monologue from America Ferrera and an emotionally engaging resolution to the story. Sharp, incisive, original, and fun, ""Barbie"" is an outstanding movie that audiences will remember long after the credits roll, and I truly can't wait for Gerwig's next film. 9.5/10.",9
" See it for yourself - don't rely on other people's reviews
","Don't let people scare you away from watching this movie, especially if you're a woman. It's definitely more deep than I thought it would be, there were some issues I didn't 100% relate to, and some parts I felt were a tad exaggerated- however I loved it! To those people who say it hates on men, etc: you obviously didn't pay attention. In fact, you should have realized that the way they treat men in the movie is there to show how a lot of women were and still are treated in some ways today. Overall, just watch it with an open mind and take in all of the good messages it has- especially at the end.",10

All genders, all ages, everyone can appreciate it. The entire audience seemed to have a blast throughout the movie. Everyone was laughing during the funny bits(and there were A LOT of them) and during the heartfelt, more emotional moments you could feel the energy shift and the messages the movie was trying to convey really being taken in. Amazing cast, excellent cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, you definitely want to see this one!",10
" I Expected it to be a Lot Better
","In Barbie, there are things that deserve praise.

Second, I expected the movie to have more comic scenes, but it didn't. Third, it is true that some soundtrack parts were good, but some other were not. They were not even attractive to hear and listen to. Forth, it is true that the theme of the story is a new theme to deal with, but I expected the story to have more themes, elements, and depth.<br><br>From my point of view, Barbie is a good movie, and I recommend everyone to watch it. But at the same time, it could have been a lot better. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Barbie 5 out of 10.",5

","I believe that everyone who said it was preachy just doesn't get it, the joy and pain this movie brought me makes it such a wonderful piece of art. The pacing of the movie was excellent as well. I never found myself checking the time waiting for it to end, i was engaged throughout. The comedy in the movie is very well done it felt fresh and not coming across as trying to hard. For me the best part was the end, that beautiful montage of women the cast and crew submitted to remind us that these women are all around us everyday and that we need to love eachother most of all. I will definitely watch it again.",10

It begins very well, but tumbles down from there. Real-world seems more cartoonish than the Barbie world. That could be the real reason for Barbie to come out of Barbie-world and turn into a human. Relatability to any character is zero.<br><br>What waste of two hours of my day!",3

" Barbie (2023, Greta Gerwig) Great movie that walks a fine line between candy colored comedy and modern feminist exclamation point
","Eric's Grade: A-
2023's 'Barbie' from writer/director Greta Gerwig has blown expectations out of the water, and not only become the highest grossing film of the year, but has captured the zeitgeist to become a veritable cultural phenomenon. The film is a fantasy comedy starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling with significant supporting roles going to America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Rhea Perlman and Will Ferrell. The movie is co-written by Gerwig's partner Noah Baumbach. There have been more than a few animated 'Barbie' films, but this is her first foray into live action. As August 2023 comes to an end 'Barbie' has set box office records becoming the highest grossing film of the year, the highest grossing film ever directed by a woman and is in the top twenty highest grossing films of all time.<br><br>Robbie stars as Barbie (technically Stereotypical Barbie) and Gosling is Ken most commonly referenced as Beach Ken. They reside in Barbieland which is a matriarchal utopia where many variations of Barbies and Kens reside in perfect happiness along with a few odd, discontinued Barbie models. These real life dolls are under the impression that life in the real world reflects their happy, unencumbered existence in Barbieland thanks, not in small part, to their very existence and the example they set. Out of the blue Barbie begins having odd feelings of morbidity, and her perfectness is deteriorating. It is determined that her malaise is a reflection of the child playing with her in the real world, and she must journey there and set things aright if she is to get her perfect Barbie groove back. Ken joins her and together they venture to the real world which is not the carefree paradise they believed. Along with that Barbie and Ken discover the nature of the real world patriarchy which Ken attempts to bring back to Barbieland threatening its very existence. It becomes Barbie's mission to not only save the girl who has her doll in the real world, but also restore Barbieland from the lunacy of the Kens' burgeoning patriarchy.<br><br>When I first heard 'Barbie' was being adapted I was more than a bit skeptical. I was intrigued after learning Gerwig and Baumbach were attached as they are at the forefront of some of the more intelligent film making coming out of Hollywood these days. Still how exactly would 'Barbie play? This could be a silly film that turns into a financial disaster. Instead it walked a hyper intelligent line of silly comedy mixed with incisive social satire and feminist messaging. It doesn't do it in a way that talks down to or belittles men though which is also key to an overall success. It taps a similar vein that 'Black Panther' tapped a few years ago for the black community. Here though it taps the often under served female portion of our population. From the opening scene that is a pantomime of the famous '2001: A Space Odyssey"" opening it is clear that this is a film maker in control of her craft and the story she is about to embark on. Especially in this day and age a very blatant feminist core message might not sell, but it does its task in such a fun and subversive way encased in a bright, candy coated shell with catchy music that it is hard not to get on board. If there is any misunderstanding though the message certainly becomes clear in the epic diatribe that is delivered by America Ferrera as Gloria on what it is like and the expectation placed upon being a woman in our modern society. 'Barbie' does an excellent job of dissecting the seeming dichotomy of Barbie itself. That is on one hand the dolls are meant to be empowering for women as the myriad of different Barbies come with different careers and different skin tones, and are meant to show young girls that they can be anything. On the other hand Barbie has become a negative stereotype for a perfect, unattainable idea of womanhood that contributes to many normal girls feeling inadequate in themselves for a myriad of reasons. It has hilarious and pointed commentary on the nature of the patriarchy as Gosling's Ken put the concept in place in Barbieland to both hilarious and appalling effect. About the only thing that didn't work for me in the story is the Mattel board of directors. They are yet another example of the real world patriarchy headed by Ferrell's character. The problem is that the real world is set up as, more or less, a realistic depiction of life in direct counterpoint to the fantasy world that is Barbieland. The exception to that appears to be Mattel and its board of directors which skew towards slapstick lunacy and seem out of place in the primarily real world setting. That aside 'Barbie' is fun and insightful. I think it is clearly targeted toward women and girls especially those with 'Barbie' experience, but it clearly becomes about women as whole. Along with that it is accessible to men who go in with an open mind, and realize that even as the struggle for equality and self fulfillment has come a long way since 1959 that road continues on and does not dead end in the present.",9

" ""Sex Education"" with Barbies
","Greta Gerwig's Barbie is perhaps one of the most ambitious film in recent history. The fact that a filmmaker decides to make a film on such an idea which is equally popular and problematic is brave.<br><br>It is both a celebration as well as a quip on the Barbie world. Barbie deals with the modern day gender issues and how Barbie (the company) stands as a symbol of all those issues. At the same time it cleverly portrays the emotions involved of all those who love and admire this pop symbol.<br><br>Margot Robbie is excellent as Barbie. Her performance range is phenomenal. Gerwig uses her aptly. Gosling is cute and is being judiciously used for his charm and handsome vulnerability that he brings. All the supporting casts (most of them are from just one show hence the title of this review) have done their job well. Can't say I am particularly impressed by any one though as there isn't much for them to do. Although Will Ferrel and America Ferrera are an exception as they shines
in their limited appearance and steal the show.<br><br>The music, production design and direction along with Baumbach's writing is outrageously entertaining and often funny as well. The bizarre world of Barbie will be loved not just by the ones who carry a nostalgic baggage of playing with one in their childhood but also to those who have never ever heard about it. Such is the charm of this movie.",8
" Disappointing
","The first half of the movie was pretty solid. Lots of tongue in cheek and fun humour. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were both very solid casting choices. Will Ferrell, was perfectly cast and hilarious as always. The portrayal of the Barbie world was very well done. The nasty shocks Barbie got when coming into the real world were also very funny. However, the movie soon descended into philosophical and political plot points which just felt weird. If it was just a bit more like Toy Story and a little less like Legally Blonde, it would have been perfect. It just took itself a bit too seriously and just laid some stuff on really thick. It's hard to know who this movie was pitched to. I would have thought it would be for families, but a lot of this would have flown right over many people's heads. It's a shame. It was a good idea, but poorly executed (as many Hollywood products have been recently).",4
" it represents everything a girl is too afraid to say
","The theatre was filled to the brim with 99% women and girls wearing pink, we felt united in the moment of watching such a beautiful film. It's a comedy but it also offers a glimpse into the real world and what it's like for girls and women daily. It was beautiful and i can only wish for more people to go and see it. The laughs and the jokes were only a small portion of the emotions we felt we could just let out, it was emotional in the best way possible and was a moment that i am thankful i could share with my bestfriend.

","LOVED IT. Truly an amazing movie. A lot of people would maybe say that it's boring but to me it was super super cool, it held my attention from start to finish. Not just a movie this thing isnan experience that brings me so much joy if you go to the cinema. So many people there, dressed in pinkish clothes, feels like everyone there is happy and all of people there are unites under the idea of Barbie. The movie itself, has so many great messages to the word. I am sure a lot of little girls didn't quite understand it but they will one day. It also had so many real word/trensing things added to it.<br><br>I probably liked it so much because I grew up watching old barbie movies, and now it felt like Barbie has grown with me, especially cause the topic of the movie was very real in todays world.<br><br>Going in before the movie I thought it would turn out to be just ""okay"" since I saw a lot of parts from it as trailers I thought ""oh I alredy saw it all"", nahh, little did i know. Those trailers are nothing compared to this.<br><br>I really reccomend watching it. But there are some parts that are ""not for kids""(ex.

I was very upset by the number of young kids that I saw at this PG-13 movie.<br><br>Most of the inappropriate things hopefully went over the kids heads, and there were some pretty inappropriate things that were said. I can't repeat them because my mother raised me better.<br><br>I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this movie to only be upset by it.<br><br>I did a double feature today and Haunted Mansion was a much better movie.",4

","I loved all the details and give major props to the director. I feel so happy that we have a movie that is so empowering and really well made. Their was a great balence between each scene and captured the childhood vibes I used to feel when I was young playing with barbies/especially adding the over-used barbie with the cut hair and marked face. I loved each character and the message sent is very powerful and I'm glad for it. Really if anyone has anything negitive to say, think first about all the patriarchal movie that exist first, and let us have one slightly feministic movie without starting ww3, thank yew :)",10
" Worst Barbie movie
","Actors 10/10
production 10/10
plot 2/10
this movie is like a firework, starts bright and promising but ends up fading into the darkness.<br><br>So basically Barbie selfishly sets out to help the girl who is playing her in order to restore her perfection ( wich turns out to be an adult woman) but in the end the girl ends up saving Barbie and Barbieland with little to no resolution to her own problems . But through all this Barbie realises she doesn want to go back to being perfect for everyone to project their ideals on her but just live as a regular human. Cute right? Yeah they only problem is NOTHING was convincing. The adventures of our characters were not enough to transform them yet they did change. The only well developed character was KEN. Not only his character arc was amazing compared to the others, it also was a fine commentary of how patriarchy damages young men. So of it was called Ken then I would have rated it like 7, but its a Barbie movie and unfortunately our female lead had the laziest character arc and the most Deus ex machina development ever.<br><br>Ironically she was through it all really sweet and likeable. Maybe a meta commentary of what women are appreciated for? Sweet and likeable is enough but anything more is too much? And also she only wants to be seen as human? If so i congratulate the movie but i dont think it was clear enough to give it credit for.<br><br>Maybe thats what you get when you are sponsored by whom you are supposed to critique... lol

Everything was that I expected. Pink world and lots of beautiful Barbie's and handsome Ken's gathered together. And it's interesting that just as we played with our dolls, the Barbies in the movie were also taken into play! Then one of my childhood dreams that was Barbie in the real world came true and it was interesting to me...
How wonderful it is that Margot Robbie was chosen to perform this role.. She did it perfectly.",10

It is literally pointed out in the movie how misogyny is a huge problem in the real world and they are upset over one validating movie. Unbelievable. Please ignore the ""anti-man"" reviews. This movie isn't anti-man. If anything, it's anti-patriarchy and makes fun of it.",10
" People are missing the point
","Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.<br><br>In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.<br><br>I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie. But otherwise, Bravo!",9

A couple of touching moments make me not regret seeing it, but it is not going to be on my recommendations lists.<br><br>Lots of fun gags, but they were all over the place and it left main story and main characters arcs bare without enough details to flesh them out.<br><br>So a couple of monologues that were supposed to be a powerful highlight of the movie, ended up landing a bit flat.<br><br>Tokenism seemed superficial, and as such once again more of a distraction from the main story.<br><br>Beautiful moments of Barbie learning to cry that reminded me of the understated magic Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach were able to create in their other works, but it was clearly not the style that matched well with the short attention span of this move.",5

I really enjoyed it! Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie! And Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken! I feel like the chemistry between them and all of the other Barbies and Kens were great!

You can either have a very deep and meaningful plot and some sort of twist to it. Or you can have a very fun watchable movie with an extremely catchy soundtrack. It was pretty much neither.<br><br>The plot of this movie was very basic. Almost felt like a disney movie at times. With this, I thought it would be saved by making it funny and would have a catchy soundtrack.

I heard someone say that the barbie movie Barbie said so many things yet said nothing at all. Meaning it should have been bolder. But I think it said a lot. It doesn't tell you what to think but it's a reflection of the real world that we live in. I'll probably rewatch it just to hear the dialog properly. And I loved the fashion. It made me feel more confident in being a grown woman and not a baby or a teen. It's kind of grownup outfits yet it doesn't hide the fact that women wants to be pretty amd wear high heels, and that it makes them happy.",9
" On surface an 8, underneath a 10
","Barbie had to carry the weight of everyone's expectations (just what the movie is talking about), and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing, perfect and everything in between. The barbie topic, no matter how superficial it may seem, is not easy to grasp and hard to portray. I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not.",10
" Hollywood Discovers Camp - Is It Dead or In Demand?
","This movie was not what I expected at first, but I loved it. It's been years since I watched a new big budget movie that was so bright and fun with its own sense of logic. Taika Waititi said in an interview that Hollywood (particularly superhero) movies have gotten so dark and when he was a kid he went to the cinema to escape the darkness of life. I feel like Barbie could be the start of the un-darkening of Hollywood movies.<br><br>As a woman with some trauma, I love a good gritty woman-run movie that talks about how life feels as a woman in a man's world. Sometimes though, you just want some feel-good escapism that isn't forcing you to watch the female protagonist go through all sorts to get the message across.<br><br>I've seen other reviews say that a lot of the movie didn't make sense. I feel like the way they executed it made sense for a Barbie movie. I've also seen other reviews say that the feminist message of the movie missed the mark since Kens aren't equal in Barbieland, I loved that part especially. In the same way that I don't like feminine trauma being graphically shoved in my face in a movie for the sake of a thinly veiled message, I think it also sucks when a movie takes *too* light of an approach because it's scared to actually say something. Of course the Kens aren't equal in Barbieland 1) Ken was literally invented as a boyfriend for Barbie because parents thought a single lady with a job was ""loose"" and 2) they are toys made by people, they are a product (lol) of their makers. So yes, Barbies are in charge, but Barbieland is just another world created by men and the ideology of misogyny (or any form of bigotry) states that someone can only be dominant if someone else is subservient.<br><br>The audience in the theatre I was in seemed to feel the same way, because when the narrator said, ""Well, the Kens have to start somewhere. Eventually they'll have as much rights as women have in the real world."" I swear everyone was laughing. It really connected with the audience from what I saw. So many clever points were made in a nonsensical Barbie pink package and it was just perfect. If you made it this far on my review, you're going to have the best day ever today. And tomorrow. And the day after that. And every day from now until forever &lt;3.",10
" ""Babe, listen..""
","What a fascinating movie!<br><br>Personally, I didn't find it narratively satisfying, as it is too weird and surreal (almost like a dream is), as well as dull and disjointed! As it is quite inconsistent with itself.. with the real world being as unrealistic as the fantasy world, and the movie's message clashing from one scene to the next like an idea-soup. Ultimately feels poorly thought out with no real core, aside from ""Patriarchy"".<br><br>There are parts I quite liked (separately from everything else) and the Barbieland sets were impressive! There are also good choreographies, and watching Ryan playing guitar and singing is always a treat. Aside from that, I don't understand the support behind it. But I've heard positive comments from female watchers, and kids enjoying it (while not truly understanding it, and me thinking it isn't really a movie for kids).<br><br>Ruth coming out and flat out saying she invented Barbie was also interesting (for anyone that knows that she basically bought the idea from German creators), but at the end of the day.. I'm not sure what is a ""jab"" and what is really intentional or a homage/tribute or similar to what.",4
" Barbie
","This movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film I feel so seen and acknowledged. I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.<br><br>Unlike what some people might believe it is not ""anti men"" the whole point of Ken's story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous, not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm. In the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person. I don't understand in what world that message is ""anti men"".",10
" hot pink cotton candy mess
","Barbie is a hot pink mess, that ironically sees world in two dimensional black and white. Aside from Margot and Ryan, all the characters are literal one dimensional bimbo.<br><br>Yes, i'm aware of the over the top humour, and almost cartoonish art direction is intentional. Yes, there's supposedly more 'substance' , than the style's portrayed. But the message is so generic, and only on surface level that nothing that hasn't been done before.<br><br>TO BE FAIR, some part of it is actually enjoyable, and i had a few laugh. Margot and Ryan are great, but the rest of the casts is awkard. And the ending is kinda nice. Overall it's ended up being a 'meh' for me.<br><br>5/10

" Easily a 10/10
","This movie is an easy 10/10 for me, did not disappoint. The casting, the directing, the plot, the cinematography, the sets, the detail, the acting, the jokes, it was all perfect. I want to rewatch this movie already! I watched it with my family and it is definitely enjoyable for everyone, the kids might not understand the movie as much but my sibling still really enjoyed it. This movie made me laugh and cry, it focuses on womanhood and mother daughter relationships in both a light hearted and sad way. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie whatsoever, absolutely loved it and recommend.",10
" Ken out of 10
","Barbie exceeds all expectations, delivering a self-aware and meta comedy that appeals to both devoted fans and newcomers. The film's profound layers and sharp humor create an immensely satisfying experience, showcasing the best version of Barbie on a grand scale while embracing its wonderfully weird and unique qualities.<br><br>Margot Robbie's casting as Barbie is spot-on, effortlessly transitioning between the eccentric Barbie Land and the emotionally charged real world. Her performance masterfully captures the character's essence, while her dynamic with Gosling's Ken adds depth and a touching parental undertone.<br><br>Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken is nothing short of phenomenal. It's a note-perfect casting choice that allows him to showcase his impeccable comedic timing, reminiscent of his role in The Nice Guys, but dialed up to a whole new level. His character's journey culminates in a side-splittingly funny musical number.<br><br>Will Ferrell, channeling his Lord Business persona, leads a hilariously caricatured team of executives in Barbie Land. This satire effectively highlights their out-of-touch nature, offering a clever commentary on corporate culture.<br><br>America Ferrara's impactful speech and her heartwarming bond with Ariana Greenblatt contribute a layer of sincerity to the film. This relationship beautifully acknowledges Barbie's history while infusing the narrative with genuine emotion.<br><br>Greta Gerwig's direction shines with a well-deserved bigger budget, evident in the stunning dance sequences, exhilarating car chase, and vibrant Barbie Land. The film's artificial nature paradoxically enhances its visual realism, setting it apart from conventional offerings.<br><br>The soundtrack stands out with a stellar lineup of songs from top-tier artists. These tracks, much like the film itself, range from joyfully fun to deeply meaningful, seamlessly enhancing the overall experience. Barbie's music perfectly complements its narrative, creating a harmonious blend that resonates long after the credits roll.",10
" It's a fun movie, don't over-think it
","I loved the opening sequence of the film and knew it was going to be a fun ride there on out. And it was! It's not ""political"", yes it does talk about the hardships and stereotypes women face, but it's weird that anyone would be upset by that?! The set designs and camp were beyond entertaining and some of the scenes were so out of this world and hilarious. The only reason I don't give it a full ten stars is that I do agree the ending fell a little flat for me, in that I thought everyone in Barbieland would be a little more equal. But, a small miss in an otherwise successful movie. Just go see it!",9
" OVERRATED
","It is a film of absurd humour (which is funny in many moments) that criticises political models, fragile masculinity and society both past and present.<br><br>The approach is to turn current society on its head and make Barbieland a world dominated by women, where they form the elite of society and the Kens are simply their boyfriends, irrelevant, unemployed, kept, objects. Basically what women are in the macho society.<br><br>When Barbie and Ken arrive in the real world, Barbie realises that the world is upside down, that they are the objects and that the world is dominated by men, and Ken discovers the patriarchy and wants to carry it out in Barbieland. So far, the script and the critics are being perfect.<br><br>After a lot of criticism of the hetero-male behaviour of men when it comes to flirting and leaving them to their basic behaviour, the critical moment arrives, the message of the film. The Barbies fight against patriarchy and supposedly don't want to go back to the previous model where they ruled. I say SUPPOSEDLY, because they do go back to that model. One Ken asks the president of Barbieland if they can be part of the courts and the president's answer is, yes, but from below and little by little.<br><br>In the end the Barbies, after discovering the reality of the real world, adopt the same model. They do not accept the Kens as equals, NO, let them gradually integrate. Just as it has happened with women, who are gradually being removed from the wage and work discrimination against women. It was the perfect time to talk about equality, to think about a new model, about evolution. And there is no solution, the barbies continue with the model of today's society. So the film doesn't contribute anything, what is the wonderful message, they just show the path of women and turn it around so that in this case it is the man who is discriminated against. If you make a social and political criticism, you have to propose your own solution. In Barbie there is no solution, the solution is the current system.<br><br>Therefore it is overrated. And on top of not showing the reality of the ""Barbie world"" they show Barbies of all races and sizes, do they sell XXL Barbies? Or Barbies and Ken of all races? They show a diversity that the Barbie universe has never had.",5
" Barbie and Ken have reached the summer box office
",My mom aunts and my sister and my cousin Emily and Maddie grew up with Barbie and Ken for almost their entire childhood to adulthood. After seeing the Barbie movie it made me laugh and see what it's like to grow up with a doll that my sis played with all the time when I was a toddler . I remember my sis having a giant Barbie toy when she was about 4 and she played with her all the time and dressed her with her clothes . But now that Barbie reached theaters my sis and mom realized Barbie is more then just a toy she's the fashion model to all Barbie's from the 60s 70s 80s 90 2000s to now .<br><br>Barbie welcome.,9
" Not for Kids and not what I expected
","This movie is not for kids despite the trailers I saw not showing it may not be for kids. I only saw 1 or two trailers for this movie, and it just looked like a fun movie about barbie in Barbieland and she for some reason goes into the real world. The sub plot of needing to help the girl that is playing with here is just that sub plot the main plot ends up being patriarchy and matriarchy. The sub plot should have been the main plot. The set design was great, the world looked beautiful, the story just sucked. Not all men are pigs or stupid in the real world and I thought they leaned way to hard into this. If they were going to go with this main plot of who is the top dog it should have ended with mainly barbies and 1 ken on council at the very least. I grew up playing with Barbies and I am sorry, but my Barbies always loved their kens. For Barbie to basically hate her ken was just a slap in the face in my opinion. There was not enough Barbieland and too much stupidity.",2
" A shrewd satire?
","Is Barbie a shrewd satire? Despite the existence of two divided factions, in this case, men versus women, which is somewhat comical given that the dispute revolves around whether Barbie's message is ""correct"" or not, the film can be appreciated by both female and male audiences. The work addresses highly delicate themes that are complicated to consider in today's society, as they inevitably generate controversy.<br><br>Nevertheless, the film achieves this with a genuinely humorous approach, inserting clever jokes in moments where the plot becomes dense, interrupting the atmosphere and eliciting laughter from a significant portion of the audience. Personally, while experiencing this situation, I was one of the few gentlemen who attended the screening individually, surrounded by women, and I delighted in the subtly acidic references and humor about current affairs.<br><br>I greatly enjoyed how the film incorporates references to other cinematic classics, such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Godfather,"" two films that are historically revered as some of the best of all time. Moreover, the work addresses contemporary controversies, such as patriarchy, feminism, and the stereotypes imposed on bodies deemed ""perfect.""<br><br>I won't delve into the details of the plot, as it unfolds linearly, as expected in this film. Its development is solid and fitting, focused on a main objective of exposing the marked contrast between our sociocultural reality and a fictional dimension imbued with idealized visions. I must express my surprise at this creation since it was expected that it would merely promote a new collection of Barbie dolls or evoke superficial nostalgia, yet it turned out to be precisely the opposite.<br><br>One aspect that I would like to emphasize is the careful selection of actors, where Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling embody the stereotype of beauty, both female and male, that society deems ""perfect."" Both actors, in their respective roles, present themselves as vulnerable to various challenges inherent to their genders. The film conveys a message that despite possessing a body considered ""perfect"" or conforming to the Barbie stereotypes, it does not negate the possibility of experiencing distress, sadness, fatigue from wearing heels, or confronting the presence of cellulite, ultimately preventing us from being everything we aspire to be. This message intertwines with the reality of women in modern times, addressing the complexities and challenges they face in their daily lives.<br><br>The film fulfills its objective by serving as a critique of society, admittedly leaning towards an unfavorable perspective on the male gender while taking for granted the superiority of the female gender. As a man, I personally was not offended by the jokes directed at the male gender in the film; on the contrary, I appreciated how the film vividly portrays the simplicity, happiness, and lack of complications that we, as men, can achieve.<br><br>Without further ado, adorned with a rosy hue and brief musical moments that do not overwhelm, adding to Barbie's experience, even though it is targeted at a specific audience, it proves to be exceptionally enjoyable. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend it. After all, who wouldn't want to laugh at themselves while acknowledging our human nature, filled with imperfections?",8
" BARBIENHEIMER
","I did not have incredibly high expectations for the lengths that some may have felt this film will go into, maybe because of it being sided with Nolan's Oppenheimer, but you should maybe your readjust your expectations a bit before going into this to enjoy the full experience. What I mean is that there are hints of the graceful indie style of directing Gerwig presented in her previous works, but it is mostly set up as a blockbuster comedy, but one that is still really enjoyable.<br><br>As for the film itself, I think it's a wonderfully fun filmgoing experience, a visually beautiful film with colours that bring you to an ecstatic high. Incredible comedic performance by Gosling lives and breathes the character of Ken and gives it his all, my favourite scene is definitely the musical sequence. Margot Robbie does a great job as well, especially the emotional scenes, although for some reason I feel like she was a bit back-sided throughout the film, I didn't feel like she was leading the audience, but rather being lead herself by the supporting cast, some of which were really underwhelming or uninteresting, or only there for their faces and fame. The problem is that the film does rely a lot on these characters at times, which does not help.<br><br>The major problem with the film for me is that there is a disconnect, there is the film that Warner Brothers and Mattel wanted to make, and there is the obvious talent that is Greta Gerwig. Weirdly, it's become apparent now to me why she has amassed such a huge following, I'll definitely be rewatching Little Women soon. The disconnect that I felt was mostly present in the screenplay, some scenes are incredibly crafted in terms of writing, directing, and acting. While others, especially the Will Ferrell stuff, dragged on for so much and brought down the tempo by a lot, I have already forgotten his role in the film. This imbalance left me a bit confused honestly, there was a good balance of dramatic moments and comedic ones, that was not the issue, but there are entire sequences and scenes, especially in the middle where I felt the quality dropped and the plot was spread very thin at times.<br><br>In terms of production, this is definitely going to strongly compete at the Oscars next year. Production design, costume design, hairstyling and make-up, and cinematography, everything is so lively and gorgeous. I loved how much the film embraced the culture and history of the Barbie toyline.<br><br>All these wonderful technical aspects, great casting, talented directing, and impressive visuals make up for what I thought was a bit of a lacklustre story, one with very obvious themes about feminism and womanhood, which may stir some controversy around the film. For me, I believe it was well-intended for it's target audience. Some of my issues lie not in the content itself but it's execution, as it can come off as a bit too preachy, almost directly laying it out to the audience instead of showing it. It is directly communicating to these young girls about what they are going through, and while Gerwig has heavily touched such subject matter in her previous work more eloquently, it still does what it needs to, tell an inspiring story of self-discovery and reflection using the most popular toyline in the world.<br><br>I believe that this is the best this film could have ever been done. Gerwig does what she is able to do within the constraints of corporate commercialisation and blockbuster filmmaking, to deliver a beautiful, fun, and energetic film with compelling themes that will continue to grow a cult following.",8
" More depth than expected from the previews
","I really liked the movie. Without going into too much detail, I was surprised when I realized the movie was made more for us who played with the Barbies way back in the day. You think it's directed at the younger generations but it actually fits since even my own daughter never wanted nor played with a Barbie. I myself had the entire entourage,(and still have them, almost 40 years later) so it was much more endearing and relatable. I liked the underlying themes, which added depth and perspective that I didn't expect at all. I think that taking very complex and deep topics about societal issues and trying to keep them light is quite often better than delving too deep into these topics . It gives people a chance to think, feel and relate to it, without having the movie become too heavy, or being 'too much'. People that thought it was confusing probably didn't understand that the movie intended to keep it lighthearted for this very reason. I recommend seeing it, especially if you have a Barbie still tucked away on your closet, too.",8
" Very tedious.
","I went in the cinema optimistic as the trailer looks really good, comedy, entertaining. But the trailer shows the only good scenes throughout the whole film, the rest I never had a bloody clue what was happening half the time, The film didn't make any sense what so ever, besides from the first 30 minutes &amp; the dance scene which was very well performed the rest was a catastrophe.<br><br>I have to praise Margot Robbie for her performance, despite the deplorable storyline, her acting was outstanding. On the other hand Ryan Gosling's acting/performance was cheap, cheesy, &amp; overall cringeworthy. A massive shout out to Kate McKinnon her scenes were the hilariously funny, I love her originality.<br><br>Overall not for me, as the storyline is atrociously written &amp; didn't make sense.",2
" I'm Just A Ken
","I have successfully completed Barbenheimer and what a wonderful weekend for cinema it was. Every so often is their polar opposite releases but none ever this big. I saw packed theatres consistently on both days which was an amazing thing to be apart of. It felt very much like the old days of going to the theatres for any movie and the auditorium being absolutely packed!<br><br>Barbie follows stereotypical Barbie as her normal perfect life gets disturbed by something happening in the real world as to which she has to leave Barbie world and fix her life.<br><br>This is the bare bones of the story but Greta Gerwig explores so much more than that. It's obvious the film is highly inspired by films such as Wizard of Oz, La La Land and 2001 space odyssey to name a few. The talent behind the camera is very obvious and this is extremely stylized film. All of the Barbie stuff is top notch and the sets they built feels like something Tim Burton cooked up. Really excellent set design, costumes and props throughout this film.<br><br>I was really worried that this film would spend too much time in the real world and it doesn't. It focuses alot of its story in Barbie World which I really appreciated. Margot Robbie is perfect in the role and continues to showcase her acting chops. Ryan Gosling is amazing too he has the perfect comedic timing and delivery. Perfect casting combo for this role.<br><br>Barbie is a much deeper character exploration and interesting topic point that is very aesthetically shown in this film. No matter what you believe in there is an honest message and I'm sure many girls of all ages will relate to this film on one level or another.",8
" Overrated and poor writing
","The heart of the director and screenwriters was in the right place in wanting to include current issues and acknowledge how diverse and troubled our society is. However, it lacked cohesion. Today's world is certainly patriarchal, but the film's story was vague and filled with too many topics (poorly developed) and platitudes The role of some of the actors, such as Will Ferrell, seemed meaningless to me. The film covered important themes, but wanted to cover too much and yet covered nothing.<br><br>The animation, cinematography and effects are wonderful. But the story falls short.<br><br>I do not recommend it.",2
" Barbie (2023) Greta Gerwig creates a magical world
","Barbie was one of the most anticipated films of the year 2023. Many people made fun of him believing that he would be lame, and other people believed that he could actually be very good because of the cast and direction. Is it rough? In a way yes. But it's deliberately lame, they're living puppets, it's obvious that this is lame. The big complaint about the film is about the critics, as many people found it exaggerated and indeed it is, but again, it's on purpose. The criticism works very well, the characters work, the universe built here is incredible. Visually it is one of the most beautiful films of the year, a world all pink could be very strange, but it turned out beautiful and very convincing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are very good and manage to hold your attention, on the other hand, when they try to focus on other characters, the quality is not the same. Some characters don't work, particularly the businessmen who are featured in real life. Overall, this film is great and has earned its place among the best and most memorable films of 2023.",8
" against the odds its a very good movie, not only for children
","I went into the theatre thinking this is gonna be a little girls movie, about dolls and weird stuff. I thought it was gonna be a boring almost 2h movie about dolls, but oh boy was I wrong.not only was the theatre almost full on the third day of it airing, it was also: funny, inspiring, sad, and at times pretty confusing. It pretty much all felt like a fever dream, but in a good way. It also contained some jokes that were definitely for the adult/young-adult audience, but they were okay for teens like myself and the friend group i went with. Like, Barbie casually drops the word 'vagina' and Ken is talking about his genitals in a non-direct way, but the intention was still there. Some jokes landed pretty flat, but the big majority was very fun. Also the word 'patriarchy' was used way too many times by Ken (Ryan Gosling) and it felt almost annoying. The movie featured songs by the artists: Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and unfortunately Ice Spice. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible, maybe exept Ice Spice's song that was only heard at the credit roll, right at the end. We all know the movie was carried by the amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but I'd say Kate McKinnon's caracter and acting
In conclusion this is a pretty good movie, and if you have the opportunity you should watch it.",10
" Probably the most subversive movie I've seen
","Well, English is not my first language so I'll try my best here.<br><br>With the complete deconstruction of the concept of ""Barbie"", Gerwig subverted every stereotype you've associated with this ""not-so-feminist"" toy. She took an innovative approach to story-telling, struck a balance between flamboyant shots and down-to-earth narrative. Behind every joke there is a harsh reality. It's light-hearted yet solemn, comprehensible yet arduous, optimistic yet depressing. For I know this world is not gonna be as acceptable as the movie wants it to be. Just look at these 1/10 reviews here. I hope Gerwig will make more movies like Barbie because I need it, we need it.",10
" A big mess wrapped up in pink.
","The marketing for this movie was incredible, so are actors and the whole setting. Not only does that attract a massive audience, but also seeing the famous doll many grew up with. Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can not wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can not decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might have been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot.",4
" FuN ( from a Cinematic POV )
","Briefing: 25 , Male , watched alone . Not in any relationship.<br><br>Yo
Greta grewig, you joyous beauty! You are an absolute gem . I ll try watching your movies ( directed/acted ) . All the cast members, visuals, musicals , themes , costume design, choreography aside , let me just write about the story . The actual plot which progresses.<br><br>There are some fairly thought subjective criticism too but they are minimum, completely avoidable.<br><br>Here we see a doll living her best life . The opening invites you like a Disney animated movie when Disney was at their peak ! Like late 2010 or 11 ; The way Men toys are shown is literally cringe worthy (*cries.. cuz that's desperate)
but isn't it the whole point ?! Every thing happens real smooth cha cha , then one day our Lady falls in her existential draid...<br><br>This existential draid has been a recurring theme in many classics. From Taxi Driver to Sopranos ( two heavily Male centric fictional stories ) &amp; in many Arthouse directors life long theme ; from Andrei Tarkovsky to Ingmar Bergmann.<br><br>I was literally awestruck to find such a theme in this movie<br><br>.<br><br>.
.<br><br>.
But,
Everything afterwards is completely different than how typical existential draidy movies handles its story progression.<br><br>Barbie decides to go to real world with Ken . A Ken which literally has no purpose in his life discovers adventure, PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY &amp; gets deviated from his actual purpose. Here the humour elements are so heart touching that you ll feel your childhood fantasy in real life . From a Male POV , This is nothing less than seeing Transformers/Terminator /Avengers/ G I. Joe for the first time in live action . See its definitely understandable how girls are going to perceive this .<br><br>But make it even more enjoyable cause the humour element are so true! ( Both Barbie &amp; ken getting sacked by cops! )<br><br>The horror
The certain realisation hits Barbie when she witnesses how or where the world is heading towards, How ken discovers Patrichy and leaves Barbie in the real world to invent kendom in Barbieland!<br><br>Everything at this point goes downhill until she meets a woman who make her see the way . Not the Granny , no ..
The mother who is still a child within her Heart .<br><br>America Ferrera<br><br>Apparently more than Barbie, Miss Ferrera 's character is made like an Angel. She helps Barbie by solving every little bit of her issues , healthy advices &amp; that with a great masterplan. So simple yet so Damn effective! Go watch it , m not writing every detail!<br><br>The transformation :
We see Barbie showing a lot of emotions while staying true to her emotions. She experiences Anger , sadness, stubbornness, yet she stays kind . She listens to her Human domain , believes in her actions, doubtful but always stays optimistic.<br><br>&amp; I THINK THIS WORLD HASN'T GOT WOMEN LIKE THIS ANYMORE.<br><br>Women nowdays are getting Cold , distant &amp; are accepting Masculine traits desperatly to fight male egos thus destroying their Charisma, personality &amp; Charm . See at the end , the journey comes to an end when a doll becomes human . That transformation, comes through 1) confusion , 2) anger issues (when ken forces himself to join barbie while accessing the human world) , 3) denial (barbie getting into mettel corp.) , 4 ) pain (Barbie meeting that human girl who calls her a capitalist/fascist , 5) agreement (planning to take over barbieland) &amp; 6) still having complete understanding &amp; empathy towards Ken . Saving ken when he breaks down &amp; accepts KENS' defeat . Not even once , not even for once Barbie shows any type of Pride / jealousy / resentment.<br><br>That makes her even more than a human.<br><br>The ending , thats why feels perfect!<br><br>She getting transformed into a human through such an interesting journey feels poignant. Not forced , not sketchy , not masculine but entirely simple , vivid &amp; full of feminine traits.<br><br>Sexism works both ways . (First Barbie getting annoyed over Ken's desperation &amp; later Ken taking over the Barbieland) This movie just shows if both Men &amp; Women listen to eachother &amp; work for their inner souls they can let go of their respective personal bad blood &amp; stupid patriarchal things which has been a stigmata of this giant world. Gone are the days when Women only used to do household works &amp; Nursery cause there is no World War Anymore
So now its time to completely bury that stupid mentality.<br><br>Ken realises it later like all men do
&amp; I think Greta could have given him a better ending than making him wear a shirt which says "" i am kenough "" hilarious yet a bit lacky. -1 for that .<br><br>And yes those childlike Bollywood songs , -1 for that.<br><br>Still a clear W .<br><br>This just shows if a doll can make right choices &amp; becomes a human
A human female, if she chooses the right paths can become much more than just a woman. Lovely film . Great experience!<br><br>Certified Kino stuff.",8

Margot also amazing .<br><br>They tried to be unpredictable, but they failed because there was at the end literally no point.<br><br>I didn't understand the whole Ken tragedy. It was way too much.<br><br>The feminist story was way too old, i mean women have passed these points and criticism. We are not fighting for how our body should be look anymore. The fight is bigger than that. The movie was way too superficial. The first half hour was amazing tho.",5
" One of a kind movie
","Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for ""kids"" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor. The female empowerment that Greta Gerwig presents to us is relentless, showing various situations in which women find themselves involved on a daily basis, as well as various cliches that surround them.<br><br>On the other hand, there is Ken who at first finds patriarchy as the best solution for society, but finally realizes that the role of women is extremely important and that without them society would collapse.<br><br>The way in which Barbie has been shot is impressive, the mixture of the use of animated elements with life action makes seeing Barbie on the big screen a unique experience. I loved the duo of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, they have coexisted perfectly in Barbieland, making watching them act extremely entertaining.<br><br>Without a doubt, this movie is one of a kind and I would like it to be valued for what it really is and not be forgotten like the movie about Barbie.",9
" I don't think I've seen a movie that was more emotional
","Yes, it was funny. That's all I thought it was. But, I'm 7 months pregnant with my first child, a girl, and I couldn't stop crying through ANYTHING remotely touching. It was wonderful. Not too political. Just really thoughtful and sweet. Yes, it was over the top, but in a good way. Barbie and the Barbie/universe did a good job of making fun of itself, I recognized so many Barbies that I used to play with as a little girl, and I felt the feeling over again watching this movie that one gets when they start to grow up and grow out of playing with their Barbies. If you've seen Toy Story 2, it's a similar feeling to that ""when she loved me"" moment. But then there are more heartfelt moments beyond that.",10
" Funny, visually appealing, and smart
","This movie deserves all the praise and the awards it'll surely win! I couldn't stop laughing. It's full of smart jokes, touching moments, and has one of the best sets I've ever seen in a film. Highly highly recommend. It has a wonderful message for both men and women. I hope the success of this movie leads to more films directed by, starring, and made for women. Hollywood has spent far too long catering to men, I see a cultural shift in the next few years. Women want good movies too, with strong, well developed, independent female characters that don't rely on men to interact with one another. Looking forward to more movies like Barbie.",10
" One dimensional characters limit this film from reaching its potential
","I was really excited to see Barbie, but sadly the film came up short for me.<br><br>On the positive side of things, the film has plenty of creativity and the idea of recreating the doll's actual world was a cool one (no stairs, no liquid in cups, feet permanently on tip toes, etc). Margot Robbie was excellent as always. Cudos to Mattel for their willingness to sign off on a film that depicts their company in such a negative light. That isn't something you commonly see.<br><br>On the negative side of things, the plot felt a bit like a rehash of the dozen or so other films I've seen that feature a ""two worlds colliding theme."" A lot of the silly ideas I was expecting to find funny (the beach off) fell flat for me and seemed to rely more on just saying the same joke over and over, rather than using it in a creative way.<br><br>The film's messages about the crushing weight of society's expectations on women and the uneven distribution of power/respect felt hamstrung by the lack of depth in the characters. Ken (Gosling) comes off as an idiot for the entire film and the CEO of Mattel feels more like a cartoon villain than a real person. In the end, the barbies don't aim to create a more just society, but are content instead to simply replicate problematic structures in the opposite direction. The film ends with little to no character development, no one seems to have learned anything by the end of the film. The patriarchy, which this film centers around, is reduced in places to drinking brewskies, horses, and brainwashing. Those kind of reductions make it hard to appreciate the social message that the film portrays and sells the audience's intelligence short.<br><br>Part of the problem for me, I think, is I am unsure of who the target audience for this film is meant to be. If this is meant for children, the simplistic characters and over the top messaging might make sense but the themes and jokes feel a bit dark and too adult for them. If this is meant for adults, the characters lack the nuance that Gerwig was able to show in some of her other work (Ladybird).<br><br>In the end, there are a few fun moments in this film, but the films heavy handed messaging mixed with the lack of depth/nuance in characters means it doesn't hit nearly as hard as it probably should have.",4
" Best movie ever!
","Didn't watch the trailer and went to see the Barbie movie, thinking it would be a regular comedy about a doll. I liked the idea of dressing up in pink with my daughter and going to a girly movie. But I was very surprised when I found out that there was a deep meaning hidden in the pink world of Barbie Land! The movie touches on women's issues: being always perfect, managing everything, being beautiful, perfect mothers, cooks, careerists and wives. The movie also shows men who don't know who they are without their women, cars, jobs. I cried, I was moved by the dialogues. I loved the movie! I was especially impressed by the moment at the bus stop, when Barbie sat next to an old lady and praised her for her beauty. The old lady smiled and said: I know :) It was so cute and wise! It made me realize that growing old is not scary if you love yourself as you are. You don't need to chase youth, there is beauty and dignity in every age. I am grateful to the directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach for making the Barbie movie not only a fun comedy, but also a deep drama about finding yourself and your place in the world. They showed that Barbie is not just a doll, but a heroine who can be anyone and do anything. They also honored the memory of Ruth Handler, who gave millions of girls the opportunity to dream and strive for the best. I think that the Barbie movie is not only a movie for children, but also for adults who want to go back to their roots and find their inner beauty. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Barbie or just wants to watch a good movie with an important message.",10
" A lil of nothing, plastic plastic plastic
","As must of recent movies and series, it was a mix of many important subjects and thesis but didn't go through. All were touched superficially (Barbie) and forzed... dont understand how it has such a high rate here... really?<br><br>The only thing I believe was ejecuten flawless was the movie set, the outfits, and the choreography. Otherwise, I dont thing it concluded any subjects or even really their true point of view. Was just a mix of social ""nowadays must talk"" without any sense or logic or concluded point of view from the characters or writters. Also tryed to be funny and touching, but didnt accomplished... just nonsense...",1
" Fun Heartfelt Romp
","I have not laughed so hard at a movie in such a lot time. There are so many tropes and explorations of what it means to be both genders, and they all just nail it. Could it have hidden the message more clearly? Probably, but then it would be a different movie.<br><br>America, Margot, and Ryan all give amazing performances and they are backed with a fantastic supporting cast!<br><br>The characters are great, it's done well, it's acted well, the set and costumes are beautiful, and the play with Barbie and the real world is fantastic. Cannot wait to see it again, likely in theaters and then buying it when out!",9
" Wow, people reviewed this wrong! Especially when it comes to Ken!
","Seen this as a birthday present with my mom and sister. My birthday was on the 21st, but I ended up seeing the Barbie movie on the 22nd - Joan jett's birthday, wearing my Joan Jett necklace that I had received as a birthday gift, along with my Joan Jett slash Barbie inspired outfit. So, this will go down in history as a very special movie outing for me. I felt like I was going to the actual premiere!<br><br>Weird Barbie was my fave! Kate McKinnon is so attractive!! And even though they say that she was based on David Bowie, I saw a lot of Phyllis Diller in her! Yay for Weird Barbie! My other favorite character was the Barbie creator played by Rhea Perlman.<br><br>Wanted to slap the kid for most of the film for being so rude to her mother and just so grumpy in general, and I felt bad for Ken. I expected that he was going to be an actual villain, but he wasn't. Based on the reviews I read and the criticisms that people had of this movie, I was expecting a really bad guy, but he was just a hurt guy. Ken just wanted as much love as Barbie had, and isn't that understandable? I really felt for him. And I like that I felt for him, because I would rather that than to hate him, the way a lot of the reviewers seem to.<br><br>I adored the musical numbers! I adored the colors! And this movie was a lot more emotional than I expected. It actually made me start to cry! I was surprised.<br><br>I didn't like that Barbie kept pushing Ken away though, saying that she wasn't in love with him. That's just completely against everything that the Barbie can relationship stands for - the fact is, he's her boyfriend, and eventually they do get married! I mean look at any Barbie coloring book from the '90s, and before. This whole Barbie doesn't need ken, that's just some new made up thing. She's always loved Ken and he's always loved her - that's one of the reasons why they are considered an ideal couple. So, I didn't like that part, nor did I like the part of the little girls basically beating up their baby dolls. I thought that was so crass and sad a sight. The idea that they were trying to convey could have been conveyed in a much nicer manner. But overall, a very good movie. Well done! Well done!<br><br>Oh, and I almost forgot, Helen Mirren as the narrator! How wonderful a choice!!",8
" Great comedy that makes some strong points
","Barbie was so much better than I expected it to be, I thought it would be fun but it definitely nailed everything it went for.<br><br>While not taking itself seriously as a comedy, it still manages to touch on important topics like inequality. It holds up a mirror that will make some people feel uncomfortable, and this can be seen by some reviews calling it ""preachy"".<br><br>The performances were so perfect for their respective characters and they did a good job of establishing everyone's role in the story. The story itself had great pacing and kept you interested the whole way throughout.<br><br>The great thing about Barbie is that it touches on worlds dominated by either Men or Women are both wrong, and the key is finding balance and equality. The Barbie showing opposite sides of the real world.<br><br>It also had great positive masculinity, especially during the Ken fight, they could have just gone for a generic case of them fighting each others and looking like they can't control themselves. Instead they had them overcome their differences and appreciate each other.<br><br>I also appreciate they gave Ken a good ending too, having his character not be defined by being with Barbie, and instead being proud of just being himself. Which again, parallels the pressure on Women being defined by their partner.<br><br>A certain crowd won't understand any of the points made by this movie and will just call it ""preachy"" some reviews I've read on here have definitely not watched the movie.<br><br>It's a fun comedy that will make you laugh and also think, overall a great experience and will likely be the film of the year.",9
" Folly of the Dolls
","The hype, enthusiasm, technology, acting skills, not to mention the iconic doll that promised a fantastic movie does not live up, sorry to say, to the incredibly inane writing of this film.<br><br>I was totally with it at the intro though, with the 2001 ""Space Odyssey"" score and the portrayal of a new concept - a doll that does not need nurturing. I thought this is gonna be great. Even in the first 15 minutes of being exposed to modern movie fantasy sets I still had good expectations, especially since Margot Robbie is so talented. It did not take long, however, for things to fall apart.<br><br>The corny dialogue falls flat. Jokes are not funny (unless you are perhaps a fan of American corny slapstick humor). It is not witty either and one has to wonder which age group the writers are aiming for throughout the entire film. I can't imagine a 13 year-old (let alone younger kids with their parents) understanding what is going on in this convoluted sex roll obsessed story that consists of such foolish, not to mention allusive dialogue. If this film was for adults, then that is even more appalling. The aforementioned faults are only part of the problem.<br><br>The plot, which I deemed pointless, confusing and totally unengaging was only a minor distraction to the supporting characters, which were either braindead or lacking any kind of believability, (except for perhaps the Ruth Handler character). It is one thing for dolls to be brainwashed and then transported back and forth with a simplicity even Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz would find effortlessly trite, but as said before, the ""real life"" characters don't have that justification. You can't really relate to any of them.<br><br>I almost never write reviews, but this film was so bad I could not get the criticism out of my head.<br><br>It is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I gave it a 3 simply because of Margot Robbie and the innovative sets. Otherwise it would have gotten a 1. If you need a Barbie fix, you are much better off with Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"" from 1997.",3
" Tune in for the fun, stay for the heart.
","I don't know if I've ever seen anything quite like Barbie, which is rewarding if you ask me, especially since I haven't been this excited for any other release this year. So what did I think of it?<br><br>For starters, I really admire the production of this movie. Gorgeous does not begin to describe the sets, and it's commendable how well they highlight the surrealism of Barbieland. I had seen a YouTube video exploring Barbie's Dreamhouse and already concluded in my mind that it was pretty great, but seeing it in the context of the movie just made it better. The costumes are great too.<br><br>Furthermore, the acting is alright! Huge props to Margot Robbie. The movie blends humour and angst with some other tonal elements, which means that it demands more from the actors than you would assume at first. The ensemble cast was obviously up to the task, but something in their performances caught my attention. I vaguely remember Gerwig mentioning in an interview the issue of considering the technicalities of a typical Barbie's movements. You can notice several points in the movie where the actors embrace the stiff and wooden movements of a doll, but at other less noticeable or relevant moments, they're as flexible as a living entity whilst in Barbieland. I don't know how one would navigate a perfectly adequate balance between the two, but my brain couldn't ignore this mild inconsistency, whether you consider it important or not (and I do). The film did utilize this for comedic effect though, and I thought that was a nice touch.<br><br>While there are more things I like than dislike about this movie, I feel like the execution leaves something to be desired. The first act of the movie is everything I'd hoped it would be; campy, funny, and exceedingly pink. I love that even the subsequent scenes in Barbieland embrace this quirkiness, irrespective of the stakes. However, the transition from Barbie and Co's everyday shenanigans to her journey of awareness and self-discovery felt a bit... sudden? While it aptly gives focus to the main conflict of the movie, I feel like the heavy marketing of the movie had already given away too many glimpses of Barbieland before I saw the film. It took away the element of wonder and left the superficial part of me a little disappointed. Also, the final two-thirds of the movie is just shy of overstimulating. I hate to say it, but the reinforcement of women empowerment ideals isn't done tastefully and comes off harsher than it should, and the sharp tonal change preceding it doesn't help. The exploration of switched gender roles from Barbieland to the real world was another clever idea whose execution lacked finesse. This made Ryan Gosling's Ken briefly unlikeable to me; he saved the performance with his undeniable charisma and sense of humour. And even though I thought the ending was a nice surprise (that scene with the Billie Eilish number is one of the most beautiful things ever), I was sadly distracted by the non-subtlety of the preceding events, however funny or thoughtful they were. Perhaps I would appreciate it better with a second watch.<br><br>So yeah, Barbie is an experience. Tune in for the colourful heaps of fun, and stay for the emotional and humanistic themes. But beware of the untidy edges.",8
" Why did I waste my time?
","This movie was a massive let down. It was never really funny and just kept pushing political issues in my face. I don't care about politics when I'm watching a movie, and I expect a well written story. This film is just bad, and I was actually interested in it. I had high expectations for this film and I think it did not deliver. It's not a valid social commentary because it does not prove there even is a patriarchy and give an example in real life. Actions speak louder than words and this movie is so overrated that I created an account just to leave a bad review. What did I even see in this film? It's a BARBIE MOVIE.",3
" if you're mad you missed the point
","This movie was so absurd and so fun! I laughed so hard my face hurt. I see people feeling like this movie concluded that women are better than men, but the lesson was to celebrate womanhood in all its forms, with the overarching message for everyone being to find who you are on your own. Barbie told ken he should stand in his own light and find out who he is outside of his relationship with her! He's kEnough!!! I think because this was such a big budget and highly publicized movie, people don't super know who greta gerwig is and how her past movies have really celebrated womanhood through all its phases, especially the messy parts. It was so fantastic and so nuanced and self aware, i'm grateful this movie exists! P.s. If ur mad that the barbies didn't give the kens true parity and just threw some lower level judge position at them, then wait until you find about what the supreme court in the real world does!!!!",10
" Layered, Bold, Smart, and most importantly, Funny
","Barbie is a fantastic movie, it's so layered, bold and smart. Brilliant writing, directing, acting, costumes and set design wow. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are amazing in it. Also America Ferrera, what a performance (her monologue in one scene has us gagged in the cinema).<br><br>Greta Gerwig created a clever, charming and fun movie that will have you laugh, smile and clap. It will also have you thinking about our individual role and place in the world. A breath of fresh air in the world of cinema and one that is needed for these challenging times we're in.<br><br>Margot Robbie as Barbie was like she was born to play the role. But still, imo Ken(played by literally me) stole the show.<br><br>A solid 8.",8
" Barbie is a great and funny movie!
","Film Barbie was directed by Greta Gerwig. It stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. The film is set in Barbie Land and Real World. It was filmed mostly in UK. The story starts in our time in Barbie Land. One day her feet are getting flat and she goes to Weird Barbie for advice,she sends her to the Real World. Ken hides in the car and goes with Barbie. There Barbie founds out very upset things,but Ken the exact opposite. He brings his knowledge of patriarchy into Barbie land and everything goes upside down. In the end Barbies and Alan save Barbie Land.<br><br>I strongly recommend Barbie. It shows very important things ,has wonderful soundtracks. I really loved this film.",10
" Who is this movie for?
","When we saw the trailer for this movie I knew that my wife was going to want to see it. I really wanted this to be a fun movie and figured it would poke fun at itself a bit. Ryan Gossling and Morton Robbie did a great job as actors. But they were not given a cohesive script and story line. This movie was all over the place. It was not fun and it never is when you are watching overlong dialog, songs, and dance routines. I'm not sure I can even explain the main storyline of this movie. Is that Barbie wants to be real? Does she want to help the girl, now woman that used to play with her fix the relationship with her daughter. Was it about Ken not wanting to exist as an accessory? Overall, this was not fun, funny and ended up being tedious and actually boring. This is not a movie for little girls and it is not a movie for adults either. This is a really big missed opportunity.",3
" Literally the best movie ever
","It truly surprises me how greta gerwig revolutionizes the film industry, with a movie that's seemingly so simple and ""childlike"" and turning it into a life lesson and still keeping the fun in it. It has so many fun elements in it but still gives off its message so clearly. How well it was filmed and directed was truly astounding to see how it was not only visually beautiful and aesthetically pleasing but also the writing and the acting. Every part of this movie was well thought out and it shows. My only critique is that the pace at the ending was a bit too fast and random but it ultimately makes sense in the movie so it's excusable.",10
" Deeply flawed core
","Ambitious mess, its not a polished jewel without flaws.<br><br>Can see this having true potential and understand people admiring the fearlessness more then the result and giving it a 10.<br><br>Think you can go watch this if you expect it to be a 5/10 that is flawed and with a good mood you can still enjoy the experience. Go to it expecting a 10 and think your doomed.<br><br>There is certainly things in this movie to enjoy indeed think it has to many ingredient. The acting of Ken and Barbie are great ironical they get to show off their range by literally barbie/ken.<br><br>This site really need to lower the minimum review number of words as could have certainly made the same point with half the words, given the option.",5
" 7.5, fun movie, but lacks depth
","I enjoyed this movie a lot, but there were also some parts in the storyline that didn't make sense or lacked depth.<br><br>First off the things I enjoyed:
The decor and colors were amazing, the music was great, the casting was incredible, weird barbie, Allan, the way barbie and Ken were completely unaware of how the world worked when they first got there, kens song, the fragments of life that barbie saw at the end.<br><br>Even though many parts were good, there are parts that just lacked sense.<br><br>The movie tries to make sort of a statement of mother daughter relationships, which kind of works but just not quite. The daughter character doesn't contribute much to the story, she's really just that one grumpy teenage character who turns out to have a heart after all, but it just didn't make sense in the story. Next the entire corporation storyline didn't make sense at all. In the beginning it was like fine, they try to get barbie back to barbieland, but then she goes back herself, they follow her and from that point they contribute literally nothing to the story anymore. I forgot they were there until they suddenly appeared out of the bushes. It just lacked depth and logic and in my opinion it just wasn't necessary to have made the movie to what it was.<br><br>Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie a lot, but some plot points just weren't what I expected them to be. Still, I would recommend this movie to a friend.",8
" New concept
","Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought ""how did they even come up with all of this"". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It's very extravagant and light and fun. It's not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.<br><br>In one word: iconic.",10
" Let's Go Party With Barbie
","Welcome back, Streamers! The most anticipated movie weekend of 2023 is here. It's Barbenheimer. If you haven't followed it, there's this ridiculous internet debate over which film will reign supreme between Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer...<br><br>In this corner, coming in at 11.5 inches, it's the iconic, blonde fashion doll, Barbie.<br><br>Barbie is the first live-action film about the American icon and her place in culture. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote a screenplay, which Gerwig directs, that takes audiences into Barbieland, where we meet stereotypical Barbie (Marot Robbie) and her fellow Barbies living their perfect existences until one day stereotypical Barbie starts to think constantly about death, her feet become flat and other things are off. Barbie has to make a trek to the real world to find out why things have changed for her and to set them straight. Barbie is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), whose existence is so dependent upon Barbie that he only has a good day if Barbie looks at him. Rollerblading, hot pink singing and dancing hijinks ensue.<br><br>Overall, Barbie is a weird and wonderful movie. It is clear that a lot of thought and money went into creating this story and world inhabited by Barbie. You will be awed by the clever production design and the intense attention to detail that went into constructing Barbieland. The colors pop. There are cute animated touches throughout. Additionally, the costume design enhances each Barbie and Ken in interesting ways. You'll also notice the music throughout the film is sometimes poignant and sometimes hilarious, especially when it involves the Kens. From top to bottom, the crafts in this movie are top notch and worthy of a trip to the big screen.<br><br>The cast, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are excellent. Robbie brings sensitivity and heart to Barbie. She's thoughtful and kind while also being naive and troubled by her own existence. It is a tricky performance to pull off and Robbie is great. Ken is an iconic performance for Gosling. He pulls out all of the stops to bring Ken to life. I can't imagine another actor being as successful in this role. Gosling is a really gifted comedic actor as evidenced by this performance. I'll also note that Kate McKinnon, American Ferrar, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Michael Cera and Issa Rae each have good moments as well. It's a big cast, but some of the smaller roles do get chances to shine.<br><br>The main issue is that the messaging is so heavy-handed. There is a lot to unpack about Barbie's place in society. What does she represent to women and girls? What does she represent to men? There are themes of feminism, patriarchy, and corporate greed. The film does its best to address its issues in a clever and subversive way, but it veers into becoming patronizing at times rather than funny and satirical. The performances of the actors really carry the film across the finish line despite how it handles its themes.<br><br>Ultimately, Barbie is a movie worthy of a trip to the theater. It is funny and even clever at times. The messaging of the movie gets heavy-handed and some of the subversive fun is lost in those moments. Nevertheless, Gosling and Robbie fully commit to their characters as does the large ensemble; and the production design and music are top notch. You won't be disappointed with a big box of popcorn. You decide if you want to wear hot pink like everyone else.",8
" Thanks, no!
","The most unpleasant and disappointing film that has come out recently! To be honest, I was waiting for this movie! Because of Gosling and Robbie! I waited in vain. Boring plot, bad music (there's not even Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"" song), poor acting and general atmosphere of the film. And even though it is the highest-grossing film of the year, I didn't like it, like many others. Oppenheimer turned out to be much better, and thanks to him for that! I do not recommend this film under any circumstances. Never. Watch only good movies and don't waste time on mediocre film projects. Good luck to all! Bye!",1
" An absolute feast for your senses - Hollywood is coming of age . Finally.
",The movie that breaks all norms and once again proves that following the norm does not get you anywhere. The emotional roller coaster with a colourful palette is an absolute masterpiece of story telling with strong social messaging. The songs touch the right emotions and at times; the audience were visibly tearful. Barbie represents every one of us . All the characters shine through and the actor and the story is bold. Mattel have proved to be visionary in being bold and addressing the shortcomings of their marketing . This takes a lot of guts. The movie absolutely hammers home the point - representation matters. And there is a Barbie in each one of us.,10
" Worst movie I've seen in 30 years!
","If it were possible to rate this movie a negative 10 I would. Twenty five minutes in, and I was ready to walk out of the theater. It was without a doubt one of the silliest, most stupid movies I have ever seen in my life. It finally got a little better 30 minutes in, which brought it up to a negative three. Want an extreme waste of the talents of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. How did anyone ever convince them to star in this pink train wreck of a movie? Newsflash to Margo and Ryan, you're only as popular as your last movie! Lots of careers have gone into the toilet after a lousy movie like this one!",1
" Greta Gerwig Makes A Perfect Movie
","I went into Wednesday expecting to write things like ""the greatest weekend in cinema"", ""Oppenheimer brings cinema to the screen again"", ""Barbie wins the weekend""... But this is so much more than that.<br><br>Barbie was perfect. It shows something that I was able to experience for the first time in my life: the artistic pleasure of movies as a communal and cultural experience. Although watching Titanic was one of the greatest communal experiences of my life, it's the immediate cultural relevance of Barbie that makes it a first for me. It's the best that movies can be. And above all else, in six years time this might be looked back upon as one of the best movies of the decade.<br><br>In the consumerist world's perfect fantasy sold to little girls as a toy-the polished plastic world of Barbie-everything is perfect. Starting with Barbie herself. Until the doll experiences something all too common to the real world but inexplicably strange to hers: an inexplicable desire to die. We get acquainted with the situation following a musical set-piece opening of the kind that tells you you're in for a great ride! (A pleasure made double for any Dua Lipa fan!)<br><br>As it turns out, someone in the real world (Gloria (America Ferrera) a woman working an office job at Mattel) has communicated these emotions to her. It's now up to Barbie to travel to the real world to repair the rift in the space-time continuum. Her typical but good guy boyfriend Ken joins in for the ride.<br><br>In the sweet and softhearted comedy that follows, Ken and Barbie make their first encounter with the real world, where Barbie finds out she's only ever sexualized, and Ken is treated with a newly discovered respect that he never knew in the Barbie world. Gradually, he discovers the patriarchy. When Barbie finally meets Gloria and her teenage daughter (beautifully cast and great showing from young Ariana Greenblatt) after they help her escape a chase with the corporate goons at Mattel that preside upon the cubical empire, the journey is done and they happily return to Barbieland. Only there's one problem: Ken has brought the patriarchy back home!<br><br>With the visual representations of masculinity in popular culture (pretty much Rocky Balboa), outrageous rocker outfits, and a great fancy of horses (I share this with Ken I have to say), Ken has now amassed all the aesthetics he needs to firmly establish the rule of the patriarchy in Barbieland. The comedy is bafflingly funny, and the subject is urgently topical.<br><br>I've lately had the feeling that movies today weren't as important as they used to, that they didn't mean as much and like Quentin Tarantino said and I agree, ""they're not in the zeitgeist (the spirit of the age)."" This movie was right in the zeitgeist!<br><br>It's thanks to a collaboration between Warner Brothers, Mattel (kudos to them for having the sense of humor), and an artist like Greta Gerwig that we're able to have her take something so deeply established in the pop culture and marry it with the standalone work of an artist and its integrity. The result is something I've never seen in a theater before.<br><br>In a scene where Barbie is experiencing an emotional breakdown, Gloria transitions into a long-running monologue about how it was like for her to be a woman in today's world. I sat and watched and thought it might had been something a bit clichéd and worn out. Everyone had settled into silence. Then the moment Gloria was done with the monologue, there was a pause, with her and with the audience, then the whole room erupted into applause! I joined right in! What the hell did I know... When the movie kept getting more and more exciting, and just transitioned into a modern-day musical set-piece this time around, people were so with it they had to applaud again. It was a truly great thing to see. (US audiences and people in Marvel movies are known to cheer for many things, but this was a different degree of sincerity.) At the end of it there was a buzz in the room, like everyone had just been part of something special.<br><br>Essentially you know it's a great situation, you have no idea where the movie might go next, and it keeps coming up with the right answer every single time. It's perfect.<br><br>More props to Greta; like all the truly great movies, it's also very personal. At first it's personal in the relevant but quirky mention of Rocky Balboa and The Godfather as symbols of the male-revolving world-movies that she herself wanting to be a filmmaker had had to deal with as deeply cherished and highly regarded in the masculine opinion around her-and it's personal again in the ending, and what she sees as most cherishable about being human, in what will stay with me as one of the classic shots of all time. The shot comes with Margot Robbie's perfecting of the single-eyed tear and using it the way you imagine they would in the great old times of cinema, except it's that much better because the times are today.<br><br>I've seen reviews (The Guardian) calling this a feminist thesis. It's neither a thesis (see Women Talking) nor a dogma. It's entirely cultural. And despite the story largely being a comedy about women banding together and helping each other break free of the omnipotent clamps of the patriarchy, Ken, who is an absolute joy in this movie, is treated to a delicate ending as well. The role was also a total gift of a role and Ryan Gosling was right there for it.<br><br>It's also the movie's quality as a journey of spiritual discovery, confrontation, and self-actualization, along with the great tradition of the Hollywood ending, that bring everything together and make this a proper pop culture opus.<br><br>As far as what this implies for the industry, this is the first time that we'll be able to have a strongly established director that isn't one of the folks who made their name in the 90s. This is not to say that Greta Gerwig is now going to make a Barbie every other year, nor does she have to. This is her Pulp Fiction, her Raiders of the Lost Ark, and dare I say her Godfather (wink wink). May she enjoy it. But she's definitely on my short list now of the most exciting directors working today, and someone that can carry the torch of great cinema wherever she goes next. I remember hearing her answer with Singin' in the Rain (1952) to a favorite movie question in a roundtable interview, and thinking who was this girl. Then I happened to see Singin' in the Rain a month later, and I knew that girl was cool.<br><br>Finally, I'm glad that an entire generation of young girls gets to grow up with a movie like this available to them. It's definitely not something Greta's generation had, not quite. It's also a culmination of the last ten years of popular culture, which is why I think it's one of the best movies of this period. But it's also gonna be remembered and talked about for decades to come. And based on its feminist scope, it might be already one of the most important movies of the 21st century.",10
" Barbenheimer.
","After having seen Oppenheimer (also reviewed) in 35MM and IMAX 70MM, I decided it was time to view the other half of Barbenheimer. With my local cinema usually being quiet, and the film having been out for weeks, I was happy to find that the screening of Barbie was almost sold out when I got one of the few tickets left, leading to me entering Barbie's world.<br><br>View on the film:<br><br>Welcoming the audience to Barbie's world (life in plastic, it's fantastic) with a crane shot landing in Barbie's Dreamhouse, ( with the shot fully displaying the amazing production design) co-writer (with her husband Noah Baumbach) / directing auteur Greta Gerwig &amp; The Homesman (2014-also reviewed) cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto unbox a tantalizing fantastical atmosphere shining in a kaleidoscope of pinks and Jacques Demy- inspired bursting primary colours.<br><br>Gliding across Barbieland to sparkling Musical numbers from toe-tapping tunes by Andrew Wyatt and Mark Ronson, Gerwig plays with in the land with an opening tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which merrily sets the stage for ultra-stylized paper cut montages, casting the real world in muted, grounded colours, and shimmering close-ups of Barbie dancing off with Ken.<br><br>Bringing all his Kenergy to the role,Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as Ken, with Gosling visibly enjoying expressing Ken's lack of self-awareness as he attempts to woo Barbie with one-liners that are left hanging in the air, whilst Michael Cera gives an adorable, awkward turn as Allan, and Will Ferrell displays (some) restrain from his now typical shouting manner, with an amusing boo-hiss turn as the Mattel CEO.<br><br>Revealing in an interview that she said to the studio that because "" now you've got Barbie and Greta Gerwig,"" the film would be certain to make a Billion at the Box Office, Margot Robbie gives a magical performance in the title role, thanks to Robbie performing the dead-pan comedic one-liners in a exuberant manner, and also displaying an enticing, unshakable eagerness, blossoming when Barbie drives away from Barbieland.<br><br>Leaving Barbieland behind for the first time, (leaving the familiar safety net, also being a major theme in Lady Bird) the screenplay by Gerwig and Baumbach splendidly threads very funny fish out of water set-pieces with empowering statements against toxic masculinity and casual sexism, as Barbie runs over every attempt made to force her away from a path of self-discovery, and into a small, marketable little box, by waving farewell to Barbieland.",8
" Let's go Barbie! And Ken is a Ten
","I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint, but I have to say this movie rocks. Margot Robbie is awesome, Gerwig's direction is solid, the writing is well thought out, the colors pop, and let's not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this. His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children. I'm definitely looking forward to see where Gerwig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future.",8
" Fun, colourful and ... mainly for mothers in crisis
","I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I found out it would exist. I turned my whole world pink. And then I was sitting there in the cinema hall, bored. Yes, I did like the pink Barbie Land. Yes, I loved how they portrayed the actors as innocent Barbie/Ken/(Allan) dolls in their childlike fantasy world. But what happened next? Barbie faced depression, thoughts of death, cellulite, and flat feet (actually, I kind of liked how they freaked out because of that lol). Well, okay, fine - this could still turn out great, couldn't it? Barbie and her ""obviously pain in the neck"" Ken, who appeared more relatable to me than Barbie herself, embarked on a playful and lovely journey to the ""real world."" The CEO of Mattel kind of saved that real-world experience for me. Barbie meets a rebellious teen girl and her mother in a crisis and takes them back to Barbie Land, where Ken, who figured out that men can also rule the world, turned the pink glitter style into a ""Kendom."" So far, so good. What happened next was just annoying and confusing. I'm saying this as a 26-year-old woman. There were endless speeches about how hard it is to be a woman and a mother. And when Barbie decided to live as a human - the already known talk about how cruel human life can be. The only refreshing thing was Ken's battle and the song ""I'm just Ken."" The ever-popular Barbie turned out to be an aging woman who just can't get on with her life and treats the only person who is always by her side (her Ken) like trash, which was the worst for me personally. I felt like no one in the full cinema hall laughed at all during that movie. And the people left the cinema confused and silent.",4
" Barbie can be anything!
","This movie wasn't just a plastic fantastic teenage movie, or rather it wasn't at all plastic but rather fantastic, and was actually deep and with a ton of messages and pointers about being a daughter, a mother, a Woman, a human being . I laughed at times, was blown away at times because it really mastered the sparkle and magic of the universe of Barbie, but I was also touched to tears at time- and I left the cinema with a feeling of having seen something important. A thing I actually hadn't expected. This is not just a movie about Barbies, but a movie about starting life with dreams, expectations, innocence, naïveté and how those things just doesn't always match reality- it's about making choices of who we want to be/ not wanting to be. Barbie can be anything (poor Ken is just Ken- a really relatable feeling being a woman living in a man's world)- do we want to be the product or do we want to make an impact of the product?<br><br>Wether you are a daughter or a mother, young or old, watch this movie.<br><br>My daughter said that when she left the cinema she understood something about her mother she hadn't really fully realized before: her mother has also once been a girl moving into womanhood like her self. She had somehow been too busy rebelling that she never thought about that.",9
" All fun and all conflicting
","I'm not gonna pretend that the first bit of the movie didn't make me think of Marklar - the fictional planet that is inhabited by Marklars, who refer to all people, places and things and Marklar. I swear that the energy of Barbie just saying ""Hi Barbie"" or ""Hi Ken"" and specific Barbies or Kens reacting back was pretty much the same. Also, the whole plotline kind of reminded me of Wreck-It Ralph (2012), as the idea that a fictional character must leave his digital/fantasy home has some similar connotations in the storytelling.<br><br>I can say that I had some fun during the movie. I'm not a big fan of comedies but there were genuine moments where I did have a laugh. At the same time, there were a lot of moments where the nature of the comedy just didn't resonate with me well. To be completely honest, if I had done some research prior to watching this movie and had noticed that Will Ferrell was part of the cast, I probably wouldn't even think about watching the movie (long story short - I just cannot stand his style of comedy) but thankfully, on Barbie he wasn't a major character and his presence wasn't half bad.<br><br>Now to address the elephant in the room - as a white male, I've never felt comfortable talking about patriarchy, feminism, genderism, etc. I just feel that, as a man, I'm not in a position to understand the struggles of a woman. I can say I can relate to their problems, but I can't step into their shoes to actually feel them. So, during political media courses when we covered gender studies, sexually and similar topics or when we went through the literature of Judith Butler and similar authors, I was just lost and felt completely incompetent. I still feel lost to some extent. Even though this movie was highly satirical, I still felt uncomfortable that various stereotypes, both of male and female quirks, were presented as signs of weaknesses. Both masculinine and feminine traits (which I'd argue don't ""exist"" outside of discourse) create such an atmosphere where neither men or women can live together without one of them submitting to the other. It was more saddening than funny to see it playout. Both the patriarchy taking control and the women taking the power back segments just felt uncomfortable and even the music tracks didn't make it better for me.<br><br>I mostly went to see the movie out of curiosity as I had hints of there being political underlines and corporative positioning (as in how ideas are sold instead of products, creating a fake sensation of wants and even needs) ideas in a movie that covers the pink Barbie world where life is fantastic. Unfortunately, I felt disappointed in that regard, but the happy vibes did get to me, especially in the first half of the movie, so I can't say my experience with the movie was that bad.",5
" So much fun
","I went and saw this with one of my best friends and it was a quite ride. We laughed, we cried, we had a great time! Barbie was definitely one of the best films we've seen all year! This was relatable on so many levels! I personally felt that there really is something in this movie for everybody! It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well! The entire cast was absolutely incredible in making this film both be true to what Barbie is to little girls and what it did for children growing up!",10
" Pleasantly surprised
","I went to see this movie after hearing all kinds of ""propaganda"" about it so I wasn't sure what to expect. I absolutely loved it! It was hilarious, thought provoking, inspirational, and an all around great movie. Definitely geared towards adults but the jokes that may be mildly inappropriate (and I do mean MILDLY) will go over kids' heads. I loved seeing the character arcs and how each of them grew and changed ultimately for the better by the end of the film. While I was I initially hesitant to go and see it I loved it and would absolutely watch again. I recommend this movie whether you love Barbie or have mixed feelings.",10
" Loved It!
","Barbie is definitely one of the best films to bought out to cinemas this year, or even longer than that. It had us laughing from the start to finish, crying in some moments and scenes so overall it was an emotional rollercoaster. Greta has done a great job and balanced a mix of fun and hard truths about the world we live in today. For people say this isn't worth watching, clearly don't know how to let a film just transport you away into its world for a moment, absolutely brilliant film, I'd pay to go and watch it again. Well done to Greta, Margot, Ryan and all of the cast &amp; crew for a fantastic watch!",10
" Boring and comical (not in a good way)
","I wanted to like this movie but it was just plain silly. Maybe it's meant for pre-teens. I can't believe Margo and Ryan needed the money so bad they accepted these roles. Ive also noticed that Goslin puts way too much make up on and a lot of the shots are animated or touched up digitally to make him look younger. He is 43 yrars old. Thiwcis not the type of role for him. Hollywood really needs to step up when it comes to quality. Barbie movie??? I mean, that's just unnecessary. I can't believe some people here thought it was entertaining. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Avoid at all costs.",3
" Greta Gerwig never misses!
","Watching Greta Gerwig's interpretation of womanhood through universal icon, Barbie, was a beautiful and uniting experience.<br><br>This movie celebrates the transition from girlhood to womanhood, as well as the universal experience of just existing in this day and age.<br><br>Not to mention the filming techniques used to film alongside the soundtrack and even the cast made the movie feel like a trip back to playtime in childhood.<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have so much on screen chemistry that makes the movie feel fluid and fun, and the insanely diverse cast of both Barbies and Kens was an astounding and commendable casting choice.<br><br>Barbie is definitely Oscar worthy, and represents something much more than a doll.",9
" Very bad, but still Watchable.
","Barbie - The 2023 hyped film thats really not so good as the high imdb says. Its not worth its rating at all.<br><br>I cannot really understand the extremely high rating of this film.<br><br>A pretty bad story.<br><br>It's ridiculous exaggerated and is extremely boring. Silly, slow and boring.<br><br>But i truly think it has a good message about importance of feminism and give a good perspective of our true society, so i therefore for my 3/10 rating. But everything else isnt that good.<br><br>Breaking the fourth wall at some moments is smart and really get all what the film is about.<br><br>I think i never has seen a manuscript that is so lame and bad, as in Barbie.<br><br>Ive heard its one of 2023 most popular films. However It really is a film which gets better into it.<br><br>Pretty good ending, but awfully bad last minute.<br><br>To summarise its a pretty bad movie. Wouldn't really recommend, but still watchable.",3
" Best movie of the year!!
","There is literally nothing to not love about this movie. Timing, perfect. Comedy, perfect. Ryan Gosling? Also perfect. Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie or purchase it when it comes out. It's rare to see something that synthesizes nostalgia, the societal journey of growing up (that extends generations) and balances this with comedy. There is a reason this debuted so highly at the box office and I am certain this will solidify itself as a cultural centerpiece for film schools in the future. Not only does it highlight long existing issues that half of the population has to endure, it does so in a way that you feel seen and can see others.",10
" Surpassed My Expectations
","I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!",10
" Stellar
","I absolutely adored this movie, without spoilers I can say it's truly fun and surprisingly a lot deeper than you would initially think going into it. Beyond that I thought the cinematography was fantastic and the color palette was perfect, and above all else the acting was amazing from everyone in it! Especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, I know people were hesitant to accept him as Ken but he really knocks it out of the park, and I honestly cannot believe they considered people other than Margot Robbie to be Barbie. It's like she was BORN for this role. Absolutely adored this movie and I hope no one listens to the review bombing, it really is a treat!!",10
" Overrated barbie
","It's like a women's solidarity movie. It was a production in which all men were shown as 2nd class and this was done through a good cast and a well-established company. It's a totally overrated PR movie. Despite all this, the acting was successful. However, the movie did not meet my expectations. Ryan gosling and margot ronbbie are both good actors, but this scenario limited both of their abilities. In my opinion, product placement and advertisements were also over exaggerated. It was like the longest commercial I've ever seen in my life. I can say that I counted the minutes, especially for the last half hour of the movie to end, it was not a movie worth all this expectation.",3
" She's more than just barbie!
","The barbie movie is AMAZING. Like perfect cast, amazing references. Like Taylor swift level of references and Easter eggs. It's so clear that it's been made by women (or majority women) all departments, everywhere I hope it wins awards. I've never felt this way for a movie before but it defs was hyped up for a reason. It's a barbie movie made for everyone but it's not like a typical barbie movie (which I still love) it's so much more, once I heard Billie eilishes new song I knew it was gonna be GOOD and in depth with its story line and it was. The whole team and makers of this movie hit the nail on the head. It's genuinely become my favourite movie.",10
" NOT family friendly
","This movie is made for adults, not suitable for children. Despite its marketing campaign that could easily be mistaken for a fun, kid-friendly film, it is riddled throughout with adult language, sexuality, and mature themes. It's a surprisingly unrelenting work of misandry, toxic relationships, and alternative lifestyles coated in the pink plastic shell of a beloved toy. At times it's hard to determine whether the message of the film is more about depression, disappointment, or death as the reality of the human condition. It's a clumsy attempt to paint people groups with a broad brush in order to win sympathy points for the main characters.<br><br>The production was great, though. The music was stirring and heartfelt, and the visual presentation of the film was unique and enjoyable. The actors also brought movingly authentic performances. And there were some clever comedic moments that brought at least some relief to the suffocatingly heavy-handed onslaught of toxic messaging. It could've been a great movie.",3
" Absurdist Feminist Masterpiece
","With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think.",10
" what an amazing movie
","More could you want from a movie? How about Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Hari Nef all playing Barbie variations, like Weird Barbie, President Barbie, and Doctor Barbie. Plus, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and Ncuti Gatwa are all playing Kens. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the company who first brought us Barbie and her Dreamhouse. The film focuses on what happens when the perfect doll has an existential crisis, and Mattel's pursuit to stop Barbie from changing the real world forever. Greta Gerwig ('Lady Bird') directs a script she co-wrote with partner and fellow filmmaker Noah Baumbach ('Marriage Story'). Drop by the Dreamhouse in your pink convertible when the movie premieres in July 2023.",10
" Absolutely adored this film....
","I love that this film incorporates comedy and realism into it. I also like the fact that it wasn't entirely about Barbie and woman, but also about men and that they also have feelings and emotions. As a 15 year old girl, this made me think about what its like from my mother perspective in life, and that no matter, what they will always support us in what we want to be or dream to be. Coming out of the theatre, a whirlwind of emotions flooded my mind. Glorias speech made me realise that even though the world and people demand us to be perfect doesn't mean we have to achieve those demands, we need to find ourselves and love ourselves before we love anyone or let anyone love us. I understand that men feel as though Ken deserved a bit of leadership ad power, but the Barbies built that land. Us woman love this movie because it opens up our imagination of what we can be, and though people says "" Oh, they could've let the Ken's have a bit of ownership and power"" But when Barbie went to the real world, you could see from most women's perspective of what their life is like on a daily basis 'not saying all men are like this stereotype'. Barbieland gives young girls the motivation and the idea that they CAN be a president, a construction worker, an astronaut, an they can be weird. I understand that people hav their different opinions, and this is just mine.",9
" mixed bag
","I found this to be a mixed bag.<br><br>First up, when I walked into the cinema I expected there to be lots of young Barbie fans - there weren't more than a handful. The audience was a real cross section. Probably the majority were females - just. People of all ages from a few young girls through to pensioners - with lots in the teeneager to late 20's group. Lots of people wearing pink.<br><br>This is the first time I can remember since Terminator 2 where I couldn't go to the screening time I wanted as it was sold out for my two first choices (in the day time).<br><br>I was expecting a high camp movie that works on both levels - young kids and something for the adults. Thats not really what we got. This is not a kids movie. The group of kids sat near us were visibly bored after the first half an hour. Its a 12A for a reason. There seems to be a perception that this movie is for little girls waving Barbies around - it isn't.<br><br>The first half hour has all the camp stuff, setting the scene, adults acting as dolls, funny Barbie world-isms, etc.<br><br>Then it changes when America Ferrera and her joy-sucking teenage daughter are introduced. It stops being so much fun. The central message of the film is then clumsily hammered home with no subtlety for the rest of the movie - taking the viewer out of Barbie world. Its message is also delivered inconsistently.<br><br>The final joke of the movie does not hit home very well and seemed a bit unnecessary.<br><br>With the above criticisms, heres the mixed bag bit - it was very funny in places. We laughed out loud lots, but seemed to be the only people in the 3/4 full theatre laughing. Its also very clever in places - like the discontinued Barbies.<br><br>Ryan Gosling is excellent. Will Ferrell is hilarious. Michael Cera is good. Others are confusing (Rhea Perlman's character...). I expected more from Ncuti Gatwa - given he is the new Dr Who.<br><br>Some very amusing musical numbers.<br><br>It felt a little long. Would have made a nice 90 minute movie.",5
" Hi Barbie
","If you're expecting a subtle satirical flick, Barbie isn't for you. However, you'll be missing out a quite beautiful and clever movie that talks about womanhood like a few movies do.<br><br>There are vibrant pink tones all around and the sets are truly exquisite and special. Its very distinctive and well-thought-out look place Barbie amongst one of the most original recent summer blockbusters. A big plate of originality and inspired artistry that unfortunately doesn't fully step away from the fact that is still a corporate movie and that is honestly perceptible every time they leave Barbieland.<br><br>Gerwig and Baumbach decide not to go quiet this time. Everything seems a bit too loud and too on the nose. For some it might come across as a ""men are trash"" agenda, but for me I wouldn't have it any other way. There are way too many movies being subtle critiques to our sexist society. Barbie is a movie set for everyone to watch, so why be quiet when there's a lot of people listening to you? Gerwig shouts like she is talking to a billion people. And that's because she really is.<br><br>Margot Robbie was such a great Barbie and was incredibly easy to empathize with her character which proves Robbie's powerful effort. Ryan Gosling was born to play this role and I would love to continue seeing him exploring his goofier side - seriously couldn't stop laughing every time he entered the scene. You can tell everyone had lots of fun doing this movie and how important it was to everyone involved.<br><br>The final montage of this movie not only made me cry, but reminded how beautiful it is to see my mother and my sister happy and enjoying life.<br><br>As flawed as it is I'm so happy a movie like Barbie exists and that people all over the world are rushing to the theaters to watch something as important as this. Congrats to you, Greta, you are an amazing and bright soul.",9

Just exceptionally written characters also. The quirks between Margot Robbie (Barbie) &amp; Ryan Gosling (Ken) are just magic together on screen.<br><br>Margot is probably the only person to have played ""Barbie"" as she is so perfect in the role with everything she does.

It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.",10

In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say.

","Salute to the marketing department for creating a buzz like no other, hyping up a film based on what many girls want or dream to be, probably. 1 point for Margot Robbie who is perfect as a barbie-like character, perhaps better becoming the brand ambassador of the brand and stars in all their ads.<br><br>The film, not sure who's their targeting, children to convey the heavy social issues they are trying to preach, or adults to watch this abomination-children-kind of for, apart from the abs of Ryan Gosling and/or Simu Liu that they keep showing, film. The film tried to be funny, 😑, but the real joke is when somebody think that this is a film worth wasting 2 hours of their life. Ridiculous.",2
" Amazing. Gorgeous. Stunning. Depressing.
","This is the first movie I've ever watched that I cannot stop thinking about. The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan.",10
" Easily on of the best movies of all time and I am not joking though you think I am and I ken't believe it myself
","I had high expextations for this Movie: Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, Perfect Casting, Ryan Gosling and then the First Trailer: Our hopes for this beeing something special were high. Yesterday, I saw the movie. It was so great, just so great, My God. Ken is just it. He is just it. Kenough said. You Just Need to buy a ticket, or two and go See it. Some people might Not understand the Movie, maybe your friends or family sitting next to you dont like it. But that is okay. Because you Just wittnessed something special, a historic moment in movie history and you felt it. You know it for sure. And then Barbie ends and all you want to do is Watch it again. Thank you for Making this movie. I will treasure it forever. Thank you, it was so much fun. This is the kend of My Review.",10
" literally perfect
","It exceeded my expectations. Truly an amazing film. Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.<br><br>It think it's a movie that has a significant impact after watching, is highkey emotional and touch themes that probably a 7 year old will not understand. I recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy (I cried twice during the film) and great sense of humor. But if you are a kid, you can also watch it, even though you will not undestand it a 100%, is visually pleasant!",10
" Warning- this is not a family film
","I had my reservations going in due to the fact that this was directed by ""mumblecore"" maestro Gerwig, who was last seen modernising little women to ensure a more feminist ending, but the trailers gave the impression of a fun dish out of water, Elf Meeta enchanted vibe.<br><br>Instead we got an extended diatribe against men for two hours, albeit amidst some funny scenes and lovely set design. Watching empowered, millionaire actors, writers and directors scream about their oppression by all men is not entertaining, and I found it sad later to see all the excited little.girls waiting to see the next show, to know that they are going to spend the afternoon essentially being told of the evils of their Dads, sitting next to them in the screen!",3
" I watched it three times. Here's how I felt.
","1st round<br><br>This is the movie that the world needs right now!!! I almost can't believe Greta Gerwig achieve this!!! She portrayed how the world is secretly (or apparently) patriarchal &amp; how society forces women to pursue their ideal selves and how uncomfortable the world is for us women (and so is for men) in the most colorful, beautiful, and GERWIGING way.<br><br>...my Grammarly app always corrects ""Greta"" to ""Great"", which I think she deserves it.<br><br>It seems like entertainment that is easy to be criticized by conservative ""movie critics"" at first sight, but I am satisfied with the way Greta told the story fairly enough. This movie is so delicious because the script was layered like the various pink colors in the movie. The story seemed to be delightful, modern, and political in a way, but I want to remind you: this movie is for all the Barbies AND Kens.<br><br>I am a 17-year-old Japanese female. What I loved about this movie is:
1. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's Oscar-worthy performances (especially Ryan stealing the show!!)
2. Simu Liu as Ken (whose rival is also Ken)
3. The modern subject which told fairly enough
4. The irony comparing Barbieland and Real World
5. Greta Gerwig's genius writing
6. Perfectly cast Barbies, Kens, and Humans
7. And so many more!!<br><br>At the end of the early screening, we (Japanese audiences, including press-related parties) applaud for 5 seconds which is not bad considering we barely do applause in the theaters.<br><br>I think the world needs more Greta Gerwigs.<br><br>...2nd round
I was lucky enough to attend the Barbie premiere in Japan last night. It was an amazing experience. (The most unforgettable experience in my whole movie nerd life was attending the Aftersun screening where Ms. Wells talked about Chantal Akerman's influence on her creative process.) I want to note about highs and lows in the premiere.<br><br>Highs: Ms. Gerwig seemed such a warm person. Her thoughtful words came from her experience and her attitude seemed awkward in a way. I felt her personality represents the whole movie. What surprised me most was Mr. Heymen (a producer of Harry Potter, who negotiated with Rowling for the movie adoption) being the funniest person in the theater. His jokes were on point, and I see the reason he succeeded in Hollywood exactly in it.<br><br>Lows: The interview was short and formal (it was almost rude), the theater wasn't big enough for this blockbuster's premiere, and the security wasn't enough (I enter the theater without showing my ticket.) I think there are lots of things to improve especially on interview.<br><br>The movie is truly the movie of the decade. When I watched it with my mom two weeks ago, I wasn't ready for everything. Watching it without knowing anything about the central theme felt like the Kens who weren't immune to patriarchy. It's the feeling I never knew I needed. What I disappointed was my mother couldn't understand the whole thing. I won't/shouldn't blame her. She lived patriarchal society in her childhood therefore her minds are not affected by the fact that women shouldn't be disturbed to be anything they want. Honestly she hated the idea. When I told everything I felt as a female after watching it, she just said ""Ryan was so cool."", but she's so real for this sentence despite the fact that she didn't accept the concept.<br><br>Compared to watching it for the first time, I could enjoy it and escape into the barbieland because I know where the story goes. I realize those are completely two different experiences. I could focus more on the well written script, beautiful production design, lots of charming costumes than I could ever imagine in pink, talented actors, and good taste in music. It's almost unbelievable how well Greta created meta-story. It's about postmodernism of the barbieland. It feels like too much awareness sometimes, but it was everything I needed for movies like this. I love An American in Paris and Singin' in the Rain so it was wonderful to see how Greta homages classical musical movies in the golden-age. I am thankful for Greta telling the story in such a meaningful way.<br><br>...3rd round
I attend the screening for high school students held in Warner Brothers Japan. It was surreal experience because no one laughed at the jokes except for me. (Maybe I didn't noticed...?) At the end a girl was crying but that's it.<br><br>9 stars because this movie couldn't convince my sister. She said, ""It's too obvious. I know what Greta wanted to tell, but I can't accept it. Margot and Ryan were great though."" Partly, I agree. Little did she know, she were wrong. (At least to my understanding.) This movie isn't revenge, nor something women have to decline. Greta told the story wisely enough. She care about how can they told the story point of view in portraying Allan and Ken's existential crisis and find their voice fairly. It's obvious? I know what she meant but she don't know anything. At least I know how women and ""minority"" people (lgbtq) suffered so much longer than the movie is. And this world is progressing. Why we shouldn't promote it?<br><br>I have to admit even America Ferrera's monologue couldn't convince my sister. And that's so sad because it felt Greta Gerwig's soul. Lady bird, Frances Ha, Little Women...every time she told monologue, it just gets me. Her words feels as if she wrote it just for me. And I'm sure every other person who loves her words feels the same.<br><br>When I took on the subway, there was a women with two men, talking about stock. She said, ""I don't know what the stock is. It's too complicated!"" And that was just like Barbies before realizing their consciousness!! It's her free will? NO. Showing herself as a weak presence is what the past patriarchy forced women. If she don't understand the stocks, she can learn by herself online! If she needs someone's help it doesn't necessarily have to be two men on the train! (ok if the two were professional I can't say it, but they seems like beginner at stocks because they said, ""it's too simple!"" over and over.) If she want some small talk, that topic shouldn't be what she's not understanding! There's still a disease spreading unconsciously because of what mother told us, how the father behave at home. Changing people's minds is more difficult than climbing the Everest. I hope people like the woman on the subway realize their consciousness through this movie.<br><br>Well, this isn't review but the movie made me think about personal stuff, so this is a messy note to myself.",9
" Terrible....seriously don't waste your money or time
","Wow....<br><br>I have never written a review before but felt compelled to because this was just so terrible.<br><br>I went into this movie only expecting to have fun visuals and a fun story but honestly got neither. I don't even have words for how god awful this was. I'm honestly embarrassed to have even spent the money and bought into the hype.<br><br>Sincerely this is nothing to be excited about. If you must see it. Wait until it streams or look at the few cool scenes in the bio.<br><br>Again, I wasn't expecting this to be some spectacular work of cinema....but to be this bored and to roll my eyes this many times?? Definitely was not expecting that either. Feel like I waisted two hours of my life.",1
" The magical connection between human imagination in the life of a conscious doll!
","Barbie was a big surprise for me, I enjoyed every sip of this delicious pink drink that teleports you to a bright world where imagination is real and reality is just a tiny dreamland nowhere and everywhere. The production design was out of this world and the casting of this movie was perfect, every frame was shot and directed beautifully, in general, the technical aspect was brilliant. Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.",10
" Men need to watch this
","This movie is set for what women experience it's a movie for the men who say ""What if the roles were reversed"" You can call this a feminist or political movie but if equality is that to you that says enough. This movie should be a reflection of men and women it's not a kid's movie they will not understand it but more for those who grew up watching it and playing with dolls as she was the first girl toy that went outside the mother role she is a role model to many young girls who are now women and a lesson to men who will never understand you can call me a feminist by truly women has it hard ""men hate women, women hate women""",10
" Perfection
","The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.<br><br>Hilarious, intelligent, beautiful, poignant, tasteful. This movie makes me warm to the knowledge of being a woman. I will be watching more Greta movies from now on if not all of them. I cried.",10
" Barbie Movie - A Rollercoaster of Disappointment and Deception
","Oh boy, where do I even start with this so-called ""Barbie"" movie? Strap in, folks, because we're about to take a ride on the wild carousel of nonsensical plot twists and missed opportunities.<br><br>Let's talk about character development, shall we? Or rather, the complete absence of it. It's like the writers thought character growth was an urban myth that didn't deserve a place in their script. As a result, we're left with characters flatter than a pancake on a diet.<br><br>And don't even get me started on the plot. Or should I say, the lack thereof? It's as if they jumbled up a handful of clichés, put them in a blender, and pressed the ""random"" button. ""Will they ever find the missing gem? Who cares! Let's throw in a dancing unicorn for good measure.""<br><br>Now, let's talk about the film's blatant false advertising. The trailer promised an epic adventure with heartwrenching emotions. What we got instead was a dumpster fire of wasted potential and shattered dreams. I felt like I was watching a cooking show expecting a gourmet meal and ended up with a burnt toast.<br><br>But you know what? Maybe this is all just a brilliant postmodern experiment in irony. Maybe the creators are secretly geniuses, and we're all just pawns in their grand jest. Or maybe, just maybe, it's a botched attempt at entertainment that left me questioning the very fabric of reality.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a movie that defies all expectations by managing to disappoint on every level imaginable, congratulations, you've found it. The Barbie Movie: where dreams go to die and laughter goes to hibernate.",1
" Barbie the Movie is awesome
","I didn't have a lot of big expectations for this movie, so imagine how happy and surprised I was about how much I enjoyed it! It's silly, and fun and then BOOM- existentialism! While I wouldn't recommend this movie for under 10- there's A LOT of innuendo that will probably go over many younger viewers heads, but there are a couple parts that might not be best for the littles, IMO. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is a lot deeper than one would expect! Margot Robbie is a delight, as is Ryan Gosling. The entire cast is wonderful! Issa Rae never disappoints and her role as President Barbie! A truly fun summer movie!",10
" A letdown
","I was so excited to see this movie for months, even buying some of the merch and promotional products for it, but it turned out to be such a huge letdown. I was expecting it to be a fun, light-hearted, nostalgic movie similar to how the Super Mario movie was, but I left the theater pretty disappointed with Barbie. It does start off cute, but about halfway through the movie it gets very heavy handed with politics, and becomes a complete battle of the sexes. This lasts all the way until the end of the movie. The political messaging starts to become like beating a dead horse by the time the movie is over. What I thought was going to be a fun, relaxing night at the movies turned into what seemed like a political debate. Such a disappointment! I feel like there was so much potential for this to be such a great, fun movie, it really is a shame how it was turned into a battle of the sexes, women are perfect and can do no wrong while men are complete losers showdown. I am a woman myself, and all that political messaging in the movie was so unnecessary. It would have been completely fine to keep the messaging at how girls can grow up to do whatever career they want and they don't have to look a certain way to be beautiful, etc., but this movie was just too over the top with the messaging of women are perfect, women are better than men, etc. It was just all so unnecessary. I did give it a few points because there were a few funny parts in it, and the set was beautiful, but neither of those things could make up for how disappointing it turned out to be.",3
" Incredible
","Barbie was by far one of the best movies i've watched in 2023. From the acting to the costumes, it was all just so amazing. I have no words to express how i feel after watching Barbie. It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster. I hope we can see a sequel to Barbie. The movie deserves all the love. Go watch it now!!!",10
" a love letter to women
","Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig is one of the most anticipated movies of 2023. From the first photos on set to the huge marketing, barbie promised a colourful set and dreamy background where the pastel aesthetic is a fundamental factor. It delivers amazing performances from the whole cast, Robbie and Gosling with unmatched chemistry, Ferrera's monologue and everybody else.<br><br>The message is clear, how it is to be a woman in this reality, a mother, a daughter.. feminism seems superficial but it gives a powerful insight on the matter. Greta managed to tell us how impactful Barbie has been to little girls who dream of being whatever they want but she also criticises how damaging the doll can be to self-conscious girls.<br><br>She exploits the famous figure to make fun of the patriarchy. At first it can be interpreted as a product of capitalism and stereotypes but you'll understand that the same Barbie is criticised in the movie for these same themes. This judgment is already solved in the message of the movie, Greta flips this concept using it to tell the story and its moral.<br><br>It's camp, it's fun and it's pop.<br><br>The script is smart and well written, it makes you laugh and sing and dance but all of it is balanced with profound conversation, Barbie and Ruth Handler, and with the amazingly and hurtfully sincere monologue by Gloria (Ferrera). There's a handful of cinema references, from Kubrick's 2001: space odyssey to The Wizard of Oz, there are jokes on movies that aren't to be taken to seriously, you'll find them funny.<br><br>Jokes on fascism that are culturally genius and a rupture of the fourth wall that you'll absolutely agree with.<br><br>It's not only a feminist message but Barbie expands its themes to Ken's character. The difficulty to found his own identity, to be someone outside of his shadow (his barbie).<br><br>This film is demential and intelligent, an adaptation of the loveable doll, you can have fun with it but also write a whole essay about its moral and heart.",10
" Inspired by every second of this movie
","Firstly, whoever rates this movie below 10 is an empty man or a woman without sense of sensitivity and beauty. This film depicts the harsh truth women must live with, which is that this is "" a man's world"". Not a very pleasant fact when your nature gravitates towards unity, happiness, femininity, not war and power. However, the ending is inspiring and masking the saddening patriarchal reality we are trapped into, therefore you don't leave the cinema being depressed.<br><br>Thank you Greta Gerwig, how much the little girl in me needed the comfort this masterpiece offers, i cannot put into words. Being a woman can be ""very Barbie"" with the right mindset and sanity but in this life's busyness you need a reminder sometimes.<br><br>Thank you to every person who put an effort into creating this 2 hour lesson.",10
" Terribble
","The Barbie movie is a film that fails to captivate its audience. The plot is lackluster and the characters are underdeveloped, making it difficult to become invested in the story The movie is slow-paced and boring, making it a struggle to sit through from beginning to end.<br><br>The Barbie movie is a near-miraculous achievement from Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie. The film is flawed and one of the worst movies of the year. The lack of plot and character development make it difficult to enjoy, and it fails to live up to the expectations of its audience. Overall, the Barbie movie is a forgettable film that is not worth watching, even for fans of the franchise.",1
" Better than I thought
","Begrudgingly, I took my granddaughter and her friend to this movie, who dressed in high heels and pink checkered dresses to match the one Barbie wears in the movie. They looked adorable. It was really good. Not one of my top 10 best ever, movies. But not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I particularly liked the ""KEN"" dance, although the two teenyboppers beside me laughed all the way through the scene. Personally I think Ryan Gosling carried the movie, and the only thing that kept me entertained. He was excellent. I asked the girls if they know what the overall message of the movie was about, and both said ""No"" rather nonchalantly. I asked what was there best part, and both said, ""I don't know"", what was your least favourite part? ""I don't know"". Did you like the movie, and both said ""Yes"". I thought the messaging was good for an adult, but it went over the heads of the young teens.",8
" if you wanna go to the cinema choose oppenheimer
","It seemed like they wanted the barbie movie to be bigger like have this great big message for the audience, bring a whole lotta inspirational stuff but the plot was all over the place cause of all this preaching leading nowhere. Its comedy, tragic, musical, hopeful, inspirational and the list goes on just a mess of a rollercoaster. The preaching is just cringe and too much and when you think about it, it gets hypocritical. They wanted to fit so much into this movie but it didnt flow and work together, they didn't finish the ideas they started. No sort of development to be frank. Only good thing about this movie was Ryan gosling in his role of Ken, he carried the movie and did outstanding other than... dont waste money, energy, time like just dont go at all.",1
" Wonderful

Meaningful subtext while being wildly entertaining!<br><br>All the acting was just delightful! Ryan Gosling even steals the show - though every performance was spot on. Thanks to Greta Gerwig and Mattel for an innovative, thought provoking, gloriously vibrant extravagant movie watching experience. It is destined to be a classic.<br><br>Even better, it has stirred up controversy that hopefully can lead to discourse on the themes embedded in something with such great entertainment value.",10
" Come on Barbie let's go party
","""Barbie"" may seem like an improbable concept for a thought-provoking film, but director Greta Gerwig skillfully harnesses this cultural icon to deliver a potent and profound message. Gerwig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender, demonstrating that Kens in Barbieland face similar challenges as real-world women. The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie's production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera's character brings a layer of relatability to the story. Gerwig's clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience. A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience.",9
" Amazing movie, makes you feel so many emotions!
","This movie is absolutely amazing! It totally makes you think about the current society and what we really do prioritise and favour. Went into it without knowing what sort of angle they would take, and I was so extremely surprised and pleased with how Greta has done this. I can truthfully say I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, however there was times where tears were also shed due to the meaning of the film. Casting was a brilliant choice, Margot was the perfect fit for Barbie and Ryan a great Ken. Also want to mention that America and Kate did awesome jobs with their characters. A must watch, possibly best movie of the year!",10
" So much squandered potential
","I should be the target audience. I am a woman in her thirties that grew up playing with Barbie dolls. Malibu barbie, Stacy, Skipper, Ken and the likes.<br><br>But this movie failed on so many accounts. I cannot for the life of me understand what the message of this movie is/was. What am I take away from this?<br><br>Kens have more fun? No, wait, Kens have all the fun. They can be as stupid as they want and still get really cool songs to sing? (Matchbox 20 is one of my alltime favourite bands - love me some Rob Thomas) They get to take over in 48 hours, not hard at all, because Barbies actually want to be submissive and they have an actual story arc (although kinda leaning into evil territory). That this movie could have had the title Ken - and Barbies do what... ?<br><br>Barbies are what? Meant to be pretty and that's it? That is indeed what breaks this Barbie's (camels) neck. The fact that she isn't pretty anymore. And then we get this superficial ""women are so torn"" monolog in the middle of the movie that missed all the beats it was meant to hit. I am a woman. Was I meant to sympathise? It was a meaningless chain of words strung together to form more meaninglessness. Couldn't have perfect Barbie pulled herself up by her bootstraps? No, she needs the mom? With her superficial observations?<br><br>The Barbie I grew up with was humble. She wouldn't have had this attitude of I know I am perfect, although she of course was. I was missing that too.<br><br>But most of all, and I cannot emphasise how important that is: I hate that Barbie doesn't get to have any fun in this movie. I hate that she doesn't tell Ken in the end that she can't be the one responsible for his happiness. That he has to take responsibility for his own happiness. I hate that Ken is concerned with not having genitals in front of those real world workers. It shouldn't matter to him at this point in the movie (later on, okay), but even a genital-less Ken seems to be afraid of others thinking he has nothing in his pants.<br><br>This is a minor quibble. But the ladies in the beginning that I want to call sturdier than any Barbie I've ever seen body wise... Were there ever such Barbies? I get that the movie wants to be inclusive, but I never got to play with overweight Barbie and I would have liked an explanation for their existence in Barbieland. Just one line would have sufficed.<br><br>There's so much about this movie that doesn't sit well with me, but most of all - even on boring days my Barbies had way more fun than this stereotypical Barbie. She was having real adventures and that is something sorely missing from this movie. Which means I as the viewer had no real fun watching it. Instead I was trying to wrap my head around how nonesensical most of it felt to me.<br><br>Like my header says - squandered potential.",3

The outfits are spectacular. The music is fabulous. The dance scenes are fun! All the details from the pink slide through to the nods to all the retired Barbie friends are so wondrous &amp; nostalgic.

" Barbie: A tale of two halves.
","When I first heard about this movie I had no interest in going to see it.... until I saw the preview. It looked like a light hearted comedy/satire that would be good for the whole family. I thought the cool sets and outfits as well as the basic premise would appeal to my daughters, and there appeared to be enough adult content/nostalgia (which would largely go over their head) to keep the adults happy as well. If I had to say what I thought the movie would be like from the previews; maybe a live-action version of the Lego movies, which I think are quite well done and appealing to a wide audience.<br><br>The movie started out well, with a number of laugh out loud moments and lots of great nostalgia. The second half of the movie however seemed to go off track. The laughs dried up, and the second half or so was really just boring. And the laughs in the theatre were few and far between as well so it wasn't just me.<br><br>My wife enjoyed the movie and would undoubtedly give it a higher rating than I have. My kids fidgeted throughout most of the movie and while they claimed to enjoy it, their behaviour suggested otherwise and they seemed relieved when it finished. I had zero issues with the message the movie was imparting, and didn't find it to be particularly preachy as many reviews suggest. Unfortunately I just found half the movie quite dull, and not what I expected from the preview. It seems like another one of those movies where the best laughs are in the previews and there isn't much more to see beyond that. I left the theatre rather disappointed as I felt this movie had so much potential, particularly given the cast.",5

She always knows how to pull off that intense third act monologue about being a woman that hits you right in your soul and causes you to rethink everything.<br><br>I have never seen a movie that explains how exhausting it is to be a woman not only around men, but around other women.

" Gorgeous
","This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to ""apologize"" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again.",9
" Entertaining I guess...
",I wasn't expecting much from this movie and being honest I thought it was weird that Barbie of all things was getting a live action movie nonetheless I still wanted to give this movie a chance since i used to watch the animated movies as a kid with my sister. Upon finally getting to watch it I would have to say it's pretty boring.<br><br>Barbie starts off fairly well but like nearly half way through I loose interest in watching it. The idea of Barbie having an existential crisis is a great idea and I think the first half of the movie did a good job at that however it kind of lost its edge the longer the movie went on. Margot Robbie plays Barbie wonderfully and is honestly the best thing about the movie (second being Michael Cera and third being John Cena). I some what liked Ken too because he had a fair share of good moments in the movie.<br><br>Overall Barbie is a fairly okay movie but honestly it doesn't live up to the hype.,5
" Barbie!!!
","There was a lot of hype leading up to this movie, because of the cast and simply because it's a movie about Barbie. This movie 100% backed up it's hype. This was a very funny movie with a great storyline. I am going to be honest, I was not expecting it to be that good of a storyline and it truly was.<br><br>It was a weirdly funny movie that also had good morals and a great message behind it. Ryan Gosling stole the show and cracked up the audience basically every-time he appeared on the screen (along with Will Ferrell of course)
Margot Robbie did a phenomenal job as Barbie. Overall it was an amazing watch and no reason this movie should receive any hate!",9
" Good acting but poor storyline
","If it matters for an age perspective, I'm 32. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was disappointing. The actors did a good job with what they were given, and the Barbieland costumes and set design were great. But it was a poor storyline. Being a comedy, there were only about 3 moments that I found funny. I noticed the audience in the theater didn't laugh much either. I think the advertising for this was better than the actual film. The media really hyped this movie up and of course currently all the major headlines are rave reviews. But it's definitely not worth the hype. I know I won't ever watch this movie again.",3
" Surprisingly great
","I had to watch this movie twice. The first time, we missed the first 5 minutes, and the whole movie was confusing and I left feeling bewildered and disappointed. Then I read a review by Michael Knowles, and I realized I missed something very crucial at the start. My teenaged daughter and I went back, and we watch it from the beginning. This is a very clever movie. The layers of cleverness become very apparent when you look beyond the surface. It is a story of current society- and the ills that plague us.<br><br>I think, at first, everyone is concerned about the audience for the movie- it is definitely not meant for younger kids. But it is rated PG-13- I'd say the innuendo is a bit much for 13, but it may just go right over their heads. Ultimately, I think this movie has been very misjudged by a lot of critics. It is way deeper than Barbie maybe should be, but it is great for adults who don't like what they see in our current state of existence.",9
" a fun ride
","This movie was such a fun watch, the comedy (especially by Ryan Gosling) carried the film for me. However the deeper meaning of the movie wasn't lost either.<br><br>Pros: comedy, production/costume, dialogue, acting, casting, the use of Barbie merchandise, culture and nostalgia, music and dancing, cinematography<br><br>Cons: some parts were stretched, the ending could've been delivered better, Will Ferrell was a good addition but it was also not needed, the seriousness of the movie got lost in the comedy at some points where you weren't sure how to feel.<br><br>Overall, I think this movie was a fun watch and I'd probably watch it again.",9
" Pure Escapist Fun
","Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig introduces us to Stereotypical Barbie played by Margot Robbie having yet another perfect day in Barbieland an utopia where all its inhabitants are dolls, living in their pink dreamhouses with no exterior walls. Each day in Barbieland is a perfect day. However one day Barbie shows signs of being a human and is asked to go to the human world to figure out who's playing with her and fix everything. Along the way she discovers the joys and perils of living amongst humans and where she's truly meant to be.<br><br>In this day and age when a lot of the movies rely on being ultra realistic and dark Barbie comes off as a surprise. It's escapism from reality and lots of entertainment is what audiences are craving right now. Barbie is such a fun and gorgeous movie that is filled with humour, heart, emotions and a lot of good messages. The production design and costumes are fantastic to look at and are absolute eye candies. The story is about self discovery and the evaluation of life however some might be caught off guard with the risks that Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take with thier storytelling and social commentary.<br><br>Speaking of the performances, Margot Robbie is perfect as Stereotypical Barbie but its Ryan Gosling's Ken that shines the most. He provides most of the comedic relief and is absolutely hilarious. The rest of cast does a pretty good job. Plus the monologue given by America Ferrera is something that everybody should listen to. It's so touching and talks about the challenges a woman has to go through in the society.<br><br>Overall Barbie is a vibrant, bold and delightful movie that is fuelled by its star studded cast and flawlessly incorporated humour and though some of the creative choices might not always stick the landing, the good stuff largely overpowers the bad ones to create an immersive experience for the audience. Greta Gerwig has done it yet again.",9
" A pointless movie
","For me this is the most pointless movie I've ever watched. I really don't understand where all this hype came from. My expectations were not that high considering the type of movie, but sill I waa not prepared for this -&gt; which is the reason why I leave my first review in IMDB.<br><br>For me this movie is just milking the Barbie brand. Great cast though! The sets, the costumes, the colours - these was perfect. And the actors play so well that you actually cringe while watching :)<br><br>So, should you watch it?<br><br><ul><li>Haha no. Don't waste your time and money, spend some time with your friends instead and buy them a drink :)</li></ul>",3
" Great for adults and children
","I saw this movie with my wife and daughter today and all of us agreed this was a fantastic movie. There were very progressive messages for children. I love the 2001 space odyssey intro.<br><br>The acting was superb and there was a lot of great attention to detail by the cinematography crew. The soundtrack was catchy and my daughter loves the Dua Lupa and Billy Eilish songs. There were several laugh out loud moments. It seems like everyone, both adult and child were thoroughly entertained. I would recommend this movie to both adult and children. I would also recommend seeing it on the big screen to capture all the details.",10
" Mediocre
","I liked the inital idea where they aproach sexism thru barbie, the oldes concept of feminism that actually took a opposite turn. But, the point was neither here nor there, and I felt like it changed as the movie continued. The ending was whole another story and not well put together with the rest of the plot. I found the characters too romantic, poetic and naive. The parts that I did like was ryan goslings acting, some parts of his character were pretty funny. Also, the musical numbers were great and I liked the costumes and props. Also, the idea of life in barbieland is kind of funny and amusing.",5
" So beautiful!
","This movie was so emotionally moving in a way that I didn't expect at all. I loved how critically it evolves around the Barbie and Ken figure and questions everything you ever took for granted in a very nice and intelligent way. I absolutely loved this movie and would watch it again any time.<br><br>I sobbed for most half of the movie, at the end it comes down to why it's important to be a human and not trying to be perfect.<br><br>The cast was also amazing. Great acting. Almost all of the cast of sex education is in it which was really cool to see. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't like or didn't play with Barbie.",10
" Great but not without flaws
","This movie was an absolute hoot at my screening! A week after it's release, my theater was packed with people, laughing and clapping throughout the whole film. It was a great experience, and I really enjoyed the movie. Michael Cera was probably my favorite actor along with Ryan gosling and surprisingly Kate McKinnon. The story and adventure was really fun, I was absolutely in love with the visuals throughout the film, and I thought the self awareness was really refreshing. The music also energized the film throughout. With all that being said, I did have two complaints. The first is that the conclusion of the movie is that men and women can't work together, and I think that was a really strange choice. I understand that the movie wanted to empower independence but collaboration is also very important. Second complaint, why the heck was there a Chevrolet commercial in the middle of the movie? Anyways loved the movie and can't wait to see what Greta Gerwig does next.",8
" Touching and educational
","This movie should be seen by everyone in my opinion. Literally. I don't care if you don't like Barbies or pink, because this movie is so much more than that. It makes both women and men feel valid about their experiences and highlights how unequal our whole world currently is. The movie is also very comedic and has some really cool easter eggs about Barbie dolls and the development Barbie. The movie was very mature in my opinion and isn't necessarily a kids movie even though it's called ""Barbie"", a doll. It didn't have too much K18 references but sexual harassment towards the main character was present so that should be taken into account when wanting to see the film with a child.<br><br>Overall, absolutely beautiful movie and really touching. It's not only about toys, it's about life. Go watch it!",10
" Awful movie with some good performances.
",I'm a little lost as to who the target audience is.<br><br>My guess would be females in their 20's because I doubt any young children will understand the preachy politics of the story.<br><br>The look of the entire movie was too in-your-face. The songs and dancing were uncomfortably cringe worthy. The whole look and feel to the film was a mix of confusing and annoying at times.<br><br>The only plus (and the reason I gave it a 3 and not a 1) was Ryans performance which was amusing at almost every turn. Weirdly this is the most versatile acting I've ever seen from him and ironically he was playing a plastic doll.<br><br>Overall I'd avoid this film at all costs.,3
" A great movie for all grown ups and teens
","I can only recommend to see this joyful movie with an incredible cast.<br><br>If you like fun, creativity, colors and a great plot that is both entertaining and thoughtful this is one of the best movies you can see.<br><br>Songs are OK but choreographies are amazing. Everything in the movie is weird but in the best sense because it is unlike any other movie. Ryan Gosling plays both a brilliant regular guy and kinda stupid at the same time, which is super cute and sensitive. While the movie is full of intentional stupidity and fun, it makes us man rethink manhood, not really because of the feminist discourse - which is a bit too much present here - but in more subtile way because of Gosling's character reactions and evolution throughout the movie.<br><br>It is also a movie about American culture at its best : Barbieland is a reflection of America and vice-versa. The plot nourishes itself brilliantly from that reflection and challenges both men and women's conception of our dreams. Consumerism, business, idealism, self deprecative humour, all ingredients are there. The only downside we can find to this movie is the labyrinth style plot that is too stretched sometimes and unnecessary. More importantly this makes it unsuitable for younger audience. Thank you Mattel for this piece of fun !!",9
" Barbie in-depth review
","It is undeniable that this film has done excellent marketing and the competition has only enhanced it. With a good cast and good direction, the film goes beyond what may appear or be implied.<br><br>Clearly, if you go to see this movie you already have an idea of what to expect and what not to expect. However, it does not appeal to all audiences: regardless of the film's intended or interpreted approach, it is not for a child audience and goes beyond the Barbie audience; the film strays too far into different ideals, in some cases, somewhat exaggerated and from a somewhat hypocritical point of view, although they end up being relatively solved at the end of the film.<br><br>Beyond that, the film is comical and entertaining, without becoming boring throughoust, although it is distinctive and ungainly, without being a positive thing in some specific apects.<br><br>Barbie is made up of a great team that has done a great job to bring the film to the big screen and reach a lot of people, even though the audience that is really targeted and satisfied is very specific; it might not be the kind of movie you were expecting, not only because of its simple, unrealistic and somewhat absurd plot, but because of the path it takes towards the situation of the moment, represented in a way far from reality because of its absurdity and exaggeration in many aspects (this does not discredit the reality of the general idea of the film, but it does discredit the way it is conveyed).<br><br>Having said that, the film is never boring, although it can be uncomfortable, absurd and, obviously, unrealistic. Within the limits of fiction, the general idea of the film is clear and understandable, although the plot can be improved and there are a couple of good and charismatic characters. If you are clear about what you are going for and keep in mind what I have said without disliking it, the film will not disappoint you.",5
" Loved it
","This movie is amazing. It perfectly describes womanhood in a way few movies that I've seen has. It shows how different women and men are treated and also the feeling of growing up as a woman. I started to miss all my childhood Barbies that we gave to my little cousin now. It's also completely hilarious and the cast is absolutely perfect. Almost No one else could play Barbie and Ken as good as Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling has. Even though it's technically about Barbie's DOSENT MEAN that it's aimed for children. It's perfect for women of all ages, and for men to learn more about what it's like to simply grow up and simply exist as a woman.",10
" Fun flick!
","It boggles the mind how anyone could be offended at a fun film like Barbie. Honestly, it says more about the offended than it. Does anything else.<br><br>Barbie was a fun, lighthearted, flick, with a great message, encouraging everyone to find themselves.<br><br>Barbieland starts a place where women hold the positions of power, any job they want, and their own success is independent of any man. For men upset by this, please take pause and try really hard to see that maybe this is how real life women have been feeling for hundreds of years.<br><br>Barbie does an excellent job to show the audience that everyone, men and women, need to learn who they are aside from their partners, their possessions, their job, and their social status.<br><br>The jokes at Mattel's expense were enjoyable, and very surprising that the company let those stay in.<br><br>I very much enjoyed seeing several stars from Sex Education in the film, and great to see them in these roles. Costume design was on point, and the site design was so cool to see.<br><br>Despite being upbeat and usually fast paced, the film ended on a much slower note, which was a little disappointing. Overall, it was a great viewing experience, and it's quite the laugh that anyone could be offended by it I would be like this.",8

" Overhyped
","Really good soundtracks and amazing cast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were incredible. The jokes were funny too. I also liked the little details in the movie, like Barbie's iconic clothes, or the matrix reference back with weird barbie. But the story and overall everything wasn't as exceptionally good and enjoyable as everybody promises, especially if we compare it to the quantity of hype and advertising it got. Also, I wasn't, and I'm still not sure what audiences it is for. Sure, they say ""It's for everybody"", but no, I don't think it's for everybody. Shortly, worth to watch, but definitely not a Godfather.",4
" Good
","The Barbie motion picture is one of the most captivating and thought-provoking productions of this year. When I watched the movie, not only did I witness an entertaining story, but I also appreciated the attention paid to important social issues such as feminism, women's rights and gender equality.<br><br>The movie is full of strong and independent female characters. Barbie's courage and determination inspires young viewers and conveys the message that they can achieve anything. I was also impressed by the way the stories in the movie were constructed. The personal development of the characters and the relationships between them lead the audience to deep thoughts.<br><br>The Barbie movie skillfully weaves social messages, emphasizing that women are strong and deserve to have equal rights. I believe that such productions are extremely important in terms of instilling positive values in young generations and raising social awareness.<br><br>In conclusion, I give the Barbie movie a full score and recommend it to anyone who is thinking of watching this movie. For an entertaining, inspiring and thought-provoking experience, I suggest you don't miss this movie.",10
" Not worth your time.
","It's a shame because I love Little Women and Lady Bird. Barbie did not serve.<br><br>It's a long ramble about how matriarchy is perfect and patriarchy is stupid. I'm agreeing with the latter, but the execution is just awful. The CEO and corporate people of Mattel started as a mock to men having all the top positions of a company, as the movie goes they're just there at the back of your mind and it's unpleasant experience because they did not do anything after. So many unnecessary scenes that could've been meaningful. For example, what's the scene Allan fighting other Kens for? There are so many seeds planted at once but none of them grew into their fullest potential. Here are some examples:<br><br>1. The mother and daughter relationship: It started well, the daughter is disconnected with her mother. You thought the movie will revolve about fixing that problem? No. The daughter has no problem. She's just a teenager.<br><br>2. Mother's longing for her daughter: The reason why barbie became curious about death is because the mother is playing with her barbie *differently*. She's drawing *weird* (sigh) Barbies. You thought it was because she had a rough childhood and now is the time to heal her inner child? No, she misses her time playing with her daughter. While it is an alright backstory, I see no reason how it is related to Barbie getting curious on death.<br><br>3. Patriarchy: It's always shown that patriarchy is for stupid men and their horses. The corporate people who are all men tries to catch Barbie so they can send her back to Barbieland. But barbie went to Barbieland and they STILL FOLLOWED HER. It took them too long to get there for no apparent reason. And when they get there it just gets very confusing. Why are they in there?<br><br>4. Barbie wanting to be human: This should've been the theme of the movie. The point of the movie should've been about what Barbie saw to make her realize she wants to be human. But no, it was only a few minutes when she's seeing people laughing and some people are sad. After that, there was no more of it. They tried to push this in the ending but it just doesn't feel right because of the lack of motivation. Although it was expected. They wasted the whole time with cameos and other meaningless scenes.<br><br>I am disappointed in this movie. It's not worth the hype.",1
" screaming crying throwing up
","This movie is not only an actually funny comedy with an amazing script and good jokes, but a seriously intense story of womanhood, girlhood and motherhood that portrayed how much the patriarchy affects everyone. As a girl, this movie resonated with me and every single line about being a girl in this world hit me hard, but it was so beautiful. I've seen men say that this movie was 'feminist garbage' or 'over-exaggerated' but it honest to god wasn't. Not only this, but while being a movie that accurately represents the feeling of not knowing who you are or what you are going to be (aka girlhood) it was pro-men and not in a bad way. Somehow, a movie so strongly empowering women also gave men feeling and hurt. This made the movie so honest and just good. I could go on for hours about how much this movie means to me, and that it's something with messages that will stick with me forever.<br><br>With all this being said, it was funny as hell and my whole theater was dying at some of the jokes made 😭 they did not hold back.",10
" Barbie is human... Cinematography was amazing But what kind of script is this really?
","First 10mins was annoying, then it came around as it showed us it was self-aware enough to realise. Over and hour in i was enjoying it. The comedy is on point all round. Then came the part when the women plot to lie and ""cheat"" on their boyfriends at the beach...
That was a bit evil?. Im sure a lot of kids went to see this film and teens. The cinema i was in was sure packed but that wasnt a good message. ""To save barbieland we must lie and cheat on our boyfriends"" not sure a lot of parents would like that message either. Then the film wraps up wonderfully about barbie becoming human and herself instead of playing the role of barbie which was wonderful.. But are we supposed to just pretend and forget the message of this film just five minutes ago is to cheat on your boyrfriends and lie to them once youve gained their trust and made them happy? Hmm. Ryan gosling however was amazing to witness. Totally amazing just like he was in any other gosling film. Drive and blade runner being my favs.<br><br>I will rewatch this because the comedy is very much on point but ill fast forward a lot of the extremist feminist speeches as they leave a questionable aftertaste when examined. I cannot give this film a 10 even though you can tell the production budget is amazing as were the acting. Go and see it if you have the itch. But it's not for everyone.",8
" Best movie ever
","Honestly, this is the best movie I've ever seen. The roles are so perfectly played and everyone did such a good job on this movie. I love it so much, came with a bunch of friends, my mom, their moms, and my little sister. Everyone said that they lived the movie. The ending made me cry but in such a good way, like how Barbie was when she experienced sadness for the first time. Seeing a movie that doesn't have the patriarchy spreader all over it is so refreshing, and honestly, if you're mad at this movie, you might be part of the problem. Seeing Ruth appear and give Barbie a talk was so amazing and such an emotional experience. I loved it so much I can't even explain. Seeing women even in movies come together and address problems is so refreshing.<br><br>When the mom gave the speech about being a mom and a woman was so amazing and it had such a good message written into it.<br><br>And can we talk about how well Will Ferrell played his role? And don't even get me started on Margot's acting. Literally amazing, she played her role so well<br><br>This movie was a cinematic masterpiece to say nothing more. At the end when Barbie said her name (Barbara) was so amazing because she was originally named after Ruth's daughter, I loved that so much.<br><br>And honestly I think that everybody needs to see this movie, no matter what your standpoint on life is, everyone needs to see this movie.<br><br>And seeing a movie describe and mention how harmful the patriarchy is in such a funny way was absolutely amazing. I could go on and on about how good this movie made me feel but I would be here all day.<br><br>It was such a good movie and I would definitely watch it again. Such a good watch.",10
" Spoiler alert
","Spoilers Ahead - Firstly Ryan Gosling was the only good thing about this film. The stupid thing is when Barbie went to the real world she hated how there were a lot of males in leadership positions, even though in Barbie Land it is entirely run by females and then wonders why Ken wanted to change things in Barbie land when she felt the same way as ken in the real world. This lead to ken being the villain and no it was not Will Ferrel character as the bad guy as he wanted to keep barbie land the way it was not to have ken take over so it was in fact ken to believed to be the bad guy. Then the really stupid thing comes at the end when she fights hard to change her home back into barbie land then decides to go and live in the real world which she hated because of the male dominance. Also the whole female don't have power thing is getting a bit old as these days there are strong powerful woman in successful leadership jobs.",1

","First, lower your expectations and second, this is not a children's movie. Lastly, don't take it seriously.<br><br>Go in with those three things in mind and if you have any sense of humor, you will really enjoy this film.<br><br>It's honestly really dumb fun, along the lines of Anchorman or Talladega Nights. No, it's probably not as good as either of those, but is along the same comedic line and it is really funny and charming.<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both hysterical and do a great job in the movie. The entire theater laughed out loud through most of the movie. The supporting cast was spot on as well.<br><br>There was a ton of reminiscing happening in the theater. You could hear countless women whispering ""I had that play set!"" Or ""I had that Barbie outfit."" That made the movie more enjoyable for many.<br><br>Overall the movie was really good. In my opinion, the only misses were, every man in the movie was over the top stupid. No reason for that. And I believed the ending should have gone in a different direction, but I won't spoil it with my opinion.",8
" Rushed
","I'm a single guy. I studied a little gender roles while I was in college, and actually went to the movie with 3 of my best friends I made from that course. I was really optimistic about the movie.<br><br>Personally as the title suggests the movie felt rushed. There are some parts and themes in the movie that are really well-developed, and some parts that are just overwhelmingly bad, including some of the larger arguments about gender roles found throughout the movie.<br><br>A lot of the film is saved by the fact it is played out in a way where they're from a set of a little girls play house, so a lot of critiques can be overlooked.<br><br>I didn't go in wanting to hate this movie. I wanted to see a movie of the caliber of its star-studded cast, but it was bit of a let down to me.",5

This movie beats out Oppenheimer in every way possible, me and the boys pulled up to Barbie excited! Will Ferrell was pretty good too as well as all the actors. The Kens dancing as well as all the horses brought tears to my eyes. Also the best part I have to say is at the very end the Barbie song by Ice Spice it slapped I had to watch the credits just to listen to the song. 10/10 would recommend. This film was perfect in every way down to each and every frame.",10

It was very empowering and encouraging to young girls then ending is unexpected and kind of sad but the movie did not disappoint I was worried it wasn't gonna live up to the expectations but it exceed the expectations I want to watch it again and again I also love the marketing for this movie it deserves a higher rating. I hope there's a part 2 going into more detail so we get even more context about the choices and decisions or a continuation of the ending I also loved how they put the original barbie creator and inspiration for barbie that was a nice touch But it needed nicki minaj.,10

They really had a good cast and the script is full of endless nonsense and pointless conversations.<br><br>It mixes intentions to try to make Barbie look good but at the same time makes adult like comments that don't make it kid friendly.<br><br>I wish the money could be returned because this was not worth it. Better luck next time.<br><br>The 7.1 review on IMDB is completely deceiving.",2
" Amazing flick
",Interesting look at barbies world but maybe not enough pink 😂. Loved the musical numbers and the star studded cast who did not falter on their delivery. The unfortunate truth of the real world's Patriarchal society is laid out perfectly. Sound track was awesome especially Lizzo. Have to say fun to see all the pink outfits rolling into the cinemas not many icons can have this effect. Sex and the city excluded. Doesn't take itself too seriously and deffinetly falls into the comedy genre comfortably. Will Ferrell is a great addition although I word have liked to have seen more of him. In the end it is Barbie's world.,9
" Barbie Is As Plastic As The Doll
","I love Greta Gerwig (and met her once and told her so!) but this is not her finest work.<br><br>Barbie is a girl power message film delivered with a sledgehammer to the senses.<br><br>$1.4 billion dollars later, what do I know?!<br><br>A good film to sit back and enjoy, I do know, and this wasn't it.<br><br>Empty of substance and heavy on repetition of girls rule made it a boring soulless film. It's as vacuous as it is pretty to look at.<br><br>Margot Robbie is always a joy to watch and that's the case here. She just has nothing to do beyond escaping 'Barbieland' and getting into trouble along with her pea-brained boyfriend Ken, played by Ryan Gosling (and others in various cameos)
Good enough for a series of skits on SNL, but thin for a two hour film.<br><br>This film was targeted to kids and it obviously worked - and if positivity comes out of that then wonderful.<br><br>Otherwise, wait until it's on Netflix and skim through
it's monotonous plotting.",3

This was like a fever dream and I can't wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again. I did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears. A movie everyone should go and watch. And how beautiful that Billie Eilish song was! We will definitely hear it live next year at the Academy Awards, where I hope Greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this (already) iconic film. Production design, script, directing, acting (especially Ryan bodied that role) and Best original song I would want to see awarded.",10
" Barbie or: A Wonderful Romp About Agency and Self-Realization
","The surface-level: Barbie is vibrant, fun, and immensely enjoyable. Robbie and Gosling are stellar, and Gerwig's camera has never been in better focus.<br><br>What I really want to talk about is the idea of perfection and that flaws are not deterrents; flaws are what make us who we are.<br><br>Barbie is perfect. But what is perfection? Beauty? Endless dance parties? A world where everyone gets along? A world without worry? No; those are hollow. Perfection is an illusion. There is no happiness or self-worth in perfection. Perfection is a lie that hides the real joy of life.<br><br>Owning who you are, finding joy with yourself, being brave enough to face the conflicts each rising sun brings, and combating the fear that you aren't good enough is where real, true experiences are found.<br><br>Barbie is perfect, and she wants to maintain her perfection. But as her journey unfolds, she discovers something better-self-realization.<br><br>Ken lacks agency, and Barbie cannot give that to Ken. He must find it himself. Barbie is about empowerment, discovery, and owning the person you are. No one defines you; you define you.<br><br>Barbie and Ken's first experience in the real world is an all-too-expected scene. Unfortunately, the likely reaction to it from some will also be expected.<br><br>Barbie is an object, something to obtain. Ken is a person, someone to converse with or admire. The difference in experience is drastic, and-sadly-one that will surely be looked over and taken at face value.<br><br>The point of the scene is not ""it's hard to be a woman."" The point is that Ken is oblivious to the difference. He's so wrapped up in his own experience that he can't see Barbie's. He doesn't question why their experiences are different; he doesn't care. He just wants his experience to be enjoyable. He wants his life to be more, even at the expense of others.<br><br>Too many will see it as surface level. And too many will refuse to dig deeper. Instead, they'll be content to be outraged or faux-offended. ""My life is hard too!"" they'll say. And that's the point. Her life is hard, his life is hard, everyone's life is hard. Consideration is all it takes to better both.<br><br>Barbie has a lot to say about agency and self-realization, and really, the film is quite meta in the best way.",9
" It's a good movie
","It's a good movie. Walking out of it I knew people wouldn't like it considering we rarely have a women's actual point of view in cinema. It's actually quite funny seeing people's reactions to it as if everything that we were showed in the 2 hours of the movie isn't true.<br><br>In my viewing people were clapping, laughing and crying. It's touching and I'm sure many will relate wether people want to admit to it or not. (This movie isn't about a perfect doll)<br><br>That being said if you don't like musicals you might not love this movie there are quite a few numbers in this film. Not bad ones just some are abit longer than I'd like.<br><br>Overall I'd watch again and I've never actually owned a Barbie 👍🏼",8
" Uncomfortable watch
","The most political movie I have ever watched. It is so confusing that you can't be sure what its target audience is. It looks like they wanted it to be profound, but putting too much 'woke' content made it boring and cringe. As a woman, I honestly felt quite uncomfortable seeing how all the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid and shallow human beings.<br><br>Overall, 4/10 for good acting, good music, and good costumes.<br><br>I went to watch this movie as I heard it is not just an easy going entertaining one like everybody was expecting but touching and deep. I was curious. And I walked out of the cinema hall wishing that this movie was that simple as expected.",4
" had two different ideas about this film
","Before watching it, i thought this movie going to be just a pop corn movie with beautiful cinematography and colors and with good actors doing their job as always really well. But when i started watching, ive got the different idea of this movie, i was expecting more of a Wolf Among Us video game style type of thing. While watching this move i expected more and more from it, but ive got dissapointed in the end that it ended in cliche, no plotwist and nothing original way. Would have been amazing if they made exactly same idea like that Wolf Among Us game. Imagine Barbies and Kens living in our world, but in a dark our world's natural way. If film makers made it this way and nailed it, i would have gave this 10/10. Now im giving 8/10 which is a decent score for this movie, because of its cringe worthy last 30 minutes of the ending or so. Loved the joke in the very end, and loved couple of Matrix easter eggs.",8
" Could have been amazing..
","I loved Barbie as a child, so when my teenage daughter wanted to go see it at the premiere, I was on!<br><br>The movie started out great, and I really enjoyed the first part with all the funny details, and I loved that they made sure to also include a lot of the most hilarious discontinued Barbie products.<br><br>The silly and perfect take on barbieland with the amazing actress Margot Robbie playing ""stereotypical barbie"" was hitting ALL the right notes, and I couldn't wait till she was introduced to the hard reality of the ""real world"".<br><br>Sadly this is where the innovative and creative vibe ends, as the ""real world"" is just as (if not even more) silly and unrealistic than Barbieland - presenting an extreme reality where unintelligent powerhungry men completely run the world and not one single women is able the have any job of significance.<br><br>Making the entire thing even worse, atleast the last 45 mins of the movie is the morale of.. well.. everything..<br><br>To be honest ive never been a big fan of Ryan Gosling, and sadly his role as ""Ken"" didn't help. It wasn't really funny, just sad, and the big moment when the barbies was fighting back wasn't really him realising he was wrong, just that him and the other ""Kens"" couldn't really do anything about the fact that the women had taken over barbieland, and they just gave up?<br><br>All in all ""Barbie"" was a great idea, with a great cast, and it's obvious that they had done their homework when it came to the history of barbie. Sadly it ended up as quite a mess, as the story didn't make any sense - leaving me with a lot of questions.",3
" IM BAD LIKE THE BARBIE IM A DOLL BUT I STILL WANT TO PART!!! 🌸💓🎀👙💄
","Everything about this movie was incredible. The casting was on point, the sets are eye catching, the soundtrack is delectable! I can not express how much this movie has impacted my life. After seeing it not once, not twice, but three times it gets better and better every time. This movie is so hilarious while also being profound and thought-provoking. I left the theater crying all 3 times, each time shedding more tears than the last. Watching it with my mother was truly a special experience as I got to see how the themes of the movies impacted her as well. I think about this quote at least once a day,"" Mothers stand still so their daughters can look back and see how far they've come."" I would recommend the Barbie Movie to anyone and everyone!",10
" A Fun Summer Box Office
","As one of the most anticipated films of the year, Barbie has managed to meet all audience expectations -especially cinephiles - and make it the most daring film of the year. Director Greta Gerwig (supported by screenwriter Noah Baumbach) doesn't just deliver a successful portrayal of all aspects of this popular icon: colorful set designs, stunning costumes and make-up, great music (they all sing!), the history of the Barbie doll, but also social commentary and philosophical analysis on existentialism, patriarchy, feminism, diversity, inclusion and all that packaged in sarcasm in the modern sense. As a film, Barbie delivers it all: fun, excitement and seriousness. The casting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken is also the right choice. Barbie reminds us again that summer box office hits can be really fun and good.",9
" Good Movie
","The film is also visually stunning, with bright colors and catchy music. The costumes are particularly impressive, with Barbie sporting a variety of iconic looks from throughout her history. The Barbie movie is a fun and heartwarming film that is sure to leave a lasting impression.<br><br>Here are some of the things that I liked about the Barbie movie:<br><br>The film is a subversive take on the Barbie brand. It challenges the idea that Barbie is just a pretty face and shows that she is a strong, independent woman who is capable of anything.<br><br>The film is a celebration of female empowerment. It encourages girls to dream big and reach for the stars.<br><br>The film is visually stunning. The bright colors and catchy music make it a joy to watch.<br><br>The costumes are particularly impressive. Barbie sports a variety of iconic looks from throughout her history.<br><br>Here are some of the things that I didn't like about the Barbie movie:<br><br>The film is a bit slow-paced in the first act.<br><br>The film could have done more to explore the themes of female empowerment.<br><br>The film is a bit too long.<br><br>Overall, I thought the Barbie movie was a great film. It is a fun, heartwarming, and thought-provoking film that is sure to entertain audiences of all ages. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good movie to watch.",10
" Not what I expected-disappointed
","First off, I will look at the positive aspects. Margot played a beautiful Barbie. Not only was she pretty, her acting skills shined. However, I felt that the message conveyed here was poor, inappropriate, or unnecessary. I left the theater not feeling great about myself or the world. I did not enjoy how they had to put Ken down to make Barbie better, perhaps that is not what we should do, perhaps we should make everyone better.<br><br>There were several clever references to pop culture that I thought were good. But perhaps they should have pop culture references that people seeing Barbie would like.",5
" I've always loved BARBIE films but I love this one more!
","So good, the emotions, the reality and how it came together as a live action BARBIE film was perfect and outstanding which is good for adults as well as children. I am so impressed how well this was pulled off and the details from the outfits to the design of the sets was outstanding. There was laughing and crying in this film and which relates to everyday life and having all the different barbies was brilliant! My favourite has to be the weird BARBIE because I definitely relate to her more! I recommend watching this and giving it a go because you may think oh it's just a kids film but once you've watched it, it's not what you expect and I'm itchy to watch it again!",10
" A smart look at an important problem? Well...no
","I had high hopes for this movie. The director of ""Barbie"" is, in my opinion, a pretty high caliber filmmaker. I hoped that she would be able to make the movie both beautiful and funny from the visual point of view, and at the same time be able to give the movie a subtle, deep meaning. And the movie succeeded in the former. It's funny, it's witty, it's beautiful!<br><br>As for the meaning behind the work, there are already hints in the first half of the movie that Gerwig wanted to and could subtly comment on the social structure of the modern world. That the film would criticize and at the same time reveal all sides of the problem. True, life is an ambiguous thing, there is neither pure good nor absolute evil..... Oh, where am I going with this? This movie is not worth the effort. In the second half, the movie turns into a primitive agitation with a simple idea of ""men are bad, and all women are oppressed, so girl, get up, we'll show them all"".... Okay, actually, if there is a large audience of people who want to hear such thoughts. If there are those who care (and they do) - then such a work has a right to exist. But. The thing is that in the end we have a fanfic praising some people and belittling others, a work for a specific audience. And, on the one hand, it's great, it's wonderful that there's something that brings someone joy. But for me, on the other hand, it is absolutely useless, uninteresting to watch such a movie that ridicules men and belittles them. It's... wrong. I expected to see a smarter, deeper work, a meta-view of all sides of the issue. But apparently, modern audiences won't be able to understand such a product, they need to be shown something simple. Alas.",5
" A lot better than I expected! Amazing, with a bit of a stretched ending
","I expected this movie to be a quick predictable cashgrab with as much stars as possible for the poster, it turned out to be way more. It has its flaws, but they quickly move past that.<br><br>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling absolutely killed it. It had great social commentary, while still being funny and wildly entertaining. The design is great, from set design to music to choreography. It's a feast to see all those stars dancing together, and the use of color is amazing.<br><br>The story was well illustrated, with showing you the message clearly, they sometimes straight up tell you things, but those things are well explained in the context.<br><br>The real world part didn't stick to its own rules, sometimes it was complete fantasy when it needed to be, and sometimes it was supposed to be ""harsh reality"" which therefore just didn't work. Cliché's and tropes were sometimes a bit too much, but I didn't really expect something else than that. The end-conversation was a bit pretentious, and a bit weaker than it tried to be for me. I could understand that it hit all the right spots for somebody else. The jokes were great, and I laughed a lot. Loved how it looked like the lego movie sometimes.<br><br>8,2/10
Well done. Now Im gonna watch Oppenheimer.",8
" Barbie is going to be one for the girls!
","This is just one of the two films that are released on the same day (the other being Oppenheimer). Firstly, the movie itself was good; a few comic jokes here and there along with a few heartfelt moments at the end. But I'm not technically a Barbie fan; I just see something that I fancy on the big screen and watch it!<br><br>Anyway, after watching the movie, I thought to myself, ""Gosh, I'm amazed at how the filmmakers got to create such a variety of cast members, as well as make such a great movie for the girls to enjoy.""<br><br>For someone as me - who is somewhat of a film expert and a cinema employee - to see what might be just the most iconic blockbuster movie of the year so far, I have to say that it could (by a margin) be busy for the first couple of weeks of the summer holidays!<br><br>Overall, though it was good, it's not my favourite movie as I'm not a fan of the doll franchise.",8
" Pink Magic!!!!!
","The most anticipated summer movie turned out to meet my expectations. The sets,acting,costumes,story line everything was pink magic. It is a very inspiring movie for girls but I think a bit too much feminism and toxicity.<br><br>No doubt, the movie is advertising barbies but it's still a good find.<br><br>It's light hearted and it kept it's humor throughout the film., even in deep scenes. The cast was perfect for their own respective roles but something was very disappointing for me that literally Dua Lipa's role was less than two minutes.<br><br>Overall I think the movie is worth watching once in your life and it will be memorable. The soundtrack is perfect
Dance the night by Dua Lipa was perfectly in place and also What was I made for.<br><br>When I watched What was I made for on YouTube, I did not like it but in the cinema it was perfect.<br><br>It is a great movie but not everyone will like it
Waiting for Barbie number 2 now. Hopefully next summer.",9
" Go se oppenheimer instead.
",Even though gosling gives ken such of a good play. This movie was to peachy. Really not good in my opinion but it was a good movie to sleep to. And my five year old daughter was so happy to see the movie and she loved the popcorn. And the ending was amazing to be a bad movie. I'd say the movie is good in the beginning but it's still badly written and the plot isn't good enough to make a movie like this one or something else that I think is better in that regard and it's not that good at the same level of story but it still makes it a great film to see and see and it is worth a watch and I don't know if.,4
" Unexpected well done societal criticism
","Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions.",8
" The stupidest movie I've seen
","I knew Barbie would be lame movie, but I didn't exepct to be sooooo lame!!!! I went to see it just for the sake that this is the first movie of a kind and I thought there will be some valuable content somehow, but this was such a waste of time. Dont waste your time and money to see this move, its not worth it! Such a dissapointment from Margot Robi and Ryan Gosling to star in something this stupid and shlallow. They could've make something better with the story and the acting, this was amateur level completely. The scenery in Barbieland was nive though, I beleive every girl will see something she owned when she was little. Not recommended!!!",1
" Not better than Oppenheimer but a fun movie
","I saw it in a theater the day after I saw Oppenheimer and it was a fun movie.<br><br>I honestly think Margot Robbie is perfect as barbie in this movie. Ryan Gosling as Ken is also good. I think that because of the movies PG-13 rating the movie doesn't target audience aren't kids and there were some violence scenes and Barbie really mentions a lot of death and she has thoughts of dying.<br><br>The movie opened $155M and I think it's going to reach $1B at the worldwide box office.<br><br>The things I really liked some of the soundtrack. The soundtrack features Billie Eilish, Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj, Dua Lipa, and so much more singers. I also really loved the song Just Ken by Ryan Gosling. I also loved the idea of making this movie and the director Greta Gerwig is just a great film director from movies such as Lady Bird and Little Women.<br><br>Some scenes were very boring but I guess it's ok.<br><br>I just think that you can't compare this movie to Oppenheimer because Oppenheimer is way better.<br><br>It's a good movie.<br><br>It's still a good movie and my expect.",8

" A fun ride!
","This movie was such great experience to live. It's a fun, entertaining, deep, and amazing piece of art. It was very funny at times, made me cry other times, and made me feel nostalgic and warm and proud and all of these different feelings. But most importantly it made me think! I really love it when movies discuss topics that matter and shake your ideas a little bit. I loved the cast, the costume designs, the music and everything in between. Margot Robbie is a queen, her acting was amazing and she's just the perfect cast for this role. Also, Ryan did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Judging by the propaganda that surrounded it and the hype around it I didn't have high expectations but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. Also, I have to say that the story of this movie is very very similar to ""Free guy"" the one with Ryan Reynolds but it was done well so I can't complain.",8
" Really Disappointed
","Was very much looking forward to this movie. It's, unfortunately, terribly written. They needed to figure out how to get all the ladies who don't like Barbie on board so they went way over the top on the ""patriarchy"" at the expense of a real plot and good writing. So many cringe moments (the dancing Kens, Barbie turning into real person, the weird montage at the end) that just didn't make sense. Too bad, a good writer could have made this movie poignant, clever, funny and fun to watch. Instead, the script just pondered.<br><br>Other reviewers pointed out the ripped off plot lines (Wizard of Oz, Pinocchio, Velveteen Rabbit).<br><br>The one funny moment was Gosling serenading Barbie on the beach.",3
" Funny and Creative
","The voice over commentary in some parts had me laughing to no end. Most of the Will Ferrel scenes I could have been edited out, they were too campy and distracted from the rest of the movie, fortunately they were few and resigned to the later 1/3 of the movie.<br><br>To be honest I missed most of the big name actors, however Rhea Perlman was spot on perfect in her role.<br><br>Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling were excellent as well, with Ryan giving an overtop hammy performance that allowed Margo to shine as the epitome of what Barbie represents, future possibilities.<br><br>Kate McKinnon was well cast and delivered flawlessly.<br><br>A couple scenes were overplayed.<br><br>As a moderately middle-aged man I might have laughed a little to hard in some places. It was well worth seeing, so much so that I even dressed up as 80s fashion Ken when I went.",8
" Why do people seem to enjoy this?
","The first part of the movie and all the other scenes set in Barbie-land were a huge sensory overload for me. Everything is violently colorful, things happen super fast and everyone is screaming in a strange voice while trying to outscream each other. This Barbie-land is supposed to be a super joyful place but honestly it just made me nauseous. At this point I was praying for it to be over and had a really hard time following what's going on.<br><br>It gets better when they arrive in the real word, but I seriously don't get why people call it ""deep"" and ""philosophical"" because most of the dialouge is cliché at best and at times it's absolute cringe. It tries real hard to deal with serious topics but keeps explaining things like you're a 5-year-old.<br><br>Emotions are also portrayed a super weird way in this movie (I guess because we're dealing with dolls, but still, sometimes this level of over-acting just hurts to watch), and a lot of things happen randomly without any explanation. It's also not for (small) kids. There were a lot of really small kids in the cinema when I went and most of them were super confused with some even crying, it was clear they couldn't really follow the plot and didn't get most of the supposed jokes.",1
" Exceeded my high expectations
","I bought into the marketing hype and boy did this movie deliver! It was smart, funny, charismatic, visually pleasing and touching!<br><br>It was both a perfect social commentary on the world today from a place of empathy and understanding for both men and women. From some haters online I thought it was going to be overly feminist (which I have no problem with) but I think it perfectly expressed how patriarchy is detrimental for men as well as women.<br><br>But more importantly it was hilarious. Kate McKinnon stole the show, but the acting was solid all around. Really excited to see what Greta Gerwig does next-I heard this movie just surpassed $1Billion-the results speak for themselves.",10
" Not what I expected
","Originally when I went into the cinema my expectations were quite low however I was pleasantly surprised. Everything from the set, the dances, the music, the costumes and the actors were phenomenal. Credit to Ryan Gosling, he fulfilled his role as Ken so well and his interactions with Margot Robbie were top notch. I loved the amount of secret cameos that went into when making this movie. This piece of media will go down in history as it has been so well done and the message(s) in it were very much prevalent. I couldn't be happier, I adore this movie and I cannot wait to watch it again at home.",10
" Pretty good
","I have watched barbie since I was born, I've collected the dolls the dresses and many other barbie themed things. I know all the movies by heart and the songs and I love barbie so when I saw this movies trailer and the marketing I went crazy!! I was so excited to watch it and support this movie.<br><br>The beginning of the movie was quite fun and funny, very colorful. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their roles so well and really carry the movie. It contained all the things expected from a barbie movie. The plot was great but halfway through the movie it becomes very serious and turns a bit preachy so if you want to take your kids to the movies to watch this, Id suggest not doing so because I don't think they'll understand much about patriarchy and sexism, its definitely not aimed at younger children (12 and below).<br><br>I was hoping for some more funny moments and homage to the barbie movies so I was a tad bit disappointed not to see it however it was still a nice movie, enjoyable and a feel good movie.<br><br>I understand the message given out that you can be whoever you want to be but it could have been slightly more light hearted .",8
" A Peculiar Mix of Satire and Puzzling Political Agenda
","Barbie starts off with a promising blend of satire and clever dialogue, but as the story transitions into the real world, the film becomes tiresome and less captivating. Like oil and water, it attempts to provide entertainment but is hindered by heavy-handed messages. It is not your typical children's film; instead, it feels more like a production geared towards teenagers, laden with political propaganda and mockery of traditional values.<br><br>The film seems intent on conveying a manifesto against a cruel and unrealistic reality while addressing the existential crisis faced by women. However, for male viewers like myself, the film feels peculiar and confusing due to its irrelevant and comical political undertones.<br><br>It also appears to take on the role of a feminist campaign, attempting to portray women as equal to men through ironic and puzzling means. Unfortunately, some of the intended messages get lost in translation and lack proper delivery. The perplexing ending, where Barbie's creator claims she can choose her destiny, as if referring to a tragedy as a gift, only adds to the overall confusion and lack of clarity regarding Barbie's origins.<br><br>Perhaps with the addition of more appropriate dialogue, this plastic doll movie could have been an enjoyable watch, instead of morphing into a misguided attempt to indoctrinate children with politics.",5
" Loved It!
","Very light spoilers.<br><br>I didn't go into this movie thinking I would love it as much as I did. I went because I have 9 and 6 year old girls and especially the youngest loves Barbie. There were definitely jokes that were not appropriate for them but went right over their head, but they very much enjoyed the movie.<br><br>The message was great and Ryan Gosling stole the show as a dopey Ken. Margot was great as Barbie, as were all of the actresses who played Barbies. I especially loved America Ferrera in her role! She was great.<br><br>There were many times I cried in this movie because it's so on the nose about being a woman today, and it hit me hard having two young girls. I did not expect to shed any tears so that was a surprise!<br><br>The reason I gave this an 8 instead of a 10 is because there were definitely some plot holes, like why Barbie had to bring America and her daughter to Barbie Land and what the very bad thing that would happen was (per the execs) by Barbie leaving the Barbie world. Many things weren't explained or didn't make much sense, but it was still a joy to watch.<br><br>Overall I loved the movie and I'm so glad we went. All women should see this movie.",8

Don't really recomend.<br><br>It's good in the beginning and the experience it's not terrible, don't like the fact it's too long and you end up getting bored. Ken plays a role but it's overly complicated and annoying don't really know how this is rated as a good movie. Most like a 5/10 movie that you shouldn't watch at the cinema.<br><br>Finally don't enjoy watching it at the big screen, RX and other cinematography was mid and don't look like a worth it movie to watch or invest time and money.",2
" A Mind Trip of a Film
","Expertly written, perfectly plastic visually, with a strong thematic mix of The Matrix and The Wizard of Oz. BUT! It very much made me think of late career comedy specials from George Carlin; not as fun as expected, but there are zero flaws in the logic of the message.<br><br>So many little nuances that pull you into the well crafted universe bit by bit. The added touch of there being multiple Barbies and Ken's that are not differentiated by name was genius. It may make it somewhat difficult to discuss the slight differences between the characters, but so what?<br><br>I just hope they don't make a sequel.

","I think the significance of Barbie wasn't the fact that it was a fun, joyous, all around well movie. I felt everything. From the point being that women to this day hold such little power. You can't want to be skinny you need to want to be healthy. You need to show off but not too much. Nothing you'll ever do will be perfect to anyone in power. But along with this it brings up the fact that emotions are something everyone can experience and that it's okay, you can be emotional and logical at the same time. It's okay to not know if what you're doing is right. I won't ever know if I was made to do what I want to do. Am I supposed to be an astronaut? Is that what my purpose is? I feel lazy when I see that everyone is out having amazing times and I'm stuck in the same continuous loop. Literally, everything that can make me me isn't actually me at all and the thought scares me. In our world, we want and fight for power yet nothing ever comes of it. And this movie is the most beautiful way to showcase all of the world and what women truly do go through.",10

" Amazing film!
","Truthfully, after seeing this film once, I did not realize just how many gems there are in it. Everything in the movie is representative of something else. It is more than just literal. For eg. Barbie was not into Ken as we are accustomed to because her owner did not have a Ken doll. The adding on of the character Ruth gave so much life to this movie. This one was definitely dedicated to women. As a girl, if you haven't seen it, I would recommend you go as soon as you can. It is especially empowering to young girls because it truly shows the essence of a woman. The trailer was not enough to capture the beauty of this movie. It was definitely more than what I expected. I completely understand why anyone would think that the men were portrayed as 'dumb' (obviously in the real world, men aren't as bad as the movie makes it seem) but I think what was meant to come from this movie was a deeper message, and this may have been necessary to really capture what the movie was trying to portray for all women. It was needed to emphasize the movie so to speak.",9
" Extremely disappointed
","I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Barbie, but this was bad. An awful plot with some very unnecessary sequences, and it feels far too preachy to be an enjoyable movie. There is a good movie in there somewhere, but it is buried underneath unnecessary characters and preachy dialogue. I personally would not recommend watching this in theaters, if I hadn't been watching it with my friends (so that we could joke about how bad it was) I would have felt that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. Of course, maybe this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Other than the poor plot, I thought that the acting was done reasonably well, about what you would expect with the cast of the movie, and there were a few funny moments sprinkled in there as well.",3
" Meaningful and interesting movie😋
","Barbie is a very good start movie-try to popularize the feminism idea to normal people. Many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea. After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw ""Let me show you"" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up.",10
" Funny, Poignant, Wonderful Music, and Unpredictable Right Up to the End
","A few of my friends saw the movie and really liked it so I gave it a try tonight and was pleasantly surprised. This movie is one of a kind. I've had mixed feelings about Margot Robbie but she delivered a wonderful performance. She was perfect as a life-sized version of the iconic doll. Helen Mirren's narration was well-paced, not overly-intrusive, and she dryly delivered a line that resulted in the audience erupting into laughter as I am sure we were all thinking the same thing as Margot was delivering a touching monolog about 3/4 through the film. The entire cast clicked: Ryan Gosling can play just about any role and his portrayal of Ken is another notch on his belt of challenging, versatile, and memorable performances. Kate McKinnon nailed her part and if there is such a thing as perfect casting, she was perfectly cast. I wanted to present an Academy Award to. America Ferrera when she finished her heartfelt reflection of what it is like to be a woman these days. Finally, the music was brilliantly matched to the mood of the film. I didn't expect the music to be so wonderful and it went a long way to infusing an emotional essence into what otherwise may have come across as a technicolor cartoonish fantasy. I want to see this movie at least one more time in a theater. There was so much going on, I know I missed some things.",8
" Fun movie
",I liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it. I did think the feminism was a little too 'on the nose' sometimes. But it's difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences. Overall it was a job well done. The set was beautiful and everything expected from a Barbie movie. Simu Liu and Ryan Gosling were showstealers as rivalling Kens and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast. I was also really surprised that the slogan 'a movie for people who love Barbie and people who hate Barbie' caught the essence. They didn't shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the Barbie dolls and Mattel as a company.,8
" Bad Bad Barbie
","This was really bad and boring. Very pandering and toxic feminine and it should have been about equality. Barbie is just not what I expected it to be. I would like if it was better and that people would save their money. Not worth it trust me, I cannot recommend.<br><br>While the sets were decent, I was hoping it would end and be over soon and then I looked at my watch there was still an entire hour left.<br><br>I thought about leaving and sneaking into Oppenheimer instead but alas I was with my family and they would have noticed. Just absolutely boring for both kids and adults, it should have been more about the fun Barbie Land and not so dramatic.<br><br>Overall, cringe as hell and just boring while missing the mark. Men and women are equal and that is that.<br><br>Good night.",1
" Worry about the folks that call this movie an ""easy watch""
","I watched this movie in the theater 9 weeks after its release. When the crowd of the Barbenheimer made its exit safely, it was time for me to move in, not dressed in pink -none of the 6 of us in the audience was- and watch it away from the hype.<br><br>And boy was I grateful I did.<br><br>Because the herds of my mid thirties, millennial peers that saw it before me, were hyped about the nostalgia of being a girl again. They also singlemindedly agreed that this movie is such a ""feel good movie"".<br><br>And it is, if you ignore the sharp societal commentary, the self-criticism on mass consumerism and capitalist dogma our society is based upon, the sexes are seeking validation from, and at the end of the day, our relationship with ourselves and anyone around us is defined. Sure, womanhood and manhood are not deeply portrayed in this pink firework, after all, one of Ken's first lines is that pining whisper of ""i love you too"" whilst she waltzes off in her matriarchal utopia. After all, "" Thanks to Barbie, all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved"".<br><br>Gloria's monologue can easily go above your head if the pretty dresses and perfect hairdos are flashing in front of your eyes. It's understandable not wanting to listen to her sum of woman's existence in a couple of minutes, to the point that it felt like a knife to the gut and I was trying to control my sobs.<br><br>I am sorry. This is not a feel good movie. Greta Gerwig is holding up a mirror to all of us and points the finger of accountability. This movie will age as a fine wine and it will be as timeless as Barbie's last line that defines the origins of us all.",9
" Genuinely disappointed and disgusted.
","This movie was awful and definitely not kid friendly. It turned a beautiful childhood toy and turned it into a horrid mess. It wasnt funny or entertaining. Any hope for entertainment was lost immediately. Any innocence that was held by barbie was quickly abandoned by the creators. The fact that mattel allowed for such sexual references and cursing is truly beyond me. Yes this is supposed to be barbie going to the real world and figuring out how life actually is, however it could have been done in a way where what she stands for was gracefully held intact. Instead of letting barbie go into the real world and face independence as she stands for instead of gross references to genitalia would be a start for a better movie.",2
" a gift to this generation
","For a movie about a line of plastic dolls, it managed to be the most deeply human movie to come out in a while. I've don't think that I've walked out of theater at the end of a movie with the feeling of so much solidarity with the folks around me and I'm already trying to make a plan for seeing it again in theaters.<br><br>From the huge amount of artists work that went into making intricate sets that had the feeling of big Broadway ensemble stage pieces to the soundtrack, I can't say enough good things about this movie. Go see it, take your teenagers or your mom, but Greta Gerwig went and made something really special.",10

","The plot is interesting enough to make you feel interested and intrigued even if you're not a barbie fan or just not a fan of cliches, it has a beautiful meaning behind it and it's the best movie for you to watch if you're a woman . This movie is great , i usually don't watch movies with high hopes but i did with this one and still it surprised me . The marketing crew did an insanely perfect job , the hole mall was wearing pink and it helped people on building the hype for the movie.

Teared up a few times and would have definitely full on cried if I was home alone while watching the movie.<br><br>Ryan Gosling was so good at playing Ken and making the audience laugh at him, laugh with him, feel bad for him, get mad at him, and understand him.<br><br>Margot Robbie is just overall the perfect Barbie.",8
" Witty and entertaining film with great performances which will successfully line Mattel exec's pockets while subtly setting back 50 years
","This movie had so much potential!! It was doing so well for a while, it was funny and clever and had depth and I was super excited to see where it was going to go, but then it just became disappointing with a really underwhelming and incoherent (even problematic) conclusion. I'm almost angry at it. Even pure shallow entertainment would have been better than planting all these seeds, making you believe they will grow into something and then just letting them die.<br><br>Btw it's definitely not for under 12s. There is nothing inappropriate in it, so they could technically watch it for the visual aspect, they just wouldn't understand much.<br><br>------ SPOILERS ------<br><br>Some of the elements where the movie deeply disappointed me are below. Please don't read any further if you haven't watched the film yet and want these elements to be a surprise.<br><br>Ken's development:<br><br>Ken realises that men aren't treated as equals in Barbieland, and creates his own patriarchy, which in the end the Barbies tear down. When Ken bursts into tears thinking that he will have to go back to a life where he is oppressed - that could have been developed and executed so beautifully! Barbie even told him it's ok to cry. This could have moved towards all Kens understanding that they need to express their vulnerable emotions in order to not be angry and toxic, and the Barbies need to stop the oppression of men because it's just as bad as oppressing anyone, and it could have led to equality in Barbieland! But no. Turns out Ken is in fact crying because he has an unhealthy, anxious attachment to Barbie and his ego can't take the news that Barbie is not 'in love' with him. And then the movie concludes with Ken agreeing to explore who he is individually without Barbie (this would be an ok conclusion if it wasn't for abandoning all the other deeper seeds planted before), with some other Kens getting middle management jobs in the (once again) matriarchal Barbieland society, but not leadership positions, 'the same way it is for women in the real world'. Seriously? It's like this was written by men. The Barbies are going for revenge??<br><br>Barbie's development:<br><br>Barbie wants to be human, and again this could have been developed with emotional and intellectual depth, and there is an attempt at the beginning to show the reason Barbie started to have these thoughts, where she is seeing humans express all these complex emotions, and she's seeing the beauty of the world around her in all those small magical details in nature that feel more intense than usual, but then this thread is dropped completely, so much so that in the end when Barbie is asking to be human, it doesn't make sense why, and the narrator has to literally do a voiceover speech to explain it (badly). And then when she is finally human, her first (and very overhyped) trip is to the gynaecologist, implying that what she's most excited about being human is having a vagina. Again, written by men?? This movie is literally setting women back 50 years.<br><br>Development of the mother - daughter relationship:<br><br>Not much to say other than how shallow this remains despite setting it up as if it was going to go somewhere. Barbie goes to the real world to find this teenage girl whose emotions are causing her to malfunction (the malfunctioning focused on cellulite which is a whole other horror story!) It then turns out it's actually the girl's mum who is playing with Barbie and feeling these emotions because her life isn't fun and her daughter is hostile with her. And then at some point out of nowhere the mother and daughter start hugging and smiling at each other. That's it. We're not going into why she was hostile in the first place and why she isn't any more (teenagers are not hostile for no reason), we're not touching on why the mum was feeling that way and what made her not feel that way any more (it clearly wasn't just her daughter). But everything is suddenly fine now. Oh ok then.<br><br>Allan:<br><br>This is so chaotic, I don't even know where to start. So he has a particularly sensitive / gay / queer vibe, and I think they are trying to make him into a hero (like he fights a bunch of Kens for no apparent reason - they really could have used that scene for something else), but the point of him is unclear. He's an ally to the Barbies, and there's only one of him (which I always think is actually a bit problematic, to have only one token representative of the LGBTQ+ community in a film; although I get that in real life Mattel didn't have that much diversity and they were trying to stay true to that). His motivation siding with the Barbies in the patriarchy seems to be the fact that he feels invisible too, but the movie doesn't go into this at all, and kind of ignores him the same way the characters do. Like he's a hero simply by being different from the Kens and helping the Barbies, but how he feels throughout this, and what he gets out of it in the end, if anything, is anyone's guess. It's not clear whether or how things change for him at all. They don't seem to, despite all the effort.<br><br>'Weird' Barbie:<br><br>When Barbies are played with too hard, they turn 'weird' - strange make up and clothes, cut and messed up hair, always in splits. So far, very funny. But why does 'Weird' Barbie remain perceived weird throughout?? Why doesn't anyone realise that she is just as beautiful still as the other Barbies, despite her unusual hair and make-up and non-perfection, or why doesn't anyone realise that she basically saves Barbieland, and it doesn't matter in the slightest what she looks like, she's a hero? Thanks for making all girls who are unusual-looking or not stereotypically beautiful and perfect feel like freaks.<br><br>Especially because of 'Weird' Barbie and Allan, the movie's 'diversity' just feels so forced.<br><br>The board of Mattel (all real world men who are painfully stupid):<br><br>With Will Farrell as CEO. First of all, what was funny 20 years ago is not really funny any more. Will Farrell should only be in this if there is some clear development of the narrative behind his behaviour. But there isn't. It's all a bit of a mess. We get a kick out of the mockery of foolish men at the beginning, but they are still in power regardless of anything. They are trying to put Barbie back in a box but she escapes (another missed opportunity - what would have happened if she goes in the box?), then they chase her into Barbieland for no reason (they wanted her to go back, she goes back, so why don't they just celebrate and stay where they are?), and then there's literally no point of them being there. Was casting Will Farrell just an attempt to get middle aged toxic men into the cinema?<br><br>The cellulite issue:<br><br>Barbie agrees to go to the real world so that she doesn't get cellulite. Literally. I do understand sarcasm and I get that this would be quite funny IF we as a society were beyond that already and IF there weren't any teenage girls watching but the film is a 12 and the beauty industry is making more money out of women's insecurities now than ever. If we're going to use sarcasm here, this needs to be addressed later, for example Barbie realising that it's our uniqueness that makes us beautiful (they really missed an opportunity using 'Weird' Barbie to drive that message) and cellulite doesn't matter, but no such thing - the movie concludes with the message that cellulite is indeed a malfunction. This has got to have been written by men.<br><br>Apparently the only man involved in the screenplay was Noah Baumbach. Ah, co-produced by Mattel. Of course. All the male Mattel executives must have had a say. Now it makes sense. The movie is fun to watch and it's certainly witty, especially in the first half, and I really liked the performances and visuals. There seems to have been strong intention of depth and the movie is very political but ultimately fails to convey the right message and all it ends up being is a clever brand extension to make more money for Mattel.",2
" Impactful.
","I think Barbie is one of the most powerful movies to impact the world! Portraying men as the women in todays society and American culture is brilliant to me. It's movies like this that will teach the young how unfair the world is and that's okay! The sooner we can help bring equality to the country, like it was made for, the sooner we can learn to help each other. I will say it's a shame Greta wasn't able to do things her way because I feel like it was very apparent how much the story changed midway, but either way It was a sweet message to every girl and their mothers, an acknowledgement to the struggles women face that men have little to no idea about. I really loved this movie and all the little allegories they used.",10
" A decent comedy ruined by explanatory philosophy and bad movie features
","Barbie is a philosophical movie with a lot of messages. The huge problem was just that they told us too much about every message; it was too explanatory. Philosophical films should let the viewers think and reflect, not explain all the messages in detail. I think the reason they do it is because they'll have many kids watching who might not understand everything; the film really treated us all as kids in this sense. This really ruined the vibe.<br><br>It's not about the messages in general, which a lot of negative reviews talk about; it's about how they're presented. I think that the film had great potential and messages, but they were all sadly ruined.<br><br>Comedies like Barbie are overproduced and very average. For the most part, it's a funny movie, and I laughed a lot, but it's very far from a great comedy.<br><br>Furthermore, Barbie has a lot of movie features and clichés that are extremely overused in the film industry. Because of this, it really felt like I was watching a movie, which made me come back to reality. This is a big no-no!<br><br>Overall, it was a decent movie with high highs and low lows.<br><br>Solid 5/10.<br><br>William Gurebo,

I thought the whole point in society is for us to be equal, not to condemn either gender or portay either gender as ruling society, like why does the male gender not own houses, why are they portayed as disposable and not taken into account, and it the end, they still don't get houses? Also this is a misrepresentation of the real world, as a woman with a career and decent income, I can tell you I in fact have more privilege than some of my male colleagues.

It's all very musical-like untill Barbie asks the question about dying which can be seen in trailer.<br><br>The movie slowly starts to take itself more seriously and when Barbie goes to the ""Real World"" she faces problems that modern woman has. Ken also has to face the ""Real World"" but does it in his own way. It was very cool seeing two characters detached from reality and having completely different view on the world face the ""reality"" and carry themselves with it. It makes the characters more fleshed out which the movie does well, as i've got a feeling that Barbie and Ken in particular are behaving just how they were imagined to since they were first made.<br><br>Time and Change are factors that are actually displayed through small cameos and at the ending itself, but have a very important meaning and are factors that should be thought about after you watch the movie.<br><br>Ultimately, the ""agenda"" goes from funny jokes to actual rants towards the end of the movie but it all comes a full circle and sends a strong message.<br><br>The music and cinematography are very cartoonish and nice, so is the dialogue. The references to other media are very cleverly put throughout the movie as well. The dialogue at the beginning is made to look like kids actually playing with those dolls but facing the reality is actually a very good space for character development, and Barbie used that very good. Even tho some ""agendas"" are pushed throughout the movie, it ultimately sends a good message, and does what Barbie is supposed to do : to inspire girls and make them feel strong for who they are.",8
" Unfortunately, too much politics
","The comedy was ok at times. Otherwise, this movie has a modern political agenda, and this is probably one of the reasons why it is highly rated. I understand the need for awareness of women's rights, possibilities, and freedom. It's here even in the 21st century, especially in some countries. However, I'm not sure if movies like this could succeed in giving the good message, or make it even worse, as sometimes the movie is disgustingly misandrous. Not to say that the overall experience of the content was not like a movie, but more of a parody of a movie. I love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but this piece is definitely overrated.",3
" Thank you
","Thank you for this movie ! It's beautiful by the décor, costumes and music, but so much more beautiful with the message. We do need that kind of movie in our world.<br><br>People (men, lol) seems to be confused after seeing the Barbie movie. Maybe it's time to accept the world as it is now and understand how cruel it could be for the half of the world population. I think you are proving the point of the movie.<br><br>We do need more movies like Barbie, that can keep the funny in important messages. In many movies, they need violence, rudeness and/or vulgarity to show how the female character is in pain. Thanks to Barbie, we don't have to see this to know, we don't have to be triggered to understand what kind of feelings she is going through. Barbie is like us. Barbie is for us. Thank you, Barbie !",10
" Great movie! Plot issues..but it's a movie about barbies
","""Barbie,"" the film, is an enchanting cinematic experience that is sure to entertain viewers of all ages. It's a vibrant and delightful exploration into the world of one of the most enduring and iconic dolls ever created. Its storyline is compelling and keeps you engaged throughout, making it a truly wonderful movie.<br><br>What makes the movie stand out is its successful use of humor and adventure that ensures it isn't just another kids movie, but a family affair where adults can also derive enjoyment. Furthermore, the movie is brimming with fun characters that each add a unique flair to the narrative.<br><br>A major highlight of the film is the character of Ken. He isn't merely a supporting role, but emerges as a real scene-stealer. Ken's charisma and witty dialogue delivery is splendid, adding a new layer to his character that audiences are sure to appreciate. His performance has a certain charm that makes you look forward to his scenes. Indeed, he truly stole the show.<br><br>Despite the largely engaging narrative, the movie does come with a few plot holes. At times, the story lacks logic, and there are certain developments that seem a bit rushed or inadequately explained. However, considering that the movie is based on the universe of Barbie, where the rules of reality are often bent, these plot holes can be somewhat expected and forgivable.<br><br>In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an entertaining and heartwarming film that successfully captures the essence of its source material. Its flaws are minor and largely overshadowed by its vibrant characters, engaging narrative, and a particularly standout performance by Ken. Even with some plot holes, it's a cinematic treat that offers plenty of enjoyment for both kids and adults.",10
" Great comedy with a positive message
","Didn't know what to expect... was pleasantly surprised. Clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the US. Liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society. Was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle, sticking together, through intelligence, compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure. It encouraged acceptance of people with differences, people that don't look like you and challenged the battles over ""what's feminine"" or ""what's masculine"" (after all Barbie and Ken have no genitals).",10
" Disgusting
","Super boring movie. It has a poor plot and everything is a cliche. The Barbie movie I watched recently left a lot to be desired. The plot felt cliché and predictable, lacking any real depth or originality. The characters were one-dimensional and failed to engage my interest. Additionally, the story quality was subpar, making it difficult to fully immerse myself in the world they were trying to create. Overall, I was disappointed with the lackluster storytelling and uninspiring execution of the movie.<br><br>Why is there so much hype about this movie. Please don't watch this movie, please. It's pathetic!!",1
" Fun . . . and much more complicated than it appears
","I laughed a lot! I even teared up a few times. I felt a bit uncomfortable a couple of times.<br><br>When I first heard about this movie, I couldn't have been less than enthusiastic. In fact, I thought it sounded like a waste of time and money and I kept wondering ""Why???"" Then the movie came out and I had to pay attention. I decided to see a morning showing while my dogs were being groomed and I'm so glad I did!<br><br>Barbie is fun. It's also a movie for adults and I believe children could be entertained by the sets and costumes . . . But, the story is more mature and complicated. It could have gone in the direction of ludicrous and absurd. This is where I'm going to give kudos to Greta Gerwig for her writing and direction.<br><br>Margot Robbie is excellent, but the scene stealer is Ryan Gosling. I hope some day they will release a short film of the outtakes. I can't imagine this movie wasn't plagued by characters loosing focus and cracking each up or having blunders with props.<br><br>Well done! A great escape!",9
" Bring a pillow - I challenge you to stay awake for the duration of this movie
","Barbie is a complete snooze fest.<br><br>This movie felt like a self indulgent Saturday Night Live sketch that didn't go anywhere. The humour is predictable and forced, so it starts to induce eye rolling as the movie progresses. This movie had a distinctive feel of ""in jokes"" between the cast and the movie makers - but they audience aren't included in the joke.... So we don't care<br><br>It's not remotely entertaining, it's extremely disappointing to see such a waste of talented actors in this overhyped, shiny piece of rubbish.<br><br>The actresses all work hard with the poor script they have to work with. Margot Robbie commits to the character and she trys to make it work.<br><br>Ryan Goslings opportunity to pull off a dramatic turn in the final scenes falls flat and feels like a very amateur performance.<br><br>Will Ferrell has his place in the comedy movie genre but we've seen it all before, so the performance just becomes irritating.<br><br>I wouldn't bother bringing the kids to it, they'll be bored out of their minds.<br><br>Hyped up for a reason, save your money and go to something else. 👎🏻",1
" A thoughtful blockbuster
","Last year I was appointed to a department hiring committee for an important position. When a colleague asked me who else was on the committee, she scoffed at the gender composition. Even though our department is half women, the hiring committee was nearly all men. I hadn't noticed until she mentioned it. What else don't I notice?<br><br>According to the philosopher Richard Rorty, art is better at changing minds than argument, because it allows the audience to see through someone else's eyes and empathize. In the Barbie movie, shortly after he arrives in the real world, Ken takes a walk through Century City in Los Angeles. Among the skyscrapers there are men in business suits, and a guy exiting a gym nods at him. A couple of guys jump out of a hummer, and policemen ride by on horses. A woman assistant is shushed by businessmen in important discussion. Finally there is a montage of men -- US presidents, movie stars, sports stars, stock traders, Mount Rushmore, and the portraits on US currency. Ken realizes that, unlike in Barbie's world, men hold the power in the real world. Ken learns to sing the 1996 Matchbox 20 hit Push, featuring the lyrics, ""I want to push your around, and I will, and I will."" When the song came out, it was my freshman year in high school. I must have heard it hundreds of times, but I never noticed that the lyrics hinted at violence against the singer's love interest. The film made me notice specific parts of American culture which I had absorbed growing up without thinking, and which reinforced the idea that men have the power in society.<br><br>The film will work best for an American audience. Not only would it had hit less hard if I hadn't been forced to reevaluate the messages underlying parts of the culture I grew up with, but another wonderful aspect of the film was its send-ups of American films and popular music. The opening to 2001 is ported into the wonderful first minutes of the film. A bit later, a character makes Barbie choose between continuing her fantasy life (represented by a stilleto) and learning the truth (a birkenstock sandel). There is a great musical tribute to Take on Me (I know, a-ha is Norwegian, but it was a US hit!), and a power ballad that reminded me of Free Bird. Later in the film, Ken wears a faux mink coat that I'm sure I've seen on Logan Paul. I must have missed many more.<br><br>It is surprising that Mattel signed off on the film, since it does a good job of presenting the good, the bad, and the weird of Barbie over the years. While she started out in a swimsuit, Barbies were sold in the getup of just about every profession. Girls could play with Barbie the surgeon, Barbie the scientist, or Barbie the politician, and maybe imagine themselves in those traditionally male roles. On the other hand, a teenage character points out that Barbie has given unrealistic body and beauty ideals to generations of women, and that Barbie promotes unhealthy consumer culture with all of her outfits and accessories. If nothing else, the color profile of Barbie is pink and glittery. The weird are all the discontinued barbies -- including ""Growing Up Skipper"", a doll with inflatable breasts.<br><br>I nicked one star because of the constant product placement and the milquetoast feel-good ending. That said, the movie is worth your time. After years of copy-paste superhero movies and CGI spectacles, the Barbie movie gives me hope for a future of more thoughtful Hollywood blockbusters.",9
" Exactly what i expected? NO even better!!
","I am in my late thirties, i had many Barbie's when growning up (still have a lot of them stored away, maybe it's time to get them out) and when i heard a Barbie movie was being made, i was like not another dumb remake that will fail like so many money grabs nowadays.<br><br>But then i saw that one of my fave actresses, Margot Robbie, was going to portray Barbie herself, i was like wow maybe this could work?<br><br>Then i saw the teaser, i was blowm away by all the bright colors, beautiful decors and mostly so happy there was NO and i mean NO CGI of any kind in sight, i was like YES please, i NEED to watch this ASAP.<br><br>So when the movie finally came out, it was even better then expected, i love the storyline, i love the interactions between Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, i love that there ar so many different Barbie's representing so many body types, cultures and you can truly be anyone you want to be, like in this movie.<br><br>So long story short, with not to many details, why should you watch this Barbie movie? Well it's just pure nostalgia meets modern day issues meets female empowerment.<br><br>Not for all ages though given the nature of the story, i would say from 10 years and up, its oke to watch.",9
" Mile-a-minute laughs, but with a message.
","From the get-go, Barbie hits hard with its spectacle and wit. The movie literally starts and ends itself in quips. But make no mistake, there is purpose and feeling to the film. It presents its core message boldly around its character's struggles, and subtly beneath its self-referential humor.<br><br>I could best describe Barbie as the inaugural Marvel movie of Greta-Gerwig-involved projects. It has a fantastic ensemble all-star cast with added cameos you never saw coming. Dazzling VFX and detailed practical set pieces bring life to the most plastic aspects of Barbieland. At several points it not just breaks the fourth wall, but blows through it altogether. There is no moment where it won't reset your expectation about what will come next.<br><br>There are definitely characters and relationships I would have liked to see explored more in-depth in the film. Regardless, Barbie will send you home with a profound motivation to re-explore who you are, where you're headed, who you want to be.",9
" Rubbish
",Watched it at home yesterday. In the first 30 minutes it was boring and then it became dreadful and unwatchable. It is sooooo mediocre that I don't understand what was going through the minds of those involved in it. How did this seem good is beyond me. What happened to cinematography? How did we come to this insufferable mess? Where is the fun is this? It is a movie so stupid with no meaning at all. Nothing that happens has a meaning. Why the characters do what they do makes no sense. How did they write the script and thought it was good? How could everyone who read the script not understand how pathetic it was? This is not a movie. This is a failing attempt to make a movie but they definitely achieved everything they could with the marketing strategy. Stupid senseless piece of garbage.,1
" A social problem.
","The film not only talks about the role of women in society, but also about how men are affected by the behavior and criticism of this repressed society full of hatred and misunderstanding. Both genders in real life suffer discrimination and minimization in labor fields, parental roles, etc. And this is something the movie makes mention of, but one has to be a bit more picky and watch the movie several times to understand the real message of the movie. About the humor, it's okay, but at times it can feel a bit fierce out of place, not to call it forced.<br><br>About its music, the film has several pieces, but they're not able to shine, as well as the movie itself, and just a few like ""What was I made for"", or ""Dance the night away"" are remembered out of all the film has to offer.",8
" Only the beginning was fun
","I was looking forward to watch this movie and now I am severely disappointed. The first ten minutes was the best part, and I took me to the days where I had my dolls.<br><br>Even as I am writing this review , I wonder why this movie was so underwhelming.<br><br>I wish the story was better told, as soon as I left the Theater the movie was forgotten.<br><br>And I think they will go for part 2 😒.<br><br>Anyways, you must see it to make up your mind , there was a few nicely done comic relief moments that were great. Anyways , Ken is a big character in this movie , I felt much more liking for his character and his reasons were understandable.<br><br>Go watch it and have your childhood moments revived .",5
" You don't have to love Barbies to love this movie and identify with it
","I'm not a Barbie fan girl in the least, but I think this has become one of those movies I will cherish. Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them ""weak"" or ""stupid"" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I'm pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel's past.",10
" Amazing movie, by an outstanding director and breathtaking performers
","(let me apologize for my english beforehand)
Oh my gosh... I don't even know where to start. I was very exited to watch this movie, and I decided to go see it for the first time with my best friend with whom I used to play barbies. However, I did not expected the movie to be so emotional: I cried in four different moments. In particular, the scene with the eldery woman on the bench makes me cry everytime I think about it! This movie touches a lot of parts about womanhood that we rearly get to see on the big screen, it critizes and in someways explains the patriarchy in a vey obvious way, whitch makes me think that the (mostly) men who are complaining about it have probably seen the movie with their eyes closed.<br><br>Please, girls, go watch it with a woman you love, that makes you feel safe and let you be you, because this is an experience that needs to be shared with other women.<br><br>It's one of the saddest movie I've ever seen, but somehow it filled me with hope. Now I'll go back crying about this movie while listening to ""what was i made for"" lol.",10
" It's a great film except for one thing
","What a wildly ambitious, near perfectly executed piece of cinema. Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and company have made one wildly entertaining film. It's both mainstream and experimental, overtly political and intensely silly, sentimental and satirical, heavy and light, and hoo boy is it ever beautiful. It never stops entertaining.<br><br>Like this year's other great original film, ""Oppenheimer"" it deserves being seen at least once on a big screen so you can appreciate it as the artistic masterpiece it is. There is so much going on in the details, both in the ""Real World"" and ""Barbieland"" sections.<br><br>And that last line and Robbie's delivery of it? Killer.<br><br>There is just one fly in the ointment. That fly has a name, Will Farrell. I like Will Farrell when he's centered in the movie. But here he's doing his ""Will Farrell, Silly Man"" schtick and disrupts the flow. I think it would have been interesting to see Brad Pitt or Ben Stiller (in slow burn mode) or maybe even John Cleese in the role Farrell plays.",9
" Great cast but not the movie I was expecting
","I had high hopes due to cast and some of the reviews but definitely this is not my cup of tea. I didn't find movie entertaining, everything shouldn't be about political and social statements, some time you just want plain good movie.<br><br>Worst part is by looking at name Barbie you are just expecting something light and fun but movie is completely opposite of that, in light and fun wrapper it is full of strong messages which I was not expecting.<br><br>By reading the reviews I can see lot of people like the movie so definitely there is a demand but for me it was not fun and it felts like I had wasted couple hours of my life which I would never get back.",2
" Barbie a very inclusive film
","Have you watched Barbie?<br><br>Yes I am talking about the SMASH movie that topped the global box office, broke records and made 1 BILLION dollars in just 17 days...<br><br>We watched the movie recently and couldn't help but think that the success was anything BUT coincidental...<br><br>This is the most successful movie directed by a woman, EVER<br><br>It champions intersectional feminism showing a world where:<br><br>1. Black women can be presidents
2. Trans women can be doctors
3. Disabled women can dance and join the party
4. Plus size women can be desired
5. Mature women can mentor, encourage and support younger women
6. Men can be allies and support women's causes<br><br>What I also loved is that the movie showed that:<br><br>1. Men can find happiness when they decide to be themselves, rather who society expects them to be
2. You can still be a man and cry and love yourself and support others without having to fight and ""prove"" your masculinity
3. Women don't need men to be happy and vice versa
4. There's beauty in the mundane and everyday experiences, such as going to the doctor<br><br>It is obvious that the team behind this movie was incredibly diverse.<br><br>You can see diversity of thought and willingness to include different people, and groups, in almost every scene!!! ... WOW !<br><br>Diversity &amp; Inclusion is not just the right, and ethical thing, for every company to do, it is also something that creates masterpieces and makes $$$$$$$ !<br><br>Go Barbie !!!<br><br>GO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION.",8
" I have no idea who this is made for.
","The bright colours will appeal to youngsters, and thankfully the mindless feminism will sail over their heads, the feminism sticks with young adults but the nostalgia wont appeal, and for oldies the nostalgia is fun but the poor script and acting is appalling. I think Mattel have highlighted in a 2 hour film why their toy is now completely obsolete no matter how hard they try to rebrand it. If you like comedy watch the trailer, its not just a highlights reel, it is the enitrely of anything amsuing in the whole film. The cast made the best of a bad script, but the writers have missed an opportunity to make a classic comedy for the ages.",4
" Even non-Barbie fans can enjoy this!
","I am not a huge Barbie fan. I want to say that right out of the gate. My mom, however, has a massive collection. She was at just the right age when the dolls came out that Barbie was a huge part of her life. Knowing that, I took her to see Barbie yesterday morning.<br><br>Parents of young children, there's nothing majorly inappropriate going on but you may want to wait on this one. While it's visually stunning, I wouldn't call it a kids movie. There are lots of complex themes woven into it that younger kids may not understand.<br><br>Production design is stellar! In scenes where some of the infamous Barbie dream house is involved, the props behave just like Barbie toys do. It's a subtle reminder that the team understood the assignment &amp; did not disappoint.<br><br>The costume design is also amazing. There are joking references to costumes that were discontinued that fans of the toy line will enjoy. The end credits also do a great job of referencing deep cuts in the Barbie lineup.<br><br>Diversity is on full display here &amp; it works to the film's advantage. Girls &amp; women watching this film will find a Barbie that looks like them. And gents, they didn't forget you either. There are also diverse Kens in Barbieland. In fact, I'm going to have trouble watching Kingsley Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as Gravik, because he makes a great Ken. The whole point is representation. Barbie can be anything. The movie does a great job of driving that home.<br><br>The marketing mentioned if you loved Barbie or hated Barbie, this is the movie for you. It doesn't shy away from Barbie's detractors. Gloria's daughter delivers a scathing referendum on Barbie's impact on society. But later on Gloria delivers a monologue that had my whole theater cheering when she finished. As a middle aged woman, I related to everything she said. I didn't find it preachy as some have said. It felt heartfelt &amp; reflective of what most women deal with every single day.<br><br>It's fun. At times, it's plain old goofy. The dance numbers are on point. I don't know what I was expecting but I walked out of the theater still chuckling.<br><br>It's okay to revel in the fun of it. It's okay to dive into the deeper themes. There were tons of ""Barbies"" &amp; ""Kens"" in my theater, wearing their favorite shade of pink, be it subtle or neon. The fans are all in &amp; even a reluctant movie goer like me can get on board. Lots of laughs with enough real world to make it relatable. One of the better movies I've seen in a very long time.<br><br>No post credits sequences.",9
" Was way more than I expected
","Went to the Wednesday Barbie Blow Out showing - I went into it thinking it was going to be a cute charming movie. It wasn't anything I expected, I've never seen a movie like this before, on all levels from writing, the sets. Every actor has such amazing range. The way each scene transformed your mind set, having you want more. This movie was so good It was written with current, real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with Easter eggs, while giving ode to the past and so self aware. The writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles, heartache, dissonance into everyday life, while making you cry of both laughter and sadness.",9
" Don't over analyse and it's great
","So many people have watched this movie and have absolutely dissected it to be something it isn't. Just sit back, relax, don't overthink it and it's so enjoyable. A good laugh and light hearted film. Would definitely recommend. It's funny, crazy and random but it's written so well. The little comments and mentions of certain things by certain characters make you chuckle. The story is good because it isn't just a movie of barbie. It covers what barbie was and who barbie was and where barbie went and also Ken and Allan. They cover all areas and manage to keep it light on the story and feelgood at the end.",10
" Not what I was expecting...
","I adored Ryan Gosling as Ken, and Margot Robbie was perfect as Barbie. (Parents, this is not a movie for little kids.) The beginning was hopeful and I loved the cast and the amazing set of Barbie Land. Barbie's playhouse was amazing! But as it went on, it became way too political and preachy and went downhill. If I did this movie, I would have made it a love story between Ken and Barbie and had them get married, making use of all the cool Barbie toys and her friends. But of course that would have been strangely politically incorrect, even though that's what most people still do these days. So it was a way cool set, amazing cast, but way too political for my taste.",5
" Women are incredible
","As someone who has been a fan of Barbie since I was a little girl, this movie was an incredible journey. The set was beautiful, the cast was great, and the soundtrack amazing. My favourite part though was its commentary on feminism and how the patriarchy effects both women and men negatively. It was achieved in a light hearted and caring way. The original hopes and dreams of Barbie's existence are brought to life, as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish. In a world which does not always cater to women's needs, this film does a great job of holding us all accountable. We now live in a post-Barbie movie era, and I'm so excited to see what the future holds.",10
" So much potential
","I wanted to see this movie since the set pictures got leaked. Once they released the trailer and the clips, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me.<br><br>It started off great. It was hilarious. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were amazing. Then the actual comedy stopped. Jokes fell flat. The ""Barbie world"" they set up then just ignored the toy universe they spent 20 minutes setting up to put forth terrible gags and a preachy message that made no sense. For instance, Barbie could only bend certain ways in the beginning, then she can bend her body like a normal human, then she can't again for one joke, then she can again. It was awful.<br><br>Normally, Will Ferrell is at least a little bit humorous. Even he was dry. The best part was a fake commercial halfway through it. I've wanted to get up and walk out so bad. I felt like it was also geared towards everyone in the beginning, and then adults in the last 75 minutes. It became too dramatic and preachy.<br><br>The Lego movie managed to be geared toward the family and still gave a good message in the last few minutes. That should have been the route this took.",5
" Best movie ever
","This movie is the definition of camp and fun cinema that also makes you think. I don't think I've ever laughed as much and for so long as I did when I was in the theater watching this movie. This movie is one of them where before you've even finished watching it the first time around you know you are gonna be coming back to watch it again and again. I remember watching all of the trailers and teasers and being so excited for this movie but also scared, because this could have either be the greatest movie ever or the worst movie ever. And of course it was the greatest movie ever. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to just have fun and laugh for the 2-hour run time (that flew by super quick).",10
" The Ideal Never Really Existed
","The opening scene parodying 21st Century a space oddacy was hilarious! I like it, clever. It's an idea dropped into the world which changed the society fundamentally. Babies be gone, professional dolls here we come!<br><br>I suppose it's then interesting when Barbie does encounter the real world and finds it not to have changed. It does not represent the ideals they hold in the Barbie world which they thought had spread through the world creating a new reality. No, Barbie in the real world is just one idea in a sea of ideas.<br><br>It's then fascinating to see Ken enter the real world. He finds out that Barbie is not the only idea that exists. There are others. However, instead of using this new information to find and build his own identity, he quickly discoveres the patriarchy.<br><br>Using the pariachy as a tool to surpress and subordinate women in the world which women had built for themselves. His whole life he has believed that all that matters is Barbie and Barbie's world. He therefore returns to Barbieworld to use his new found power to dominate as a form of revenge. His obsession with Barbie has not dissappeard it has manifest in a new way. He is now taking revenge on himself in a way, as he acts out behaviours which serve him superficially, but don't actually nourish his soul, his true person. He's mimicking the Behavior or Barbie, trying to make her feel the way he felt. Toxic masculinity, and domination, it's an identity born out of pain and obsession.<br><br>His story ach is the most simple to understand, he learns from Barbie that he can love himself. He can form his own identity which doesn't revolve around someone else. His identity can be one which is very personal to him and not one that exists to serve the needs of others or to impress others. He ends his obsession and idolization of Barbie and looks to love his friends, his Kens.<br><br>Barbie existing in Barbieworld finds herself to be always happy, fully in love with herself and powerful in that love for herself she creates an entire world which functions beautifully, or so she believes.<br><br>It's almost like Barbieworld is the internal personal world of an imagined player of the Barbie game. It's ordered and structured to produce good outputs. Mental stability. This sense of perfect is safe and change is not welcome. Why would Barbie ever want to change when Barbie is perfect.<br><br>However, the real world, as Barbie later finds out, is messy and complex. We watch as the feelings, insecurities, and anziety of the Mother, Gloria, are spilled onto the page and into the world of Barbie.<br><br>Barbie goes to ""weird Barbie"" who, she's is told, can cure her.<br><br>Weird Barbie is the way that she is because some child decided they didn't want to be any of the Barbies that we're in offer and so created her own character in a rather chaotic manner. Weird Barbie is created out of emotional expression and therfore has the ability to feel her negative emotions.<br><br>She offers Barbie the choice to go back to how things were before or to go on a mission to find the source of the problem. Barbie instantly chooses to revert back and not to address the problem. Barbie embodies a toxic positivity and fear of change which prevents her from accepting or noticing the problems within her reality and within the real world. Fear of change, fear of negative emotions.<br><br>In later entering the human world she encounters lots of negativity which she doesn't know how to address, it's not in her programming it's not ""what I am made for"". Eventually, we see her sit looking out to the sea and look internally. In doing this she is able to access and feel her emotions. The fear, the insecurity, the anziety. She cries, turning to the old lady on the bench next to her she tells her she is beautiful. She has learned to see her fears, feel her feelings and feel awe at the beauty of an imperfect world.<br><br>She's once again crushed by the daughter who tells her succinctly what she feels about Barbie as a tool of the patriarchy and capitalism.<br><br>Barbie feels her feelings.<br><br>Barbie had gone into the conversation with the goal of ""fixing"" the girl who'd gone rouge.<br><br>She learns here that she can't fix the problems presented by the child because she can't even begin to understand them.<br><br>Retreating back into uncertainty she willingly goes back to a figure of authority, Mattel, who say they can help get her back, home safe.<br><br>In Mattel HQ she finds out that these men have no idea what they're doing. They want to put her back in the box, as if the world has not changed and she with it. She sees at the last moment that she can't go back, there was something rotten from the beginning and she can't go back in the box, she needs to figure out how to change it.<br><br>She needs to figure out what she was made for.<br><br>This new version of her. With the new feelings. She need to find her creator.<br><br>Fortunately enough, she encounters her instantly.<br><br>Her creator is the one who, when arriving back in Barbieworld, now Kenland, can effectively fight the idea of patriarchy that has infected the minds of the women.<br><br>It's almost like Mettel are telling us that they are listening to the voices of those fighting the patriarchy and are making a commitment to change and be different in the making of this film.<br><br>Barbie gets her story ach ending when she comes to peace with her fear of death. She accepts mortality. It's again as if Mattel are telling us, the idea of Barbie is not immortal and will die. And it may have died with this generation but we're adapting and ready to change.<br><br>Barbie, the idea, the perfect Barbie. The perfect Margot Robbie ideal Barbie. The Ideal is not real. ""I was an Ideal, look so alive, turns out it's not real, what was I made for?""<br><br>The ideal must die.<br><br>It would be beautiful if they discontinued the ""original"" Barbie doll after this film.<br><br>The ideal never really exited.<br><br>It's a slightly dissatisfying ending in a way because all of the power imbalances and structural patriarchal or matriarchal in the Barbie world ideas still persist.<br><br>The fascist idiology as the daughter put it.<br><br>The world of women in power is confined to an imaginary world and men remain dominant in Mattel and in the real world.<br><br>We don't see a story arch for the society, as it never really changes. We're told in a way to accept that only incremental, tiny changes are allowed and large structural reform is pushed aside as unrealistic.",8
" What a surprise!
","Go and see it with neutrality. It is not a movie exclusively for the female audience. I have fully appreciated the way in which certain topics are addressed, such as Capitalism and Patriarchy, the stereotypes of being an attractive Woman and the problem about the toxic masculinity. At the moment it is the film that most surprised me, positively, of 2023. There's a special chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie, since, when they appear together in the first scene till the last one, and when you note this detail you cannot think : ""Damn, they're so gorgeous!"".<br><br>Would recommend it!!!!!!",8
" At least Ryan Gosling was there to save it
","Right of the bat I should say that I only got interested in this movie because it featured Ryan Gosling - and honestly, if it wasn't for him, the movie wouldn't even get one star from me.<br><br>The movie theater was filled with little girls, while I think this isn't really something a kid should be watching.<br><br>It wasn't inspiring at all for me, nor did it make me emotional. The point wasn't really well made, in fact it mostly ended up being corny and worn-out. I really found it hard to sit through the whole movie, especially the ending scenes, I just wanted it to finally be over. Wasn't really worth all the hype and the money spent.",2
" LIFE CHANGING MOVIE
","I think everybody should watch this movie. This movie will change someones perspective of the world. If someone hates on this movie is because they did not understand the message and meaning behind it. Margot Robbie did an excellent job portraying Barbie. Would totally rewatch this movie. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me think about my childhood. Its such a beautiful movie. Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors of this generation. Truly the best movie released this year. She even broke box office record for female directors. LOVE BARBIE AND EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10
" Not a fan of this movie. Too cringe to me
","Now I know a lot of people especially women like Barbie a lot, but this movie was just too cringe to me. The story was weird, the acting was a bit off, not very many characters were likable and it was also very weird seeing Ryan Gosling sing a song in this movie and he's not even that very good of a singer. I don't think this movie should even be nominated for an Oscar for best picture. It's probably likely that it will be nominated for a Razzie for most cringe movie ever. The ending wasn't that great either. Sure we got to meet Barbies creator, but it still wasn't very good. 3 out of 10 for this.",3
" Hi, Barbie!
",""" Barbie "", fulfilling the expectations of our childhood dreams.<br><br>This is the first live-action Barbie movie adaptation based on Mattel's Barbie fashion doll. Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis.<br><br>Shimmery pink in the dream world while Barbie and her friends placed lovingly. Barbie Land features detailed replicas at a specific scale to look like life-size toy dolls. The clothes, furnitures, dream house, and background of the movie set are all designed to look like the original toy. Barbie Land's construction almost entirely uses an enchanting pink colour.<br><br>Greta Gerwig as a director neatly wraps up the complex issues faced by women in society in a fun and easily accessible way.<br><br>Barbie itself is a representation of all women's hopes and desires to be anything they want, including the right to live free from violence and discrimination, to be educated, to own property, and to vote. In Barbie Land, women rule the worlds.<br><br>Barbie's casting choices have a specific quality. Barbie's Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling obviously looks perfect. Margot Robbie is a living doll, her face and posture are perfect to play the role of Barbie. Although, Ryan Gosling steals the whole show. Ken looks fun to hang out with.<br><br>The entire soundtrack of the Barbie movie is very meaningful and upbeat.",8
" Give it a chance - Surprisingly clever for a colourful and fun movie
","First of all, please can we all hail Ryan Gosling for the stellar performance of Beach Ken. I had reservations as he is older than I would have picked for that role but hot damn does he give it his all and it pays off. Genuinely Oscar worthy stuff. Also can we also all appreciate how good the song ""I'm Just Ken"" is!<br><br>The first half of the film is absolute Barbie magic in all of its glory. Second half wasn't quit as strong but as a 20's female that has struggled a little with deciding who/what I want to be, this hit a surprising emotional spot for me. I think behind all the glitter and silly fun, it has quite a good message. I must admit that it was cleverly done.<br><br>My only real criticism is the film appears mostly targeted at a young audience when anyone under 10 probably wouldn't grasp the plot and messaging of the movie.<br><br>For anyone not really vibing with the marketing for this movie, definitely give it a chance! It's better than expected.",8
" I laughed, I felt understood, I felt touched
","I laughed, I felt understood, I felt touched. It's so relatable as a woman and as person trying to navigate this world. It made me remind me as child and me now, as a 24 year old woman. I liked it more than I was anticipating. Great movie. The ""ask him about the Godfather"" was sending me. And the whole monologue about the contradictory expectations of womanhood, it was too relatable. Everything America Ferrera's character said, everything. The movie also touches on what it means to be a person, and the ending when Barbie decides she wants to experience what it's like to be human, it was also very touching. Also when Ken realises his idendity shouldn't revolve around Barbie. I don't give it a 10 cause I don't consider it perfect, but it's very close to it.",9
" Out of control
","I thought the plot was very out of control and did not have a way to end itself. Most scenes last 1-2 minutes too long and the ending is terrible. No resolve was ever made to the story which leaves. We have this whole movie about how both matriarchy and patriarchy are not perfect or good, but instead of leaning into that the movie ends with everything going back to how they were before. Politics aside, this movie had no clear goal in mind for the plot and it showed in a very convoluted mess. One positive is the set design and costumes were amazing. The actors were okay in this movies and flashes of comedy was shown, but most jokes are over used or just fall flat.",2
" A Hoot!
","This Barbie script, IMHO, is packed on so many levels of thought - on were we are today and how we got there. To those who trash it, I say, ""Lighten up Francis.""<br><br>Everyone plays their part uniquely and with verve. And the set alone should be considered for an Oscar. We needed this movie for the sake of sanity... too much politicking has clouded the atmosphere.<br><br>To all those who grew up with Barbie, Ken, and G. I. Joe, I hope you remember that it was a time for childlike innocence to play and have fun.<br><br>There is truth in comedy... just ask Aristophanes.<br><br>Reflect on it.<br><br>Note: The reference to Kubrick's 2001 (1968) is absolutely hysterical.",8
" not what i expected after all that hype
","First of all , the marketing of this movie was truly another level of promoting movies, while getting banned in some countries , mine decided to put it under age restriction.<br><br>So i went with the hype arround it, all pinky and sparkling to dive in barbie world as an old player i was expecting that the movie will touch a place in my but sadly it was flat and boring , not only that i still can't see a picture to be told behind it.<br><br>The actress felt flat too even the outfits they used to promote the movie were way better then the ones they used in the movie .4
but i enjoyed ryan gossling acting and at some point he was funny.",4
" What a delightful surprise!
","I was hesitant when I put it on but WOW! I never imagined it'd be as good as it is! The acting was on point, beautiful sets, and an amazing storyline &amp; plot! 👏 when I first attempted to watch it, I thought it wouldn't be worth much so I was doing other things, caught myself several times stopping to watch until I finally paused it, finished what I was doing and sat down to watch it from the beginning and I'm so glad I did. I've already recommended it to my friends. Glad I was able to take advantage of Amazon having it to purchase as I hate movie theaters. So it worked out well being as I can now watch it whenever I like. Which I'm sure will be often.",10
" Far deeper than just a a movie about a doll
","The Barbie movie was a fun movie that lacked a little bit in plot, but was overall a hilarious movie to watch. While many people out there seem to hate this movie for empowering women and taking down men, they are looking at it the wrong way, they movie gave an in depth tour into all the common stereotypes set on women and men and intensified them to show their true meanings and how people can become affected by them, all while keeping the Barbie theme at the heart of the plot. It addressed and took down many of the common stereotypes and truly exposed the reality of society for what it really is, a patriarchy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing however the movie is sure to make clear that women should and can have a more equal presence in ""powerful"" positions in society.",9
" Unique and everything you want it to be.
","The movie is amazing, Margot Robbie gives an amazing performance and the ending is unique and has somewhat of a Truman show vibe for me , Ryan Gosling is amazing as Ken and overall the cast is phenomenal in their roles. However, I feel like the plot is at some places a little bit weak and it feels as though this film sets out on a crusade to educate you on the injustices in the real world and does mainly focus on feminism and issues surrounding that topic but it does also cover topics that aren't specific to feminism. Overall, I do not mind the role of feminism in this story and the mother daughter relationship as well as the whole female focused parts of this movie because it is simply amazing and at the end of the day we have to consider this is a movie about Barbie so all those topics are perfectly acceptable in this movie. For example, if this was a movie about some traditionally boyhood toy you would expect it to embrace that in its narrative. In conclusion, I feel as though this deserves a much higher rating then 7.8 for me personally at least a 8.5 or higher therefore I have decided to put 10/10 so the average is higher and the movie is rated properly.",10
" Lots of marketing and little content
","Anyone who says the movie is good is undoubtedly a Barbie fan; It is a film with a poor script, filled with a lot of padding, sometimes somewhat absurd, but which is necessary to be able to meet the duration of the film and nothing more. The social representation of the main characters is disappointing, belittling both the female and male gender on many occasions and with a slightly distorted conceptualization of common thinking. In relation to the characters, one or the other rescues the development of the film due to its trajectory on the big screen, but nothing exceptional. This is without a doubt a film that I would not see again on any given Sunday while I rest; Even if I'm being honest, it's on my list of the worst movies I've seen in my last 15 years, but be the witness yourself. In short, I can say that it is a film with great marketing management, whose work team deserves a big applause.",2
" Good way of rewriting and reimagining iconic characters
","The movie is entertaining, funny and it does touches on more serious topics, there is times that it feels that those topics are too on the face and can ruin the passing but is rarely noticeable.<br><br>The way that the characters evolution is natural and interesting and I can sympathise with a lot of the characters.<br><br>Is a fun movie and making a Barbie movie a pg13 is a really risky but innovative way of representing this iconic character
Is also really important to notice that the movie because of its nature is going to cause a lot of polarisation and hate, I think that the movie could have been more subtle on delivering the ideology but I understand why they didn't do it.",8
" Not great world building, therefore confusing message
","The movie did some real weird worldbuilding where none of the rules were consistent. I had to keep reminding myself that barbieland was made by men, therefore barbieland is not an exact opposite of the real world - it's a rendering of what ""men"" think female utopia is. But it wasn't a direct opposite of real world either. I doubt many viewers will actually be able to internalize that as part of the lore.<br><br>The parallel between realworld and barbieland just didn't make sense therefore it felt like a plot fail. If barbies are all important unlike women in the real world, where does Ken swooning over Barbie land on on that real world spectrum?<br><br>Im just going to say, the fact that Barbie has 0 complex feelings until the lady from the real world played with her, but Ken was aware of being unhappy WHILE being not a person but an accessory to Barbie is the kind of double crossing i didn't expect. I was confused about which point it tried proving.<br><br>Ryan Gosling has a real chance to become an icon for incels after this performance. He gets rejected, creates an ultramasculine society, and at the end Barbie apologises to him and he rebrands? He was a villain and did not get a redemption arc. He shouldn't even be sentient in this universe as much as he is. I expected Barbie to be honest with him and say she just doesn't love him, or that she wasn't made to have those feelings to him because Matell did not give her those feelings. Instead she apologises for not giving him more attention?<br><br>Anyways, it wasn't feminist enough for me. It felt like it avoided some major issues of real life (like the phrase ""we just learned how to hide it better"" that did not get addressed whatsoever). Like, the Barbies now know that women don't have it as great as them in the real world? How does that solve anything?<br><br>Maybe i am just reading too deep into a movie with flawed worldbuilding, made for people who don't generally see the gender bias around them?<br><br>4 for some funny jokes, but it could be funnier.",4
" So much fun!!
","This is such a unique film! It was so much fun, and had its sweet moments as well! All the choreography was excellently done. The costumes were amazing! I also loved the take Greta had on barbie, and some real problems women and men face. I truly feel like this was such a special movie- and it does not feel like anything I have ever seen before. It was also very funny! (And that's coming from someone who does not like comedy's) I was giggling all the way through the movie. So sad that this gets so much hate, I just feel like it's such a fun movie that everyone should see. So much fun!! Greta Gerwig has done it again!",10
" Fun filled and pink!
","A pink lovers dream really,<br><br>I sat down at this film with nothing but open mindedness and a slight sense of uncomfortableness as being one of the few men in seated at the showing.<br><br>However leaving this film I was filled with a great sense of joy, a near two hour course of fun, laughter and adult themes to make this a great film. Could a child watch this for the sake of it purely being Barbie? Yes. Could an adult enjoy this and understand the true meanings of the film? Yes!<br><br>Without giving any spoilers away Greta Gerwig delivers a fun filled adventure with mature enough themes to open the eyes of many film goers to see what is really out there happening in todays world and this a pure reflection of that formatted in a way that all can enjoy.<br><br>A seemingly fully invested enable cast bring the life and soul to this film, Gosling seemingly carrying this film on his back and Margot's performance was also good enough.<br><br>The cinematography and stage design for this was exactly how you would imagine and provide a great backdrop to this film, The musical numbers and art style were in complete sync boosting the film to wild heights.<br><br>Some tough, touching and some frankly weird scenes (The very end) left me feeling great overall and its certainly a film I would see again and one I would recommend.",8
" Barbie has no ending
","The whole movie is a gentle punch of love covered in perfect pink. You don't have to be perfect, you are who you are, and your existence itself shall be of intrinsic value.<br><br>Barbie was created to be a playmate for girls, inspiring them to grow and become outstanding and successful women in all walks of life.<br><br>But in the real world, Barbie found that she had not fulfilled her mission at all. Her perfect body and appearance caused women body anxiety and appearance anxiety. Served as an accomplice to the objectification of women, she has been sugar-coated by capitalism to be propaganda for consumerism and unrealistic physical ideas, destroyed growth of innate sense of worth and has set the equal rights movement back 50 years.<br><br>Barbie fell into a deep existential crisis, ""If I can't fulfill my mission, what is the meaning of my existence?""
The answer given by the director comes from a place of love: ""Your existence itself has intrinsic value, you don't have to earn it, and you have every right to define the meaning of your existence.""<br><br>When I looked at the QQ Music Original Soundtrack comment section, I realized that many audience have been moved to tears, so was I especially during below parts:<br><br>1. A conversation between Barbie and an old woman on a bench at a bus stop.<br><br>In the world where Barbie lives, there is no aging or death, and everyone is always young and exquisite. When she came to the real world, she met an old lady, and for the first time she looked at this face full of wrinkles, and said sincerely, "" You are beautiful"", which represents her acceptance of aging and the imperfect being of the world, and also represents she has been able to make her own definition of beauty for the very first time ever, and this is the first step for her innate sense of self to emerge.<br><br>For a long time, in the perfect Barbieland/narratives of consumerism, only perfect and exquisite high heels and clothes, slim and graceful figure and face, decent residence and cars and luxurious parties are beauty. But this time, Barbie defines beauty in a different way by herself.<br><br>Only when she truly accepts herself, the self who doesn't like high heels, has cellulite on her legs, will age and die, will be confused and sad, can she truly accept the outside world and other people without criticism. And only by true acceptance of the world, other people and herself, one can generate genuine respect. Only then can she look at the old grand lady's hunched back and wrinkled face, and still think it is beautiful.<br><br>In my opinion, apart from aging, sickness and death, all other worries in life are merely a matter of values, but aging, sickness and death have no solution. Being able to reconcile with aging is not only the calmness of watching one's vitality disappear little by little, but also the courage to face the countdown to death, and the courage to accept this helplessness and cherish every minute of life even more.<br><br>This reminds me of a related story. Long, long ago, in a faraway land, a king received a prophecy that his son would either become the greatest king ever lived in history or become an unprecedented spiritual leader. The king thought of the thin, poor and sloppy practitioners wandering around he has seen in the past, and was very afraid that his son would abandon the road of ruling and become such, so he built an exquisite, luxurious and enclosed pavilion for him, a walled garden of earthly delights and endless enjoyment. Only the healthy, the young and the happy were allowed inside. Immersed in the pleasures of senses, the prince came of age, protected from the limitations of mortal being and signs of decay and aging. But one day the prince grew curious of outside and wanted to travel outside. So the king ordered all the elderly, sick or dying people to hide at home during the prince's visit. But during his visit outside, God deliberately sent an old man to hobble alongside the road and appeared in the prince's sight. The prince saw an old man for the first time, realized the existence of aging for the first time, and the world and the paradise he once knew collapsed upon him. Then he ran back to his palace with shock and despair. Just like children, when they encountered troubles outside, were bullied, they'd run home to let their parents solve the problem, but this time, no one's parents couldn't solve this trouble, not even if his father was the king of the whole universe, he still could not protect his son from the knowledge of mortality. Later, in order to free the world from the suffering of life, aging, sickness and death, the prince resolutely abandoned everything and embarked on the road of no return. After going through all kinds of hardships and dangers, he finally nirvana and became an unprecedented spiritual leader.<br><br>2. Barbie observed the environment in the park on the bench alone and felt the strong and various emotions of human beings for the first time. The warmth of sunlight, the mottled tree shadows, and the gentle breeze of wind. Barbie shed a tear. Cause before this, she had never felt these emotions, now she has felt what it was like to be alive for the very first time.<br><br>The human world is not only filles with happiness, but also anxiety, sadness, and helplessness. But it's all those lows that make those happy moments all the more precious.<br><br>3. Warmth of your gaze:<br><br>Ken was created as an accessory to Barbie, who would always stand on the beach waiting for Barbie to say hello to him. He has no home, no friends, no job, no ideals, no ego. Ken symbolizes lovestruck girls who lost their sense of self. He projects the ideals and the fantasies of the best qualities a person can have onto a specific person who he does not know yet, making this person an ever-judging God. For him, only when Barbie's eyes are on him, is he happy. Barbie's rejection has validated his miserable existence. But this is not true love. This is why when Barbie said to Ken, ""you must discover who you are without me"", this feels so warm, it's the movie's gentle message to all girls who are deeply troubled by love to find their self again.<br><br>It's not Barbie and Ken
It's not Ken and Barbie
It's Barbie and it's Ken<br><br>4. At the end, the conversation between Barbie and the founder Ruth is like a kid and a benevolent old mother. The background music of ""What was I made for"" only made it harder to hold my tears. For those who have been or are looking for the meaning of life, this scene would strike you. ""You created me, don't you control me? Don't I need your permission to be a human?"" If there's higher existence who created us, does he hope to give us complete freedom to choose our beliefs, our values, our actions? And by freedom, I mean, he does not rely on miracles, or bread, or promises of heaven to lure us, to guide us, but to allow us to choose completely freely. And can we afford the heavy burdens of this freedom? So many people couldn't bear it and choose various biased ideologies to get rid of the pain of independent thinking, to get rid of the loneliness of finding meaning in the context of nihilism.<br><br>In the end, Barbie's ending is also the most inspiring story ending ever, because she didn't choose to stay in Eden-like Barbieland, but chose to become a real human. Seeing that the human world is imperfect, is filled with anxiety and sadness, aging and death, she still chooses this path. Because what she wants is an adventure, so compelling that the pain and suffering of life, as well as the aging and death, would all become worthwhile. Only in this way can she feel her own existence-no longer a manufactured thing, but the creator of her own destiny, the definer of her own meaning.<br><br>Humans only have one ending, but ideas flew forever.<br><br>And Barbie has no ending.",10
" Barbie&Ken
","The marketing for this movie was seriously unlike anything else Billie Eillish, Xbox, Aldo, Burger King? Nyx, Forever 21, google etc.<br><br>It had a LOT of adult concepts and words that would go right over the kiddos heads (gynecologist, patriarchy, genitals, ""beaching each other off"") honestly i don't think small children would enjoy it much. It was definitely more for teens and adults (PG13) it had a lot of great comedy. I liked seeing Barbieland ran by women in strong leadership positions and think the ken dolls were fun depicted as accessories/ kinda lost without Barbie. It was cool to have a deep realistic spin on it but it's just not a feel good movie like I had hoped since they had Ken be so angry the whole movie, all the creepy men and the constant crying and anxiety from Barbie . We were in the existential anxiety part for most of the movie which made the happy ending feel super rushed.<br><br>I think my low review has to do with the fact that we live through all the body image issues and sexism gender role stuff it's nice to take a break and watch a light hearted movie every once in a while.",3
" It's Barbie and KEN
","The movie was unexpectedly fun starting from all the references related to the actual Barbie doll to the costumes and till even the Barbie world itself. Overall I think there is a good balance between satire and sincerity, crammed with impeccable attention to details. Even tough as a watcher I expected Barbie to be the star of the show, in many moments Ken was actually such a fun scene-stealer that at one point I felt the movie should truly be Barbie and Ken.<br><br>I could totally agree to the fact that the movie is a riotous, candy colored feminist fable and it's true that Barbie does many of the things we've been promised: there is much mocking and loving of Barbie, and plenty of costumes but none of those things make it subversive. From my point of view it's a movie that enormously pleased with itself but even tough it's very pretty it's not that very deep.",8
" Super Cringe, Poor script
","Barbie: A Rollercoaster of Emotions<br><br>In the vast cinematic universe, every now and then we stumble upon movies that leave us perplexed. The recent entrant to this league is the film ""Barbie."" Now, while one might naturally expect whimsical magic, tales of transformation, or inspirational stories from a Barbie-themed narrative, this movie takes an entirely different turn.<br><br>The film starts with a ""wow"" moment, and by that, I mean it does capture attention. Vibrant colors, meticulous animation, and that pristine, Barbie-esque world build an immediate intrigue. It's almost as if you're handed a glossy magazine and can't wait to flip through the pages.<br><br>Soon enough, laughter echoes, thanks to a series of light-hearted and sometimes slapstick comedic scenes. ""Hahahaha,"" goes the audience, and you find yourself laughing along. The humor is akin to what you'd find in classic cartoons where situations spiral out of control in the most unpredictable manner. But then, unpredictability isn't a constant in this movie, as we soon discover.<br><br>As the plot progresses, the jokes transition from being genuinely funny to being cringe-worthy. One cannot help but feel that the writers might have been trying a tad bit too hard to maintain the film's comedic momentum. The dialogue, the character interactions, the situations - everything starts to reek of cliches that most of us have outgrown. It's akin to that feeling when someone stretches a joke far beyond its elastic limit - it snaps.<br><br>""Super cringe"" is an apt descriptor for the midpoint of the movie. It's as though the film decided to try on every trope in the book. At this juncture, I found myself torn between wanting to continue watching out of sheer curiosity or to flee and save myself further second-hand embarrassment. It's the cinematic equivalent of a car crash - you can't help but watch, even if through the gaps in your fingers.<br><br>The descent into ""ewww"" territory is swift. The choices made by characters, the overdone scenes, and some seemingly unnecessary dramatic moments make one question the very essence of the storyline. Is this still a Barbie movie or a parody of itself?<br><br>Just when you're on the brink of giving up, the movie surprises with a ""serious speech."" This soliloquy feels out of place, like an oasis in a desert. The emotional weight behind the words and the depth it brings is commendable. It's as if the movie momentarily redeems itself, reminding us of the values and the principles that Barbie, as a brand, has stood for over the years.<br><br>But before one can dwell on this profound moment, the movie hurries towards ""the end."" The conclusion, or lack thereof, is a testament to the film's erratic narrative journey. It's disjointed, abrupt, and leaves more questions than answers.<br><br>In summation, ""Barbie"" is predictably unpredictable. From the promising start to the descent into a muddled mess, the movie is an enigma. The storyline's trajectory is confusing, and it's evident that there was a lack of clear direction in what the writer was trying to convey. The film lacks a proper ending and leaves viewers in a lurch, desperately trying to piece together the filmmaker's intent.<br><br>For ardent Barbie fans, this might be a disappointment. For those looking for something unconventional (albeit chaotically so), it might be worth a watch. One thing is certain, though: this film is bound to spark conversations, be it about its brilliance or its sheer audacity. But as the age-old adage goes - any publicity is good publicity. And ""Barbie"" sure has got everyone talking.",1
" A FESTIVE, LIGHT-HEARTED COMEDY THAT SENDS MEANINGFUL MESSAGES ABOUT WOMANHOOD & SELF-LOVE.
","This is the kind of movie I want my teenage daughter to grow up watching. To get to know and appreciate the flaws, strengths, and weaknesses that come with being a woman, whatever it is, 'Because Barbie can be anything, WE can be anything'.<br><br>I expected the movie Barbie to be about the origin of Barbie or about Barbie's adventures like most other Barbie animated movies, but it turned out to be much more than that. It really explores the value of empowering women, which is typical of Greta Gerwig.<br><br>I really enjoyed the first half of the film, mainly because of the beautiful scenery, colorful colors, and Barbieland. I was also surprised by how gorgeous Margot Robbie looks as Barbie, and the costumes and set designs are so beautiful. As the movie progresses, I realized that this movie will become more profound and emotional, and Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken, handsome, funny, and energetic. Even though Ken is ""Kenough,"" the film does not ignore the role of men, and we love Allan. The movie is a bit dull at times, and some of the jokes are cringey, but it's still enjoyable to watch to the end.<br><br>I think the best part of the movie is the ending, when Barbie talks to Ruth in a really meaningful way. It's really touching and uplifting, with a really thoughtful message about womanhood and self-love.<br><br>Barbie (2023) might not be perfect and it might not be everyone's favorite, but hey, nothing's perfect, right?<br><br>-@fineapplespov.",8
" It could not have been more perfect.
","This movie is absolutely genius. There are so many reasons why our society needed this movie and all
of it's real life messages. The emotion. The monologues. The acting. The music. Everything was perfect!<br><br>Barbie addresses the real world in hopes of finding the girl who played with her but ends up embarking on more of a self discovery journey. The real world isn't what she thought it would be, and Barbie world has been taken over by the Kens. With teamwork and unlikely friendship, the Barbies are able to take back Barbieland. The feminism throughout this movie ROCKED. I loved how it didn't necessarily bash men, but it did shine a light on the the massive egotism that tends to overcome men and their logic. As well as their belief to be superior to women. The was the best movie of the entire year. And one do the best movies of the entire decade so far.<br><br>On behalf all women everywhere, we thank you!!",10
" Surprised but not disappointed
","I went into this movie thinking it would be a mature twist on the classical Barbie figure and the 'ideal' life of Barbie &amp; Ken, as Barbie related content is usually known for.<br><br>I was however quite surprised with the depth of the themes in this movie. The themes of gender equality and femininity were touched on in a very observant and interesting fashion, not necessarily pushing any agenda but instead giving the viewer their own opportunity to make their mind up and think a bit. Despite the serieus themes, the movie is very funny and gives a lot of big and small nudges to the Barbie franchise and history. It's remarkably weird at times, but in a good way.<br><br>The acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is great, as well as by a lot of the side characters. The set designs are also amazingly done and give the movie a nice feel. The audience was very hyped up and clapped or screamed on multiple occasions, improving the cinema experience on our visit at the opening night as well.<br><br>Would definitely recommend a cinema viewing!",8
" Shallower than you can imagine
","At first, I didn't want to go on this film. Then I was drowned to the movie theater by the advertising campaign expecting something. But nothing is actually occurred.<br><br>I mean really it was as simple as it gets entertainment, not even interesting, sometimes worst to say boring.<br><br>Thus, I honestly don't understand the universal admiration for this movie. It literally has nothing to offer.<br><br>I went to the bathroom and I didn't feel like I was losing anything because I had a deep inner feeling that I really had nothing to lose in this film. Furthermore, I think that is the best categorization for this movie.<br><br>You have nothing to lose if you don't see it.",5
" Wow! So Good and Right On Time!
","I went into Barbie with no expectations, only hopes that it would be entertaining, even if the intended audience is pretty young. Well, I was wrong about the age of the intended audience because obviously the intended audience is me and my fellow 80's babies/90's teens! I absolutely loved it and definitely entertained. I laughed, got teary eyed, and even cheered at times. Margot Robbie shined, Ryan Gosling gave me a new perspective on Ken, and the costumes dazzled. The themes, jokes, and one-liners were actually pretty insightful. Barbie Movie is not all pretty fluff and makeup. It's the MOMENT.",9
" Just meh.
","So, the Barbie movie was ""meh""<br><br>There's been a ton of hype about the film's political bent and honestly, yes... the patriarchal nonsense is a bit heavy handed but that's not even what made it so bad.<br><br>It was just dumb.<br><br>It was too long and nonsensical and I really don't know how to sum it up other than that.<br><br>I laughed a couple of times and one or two parts almost resonated with me, but then it just went from relatable to preachy and I just eyerolled so hard.<br><br>It was mostly just boring and dumb, and that's disappointing because it looked great, the cast was great, and it had such potential to be a great self-aware meta comedy. It just failed so hard at doing that.<br><br>My summary: Barbie gains sentience, fights the patriarchy, becomes a real girl, and goes to the gynecologist.<br><br>This movie will NOT appeal to young kids.<br><br>I can almost guarantee they'll find it boring.<br><br>It's not a typical kids movie riddled with double entendres and over-their-heads adult humor. It's just adult humor and it's not even particularly funny (just my opinion).<br><br>It absolutely looks amazing, it looks like it was made with kids in mind, it looks like a nostalgia trip for moms, and it looks like family fun.<br><br>However... with the exception of looking amazing, it accomplishes none of that. (The Mario Movie did all of those things sooo much better in my opinion. THAT movie was darn near perfect.)<br><br>If you wanna see Barbie, go for it. But if you're considering taking little kids I would not personally recommend it. 😘",2
" Great message and walk in history!
","We saw a pre-screening of the Barbie movie last night. I loved the walk down memory lane and some new facts about the history of Barbie scattered through the film. There were great messages around what feminism really is but also how when one gender holds all the power it's not a good balance. The actors were brilliant and Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken was just perfection. Margot Robbie made the perfect ""stereotypical"" Barbie but took us on an emotional ride of discovery. All in all it was an enjoyable movie with a great script. Great for Barbie fans and anyone who has a connection to Barbie from their childhoods!",9
" Fun and honest
","Although I had read varing opinions on the film, I hadn't bought into them too much as I didn't want anything to be spoiled. It isn't the standard kind of film i would watch but I found it fun, colourful and heart felt with a sad, honest but important undertone and message. I dont see how embracing Inclusivity, equality, femininity and respecting bodily and mental autonomy is a negative. I think this film will make certain people uncomfortable and easily confused as to the message it is trying to convey but I'm glad they didn't dumb it down for those particular audiences and were brave enough not to pander. My kids loved the film and it allowed for some discussion and reflection without breaking the fun vibe.",10
" I am Kenough
","Greta Gerwig should be proud of herself and so should everyone involved in the making of Barbie because it was such a great film . I watched Barbie on the first day it came out and the cinema was packed, when it got to the scene where the Mum was telling the Barbie's what it's really like to be a woman the audience were clapping because they agreed and it creates such a lovely atmosphere that I've never been in or felt at the cinema . Many people who haven't watched the movie seem to have a problem with it because they think it's just about feminism when it's now because when the Barbie's eventually got there power back they didn't create a matriarchy like the Ken's creating a patriarchy but they found a way to live as close to equally as they could. Overall, Barbie is a great film and you should watch it no matter what anybody says because you will feel changed in a sort of way that you can't put into words after seeing it.",8
" Worst movie ever
","I have to express my disappointment with this movie, as it is riddled with an overwhelming number of loopholes and plot holes that hinder the overall viewing experience. It's quite disheartening to find that there is a noticeable absence of a compelling and engaging story, leaving the audience wanting more substance and coherence.<br><br>Frankly, I cannot help but think that investing time in watching this film is not the best use of one's entertainment hours. Instead, I would suggest diverting attention to purchasing a Barbie doll, allowing for a more enjoyable and imaginative playtime experience.<br><br>In conclusion, I find it regrettable that this movie fails to live up to expectations, and I consider it to be an utter waste of valuable time and cinematic potential.",1
" One of the Best Comedies Released in the Last Few Years
","I went to see Barbie with the highest of expectations and it did not disappoint.<br><br>At times the whole movie theatre was laughing out loud. It was a beautiful experience to share. And there was even clapping at the end.<br><br>It does not matter if you are young or old, a man or a woman, this is a movie you will enjoy.<br><br>Do yourself a favor: leave your judgements aside and go watch it.<br><br>Brief disclaimer: it is Barbie. It does touch on some controversial issues; considering Barbie always has been a female stereotype. It touches on the place of the woman in the world, the patriarchy, etcetera. I was not prepared for that and I do have some strong personal opinions on the topic itself. That being said: everything was so beautifully done and told and funny I seriously cannot complain about it. I honestly really enjoyed it.",8
" The movie is about Ken not Barbie
","Yes Barbie is the title of the movie but when watching it I increasingly feel like she is only playing the supporting role to Ken in a weird way.<br><br>Ken is kinda a simp but he's also the only one that has a proper story around him, starting as a nobody, then his whole personality changed when he got his ""redpilled"" moment, got some musical songs to perform, have a comradery moment with the other Ken's before it finally went back to normal. It all made him a lot more human than Barbie ever was in the film.<br><br>The weirdest thing in this movie though, is that despite singing girl power and feminism, it doesn't have likeable female characters outside of their good looks. Most of the females in this film are bland, mean, manipulative, and somewhat narcissitic especially when the word perfect always getting brought up. They don't even put in any scenes about the hardship of women, outside of maybe the booty grabbing part which is done like a joke. I wished they would've shown more of that instead of putting that in a speech. And you get a female lead that doesn't even want change or do anything with it unless being pushed around. There is no process around any of the achievements or struggles on the women's side, just results in a form of speeches and short scenes.",5
" Amazin
","Was absolutely amazing. Barbie came to life, it felt exactly like when I was a kid. It brings a deeper more meaningful message without being too harsh. I love how it brings the 2 worlds and perspectives together, it really got me thinking. When barbie goes to the real word, I truely felt like I could relate, as if it was speaking to me and probably most women out there. It's definitely a movie for those who love as well as hate barbie. Its a 10 out of 10 for me. Everyone must see this to gain perspective, a doll's world so completely mirroring our own. Also, the toys of this movie is amazing, a must see.",10
" A movie wich is deeper then I tought

Kind of feel sorry for him<br><br>Anyway the movie , it hits different right into my feelings. Especially the song what was I made for.<br><br>It's a fun movie with some fun musical numbers ( I am just Ken ) and its nostalgic all those different Barbies , in there Barbieland with there dreamhouses.<br><br>The costume design was great , simple but also retro like Barbies gingam dress with the 50's shape<br><br>The 80's roller skating outfits<br><br>It's all great.",9

" Reputation of Barbie destroyed.
","Why destroyed? Cause there was nothing to defend that lovely doll. If you ever watched Toy Story and if you understood what Woody felt after being discarded... It is all in the Barbie movie. Second issue is about the Creator (ghost of Ruth Handler). Barbie meets her in the kitchen I felt like she Barb is a Neo from Matrix...too many similarities. Finally the Geppetto (Ruth) will grand Barbie's wish. No and no! Barbie in the movie is a narcisst who ruled cause she was aromantic. She is like a child in an adult body. Sugar daddys are looking for that kind of persons. Matriarchy without a c..t not a hard job apparently. They show how to use men for women advantages only. Finally thx to ""Geppetto"" she the Barbie got a c..t for herself so she moved out from Barbieland. It is really all wrong. Barbie is not supposed to be Paris Hilton biography. Barbie is a doll and not deserve a movie. Barbie is a mannequin and a business. You can not make a good movie about a Barbie when you use a Pinocchio idea. Barbie aspired to be a real woman. I saw it already in Pinocchio. Except he wanted to be a real boy.",1
" A hilariously campy oasis
","I think Greta Gerwig perfectly threaded the needle between astute social commentary on Barbie, and a love letter to the doll that shaped America. It is a campy oasis in the midst of an industry that seems to increasingly worship somber realism. It has all the charm of an 80s cult classic, on a 2023 budget. Alongside hilarious writing that made my cheeks hurt by the end, is incredible set and costume design, and standout acting performances from a remarkably cohesive cast. There are also subtle details I really appreciated like Barbie's car being a 1959 corvette, the same year the doll was released. I'll knock one star off because in a few moments towards the end, the plot gets lost in itself, and it feels like they are speaking in riddles.",9
" A kids movie
","I don't understand all the hype around this movie. I found it boring, with almost no plot. It had a few fun moments, nothing too funny, I don't think I ever laughed throughout the whole movie. A great performance from Ryan Gosling indeed, although Margot Robbie was perhaps mediocre. He definitely stole the thunder. Regarding patriarchy and feminism, it merely scratched the surface of those terms. It was perhaps more of a simulation of how an elementary teacher would explain patriarchy to kids. It doesn't offer anything to adults, except for if they lived in a cave and never heard about patriarchy.",3
" New and very very touching
","I was VERY excited to see Barbie and I expected SO much. I feel like I got more of the unexpected, and less of what I expected, though I don't really know what I expected.<br><br>Songs...
I loved the mix of already existing songs and customed songs for this movie. I adored Billie Eilishs song What Was I Made For, it was so touching.<br><br>The fighting scene with all the Kens at the beach was ridiculously amazing, and Ryan Gosling has never looked better, hehe. I loved the choreography in that big space with blue and pink, Ken Can. Music was 10/10.<br><br>Emotion...
When Barbie saw what the real world was like I felt tears running down my face, I was so hurt by the truth. I mean, not even in this Barbie movie, we can forget about the unfair world for women. But without it, the movie wouldn't be as great.<br><br>A big part of the movie was emotional and I thought that was great. When they talked about death, I really felt it.<br><br>Overall, the movie was way more than I thought it would be and I definitely recommend it. The humor isn't hilarious but I chuckled when jokes were relatable.",8
" Superb movie about identity
",A beautiful light tale about the development and conditioning of identity and self esteem and how it can lead to stereotypical behavior and dependency in relationships. But also how a person can get the intuition that it feels better to make a choice for another direction in one's life. The first steps in this new direction starts with a new physical sensation in your feet and emotional associations about getting older and dying in the end. Like in 'The Little Mermaid' you have to sacrifice things that were important to you but once you stepped into this new world it feels like being born for the second time. Superb movie.,10
" I LOVE it!
","The movie did something that has never been done before. The details, the music, comedy, and my favourite.... the outifts!!! I could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a Barbie. I truly reccomend you warching this film, not only it is entertaining, but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself. The movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worse.<br><br>I have no doubt that this is the best Greta Gerwig's movie yet and I hope in the future she will spoil us with more fascinating stuff.",8
" Barbie Tries Too Hard
","Barbie struggles to both identify and captivate the audience. Who is it written for? Whist there is one laugh out loud moments; with Sugar Daddy Barbie, the movie seems too drawn out and drags at times. Despite having important themes about misogyny, you can't help feel that a bit more subtlety would have got the message across. Whilst empowering the female characters and making them well rounded, the male characters come across as macho stereotypes. I was looking forward to seeing future Doctor Who Ncuti Gatwa, but it was more of a blink and you will miss it. Rather than a message of equality, you are left feeling this has a women are superior message.<br><br>On a positive note, though, the movie is a great homage to the history of Barbie and it is very much about spotting the discontinued Barbie products. It also shows young girls that they can be ambitious and anything is possible.",5
" A funny, visual treat but . . . .
","I watched the Barbie movie last night. Overall I would say that it's a very creative dare I say, outstanding, movie. The premise is brilliant albeit kind of uncomfortable with its generalization of gender roles and what I'd like to think were hyperbolic stereotypes. But, I am a guy and I definitely have my blind spots as many know. However I do try to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. After all I do have many capable and strong women in my life that I'm concerned whether they get treated fairly.<br><br>But, despite these slightly unsettling misgivings it's a really funny movie. The mixed animation and live action is remarkable and many of the characters are really well written. That is aside from the male characters; they're all pretty much one dimensional dullards who generally can't get out of their own way. Thus it's a mix of humorous social commentary with keystone cop slapstick. But it's so visually rich it's like a cinematic ice cream sundae.<br><br>Margot Robbie was made for this role. Her performance was a combination of sweet naivete and compelling poignancy. And she looks like a Barbie. That's remarkable. Many of the other ""Barbie"" dolls were performed excellently as well. Kate McKinnon is really funny in it even though it seemed at times she was adlib/riffing a la SNL with one eye on the audience, but she's very good as the bad(?) Barbie. I was surprised and pleased to see John Cena make an appearance or two as the Neptune Ken; that was pretty funny.<br><br>Both Ryan Gosling and Simon Liu were good as Ken and . . . Well, Ken. Their characters actually had a little depth to them which allowed them to grow (a little) over the course of the story. America Ferrera is a good actor and she was solid but not compelling. For my taste her climatic speech(es) were heavy-handed but they did serve a story development purpose.<br><br>So, in short I really enjoyed the movie. It was visually compelling and much of the acting outstanding. While the story may rankle some OGs out there, for anyone who was/is married or has a daughter or a sister or a mother (I guess that's everyone) they know that women often times have suffered from gender bigotry and so being sympathetic to that I think they'll find it is a really good movie. And there's probably nothing wrong with being reminded of that struggle now and then.<br><br>Oh, and the music. It's got a great soundtrack. And the final song ""What Was I Made For?"" written by both Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell and sung by Billie stopped me in my tracks. What a well written song that was so apropos and memorable.",8
" One word to sum up this movie : Easy.
","I was really looking forward to watching this movie. Great cast, great global hype, and the feeling that it wants to go further than just a ""girly"" Barbie movie.<br><br>As a matter of fact, I was quite disappointed. While the message that is carried in this film is really important, I think that it was just to easy. It only talked about things we already knew, and not in a subtile or in a new way. I think it could have been so much more interesting and impactful. The scenario is also easy, you already know how it is going to end in the first 15 minutes. No surprises.<br><br>Nevertheless, I must mention the great cast, costumes, sets and music. But in the end, it's just a colorful feel-good movie, that is empty inside. Mid. 5/10.",5
" So much more than I expected
","No Spoilers:
I went for my daughter and a social 'ladies night' function our local cinema does for certain releases (missed them since COVID).<br><br>My expectations were of a funny movie about dolls based in a 'barbie world'. Basically Live Action Toy Story Barbie.<br><br>This movie was so much more than expected. It was thought provoking and gave a reflection of our society that women must endure and made way for conversations between mothers and daughters regarding how the world views women vs how they should see themselves. The idealistic Barbie world vs the real world was eye opening to young girls. The Barbie characters were diverse, intelligent and kind. The cameos, easter eggs and acting was fantastic too.<br><br>Brilliant movie.",10
" Intelligent treatment of a complex topic
","Anyone expecting a light comedy about the Barbie doll and her fans based on the title will be irritated. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach unroll a crazy story around a real Barbie, in which the social roles of women and men are reflected, partly wittily, partly very seriously. I recommend the film, especially for adults, since a certain general education and life experience are required to understand the many allusions to social phenomena. I very much enjoyed the quotes from earlier film classics, such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""The Godfather"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". A film worth seeing!",8
" Greta Gerwig is My Favorite Director
","I never had high expectations for the film due to the number of just-okay films that have come out this past year, but Greta never disappoints- Lady Bird, Little Women, and now Barbie! The movie is surely a Gerwig classic. It is amazing how the outright un-serious, campy film is able to tackle such serious and complicated real-world issues. Naturally, there is a satirical exaggeration of society to convey the point of the story but was executed with a conceptually clever approach. The writing carried witty humor, strong character development, and heartfelt experiences- all shined ever so brightly with the array of superb performances. Margot Robbie's performance throughout the film revealed the depth of such a character that can often be seen as superficial. The same can be said for Ryan Gosling's Ken. (SPOILERS) It is clear that everything Ken has done to Barbieland (""bringing patriarchy"") was in a way to shape his own sense of identity and self worth, what he feels he often lacks in Barbieland. The film features a multitude of well-known actors that portray a great deal of what a Barbie can be. The set and costumes bring viewers the nostalgia of their childhoods and how this life in a Barbie dream house (and her clothes) were extremely coveted by young girls. On the other hand, it shows how Barbieland is not all it is thought out to be. I was pleasantly surprised at how the dance numbers were reminiscent of old Hollywood sound-stage musicals that we never really see anymore. This film review would not be complete without an honorable mention to America Ferrera's performance. Her monologue's feminist themes are reminiscent of Saorise Ronan's monologue from Little Women. It was delivered at just the right pacing and intensity, resonating with audiences. While the message is not at all new, many women especially feel heard. The film does a wonderful job of blending the inclusive comedy with previous or subsequent scenes that make viewers tear up- the simultaneous laughing and crying sort. Overall, ""Barbie"" is a fun, glittery, social commentary satire about female identity; the feminism of hyperfemininity, authenticity, and community; and what it means to be human in our messed-up, chaotic world. For the Gerwig fans, Barbie lovers, Barbie haters, and everyone else, go watch Barbie.",8
" Overrated and scary
","I've never EVER wrote here on a movie. But now I just had to. Im 31 years old. Grew up with Barbie. So I guess im in the target group.<br><br>Visuals? 10/10.<br><br>But storyline and depth? 2-3. The feminism is strong throughout the movie but for me personally it gets mean. And the script is also changing too many times. I was happy in the beginning but then they changed what I thought the movie was about .<br><br>The movie was too long, the girls were mean and superficial, and when I thought Barbie have learned how to treat a man, she just strikes back with selfishness. Too long monologues, bad songs. Disappointed.",3
" Great story
","I really liked this film it is a pretty sensitive topic in a land of fun and rainbows I think it got the message through but had just the right amount of humor it also had a lot of great acting g from Ryan gosling and Margot Robbie I really like this film it's great for Adults and for kids even if the topic flies over their heads although I don't think the acting and the screenplay is all flawless I think there are some things they could've done to make it better for example in one scene when Barbie was in her car driving to the ""real world"" it was really glitch in choppy at least for my theater but I don't think that was intentional.<br><br>-Great film overall 8.5/10.",9
" Not bad, Not good
","I get the point but nah man! 7.5!!??<br><br>Yes women are supposed to be their own identity as men but I mean. Why was the ending so dull. At least I could have appreciated the life after the ""change"" it didn't have to be dull.<br><br>I have a big problem with classics ending so dull, unless there is a sequel...... If there is, A HUGE IF, at least you could have showed us how her life actually becomes normal.<br><br>I mean the movie in and of itself is a powerful message but the plot ending leaves a lot to be desired.<br><br>No spoilers but come-on!!!!!<br><br>Come onnnnn.<br><br>And at least you could have made it friendly for Kids!!!<br><br>Anyway I'm sure I'm one of the few adults who don't really like the whole set.",5
" So glad I went!
","When I heard that a ""Barbie"" movie was coming out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it, never mind watching it in an actual movie theatre. I had every Barbie doll as a young girl in the 60's, even Allen. Barbie was definitely NOT my role model, and I am thankful for the live women who were. My daughter went to see it with friends last week and convinced me to see it, because it wasn't what I would expect. I am so glad that I did not wear mascara! I was in tears laughing yet totally moved by the message. A movie that is both inspiring and funny is truly rare. The cast and the message were perfect. Talk about ""Girl Power""!",10

" Barbie is a human now
","I know that Barbie is for Toy Story 2 3 and 4 but this Barbie is something else like a doctor, a sports girl, a cow girl in the city. Barbie is being used as a toy. From the beginning of the movie the kids started to break tea cups, tables and baby dolls. Barbie went to ugly Barbie to go to the real world to find her kid. I surprised that Barbie had a memory of her kid who used to play with her that she doesn't n't like anymore. So Ken takes over Barbie island while Barbie lies down on the floor like a toy. Barbie and the other girls makes the boys go to war. The old lady and Barbie thought about a little girl who loved playing with Barbie so much.",8
" Don't waste your brain cells on this move
",I did not like this movie. I went because of the good reviews but I should have known it was all the hype. I went thinking it would be fun but it was a letdown. I almost walked out and expected more but it never happened. I can't believe that anyone would give this move a good review. It was so cheesy. The sexual undertones are a bit too much for many young kids I saw in the theatre. I would not take any children under 14 to this movie. This is definitely not a kid movie. I loved Margot Robbie in the Wolves of WallStreet and with Babylon a huge flop this is another big letdown. They spent so much money on advertising this film and it is no surprise to me now on why they had to spend so much money because this move would have flopped if they didn't spend so much money on advertising. Now after seeing it I am sick of seeing barbie.,1
" Barbie for one and all
","This movie was amazing both in the commentary it set out to say and the jokes. I'm not gonna beat around the Malbui dream house, the casting was on point and the references to some of the more obscure Barbie lore was appreciated. Ken also has some pretty fun scenes as well.<br><br>Now listen I've already seen reviews about how some people aren't happy about the commentary in the movie. Well guess what maybe that's the issue then. We have movies about war but that doesn't mean we are saying war is good. Overall I think there are alot of people who wanted this to be a comedy so bad that they missed the very obvious signs in the trailer that it was going to be more then that. The comedy is there to soften the slap of reality that yes women are still objectified and they aren't going to sugar coat it.<br><br>If this movie pisses you off because you think the plot is ""men bad, women good"" then you missed the point of Ken's story line and how he grew as a person. Grow up and learn to see beyond your 'Barbieland' where everything it's perfect for you cause it's not.",9

","Greta Gerwig brings the fun to the well known toy of generations, Barbie. Based on the trailers and interviews my hopes were high that it was going to be a fun and campy ride in the Barbie mobile. I would say it hit a few speed bumps. Women empowerment and understanding Barbie was spot on. Bringing in the discontinued dolls and ideas was brilliant. I feel the Kens' storyline was were the potholes were. Why can't it be Barbie's world and not so strong on a beating over the head that Ken is nothing. That Ken's only recourse is to take over? That Ken in the end, still isn't supporting Barbie as it should be. That might be controversial and some might say I missed the point, but I want my son to see it and come away with equality not that he should be diminished. If we want equality we need to model what a supportive boy/man should be. Partnership anybody?",8
" Optimistic and thought-provoking
","This was a great movie, far more moving than I expected it to be.<br><br>Barbie starts with a bang, paying homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also has a bit of a Truman Show feel but quickly goes in a different direction. Barbie has an existential crisis, incepted by a mother-daughter duo, and has to journey to the real world to restore the balance. Oh, and Ken (a marvelously complex character) tags along.<br><br>Our Barbie is optimistic, smart, kind, and just a touch naïve. She asks big questions. She's comfortable saying ""I don't know."" And yet as stereotypical Barbie, she self-identifies as *not* the most talented of the whole crew. This makes for some lovely dialogue in the hands of Gloria's character about what it means for a woman to be ""good enough."" As Barbie discovers this, we too discover a curious inversion. Barbieland---materially vacuous (no tea in the teacups, no ocean in the waves) yet substantively rich---feels like home. The real, messed up world feels so aseptically alien.<br><br>And the costumes and props are fantastically detailed. Great soundtrack.",8
" Best movie since Cruella
","A breath of fresh air from almost all movies made in the past 10 years. Great acting, amazing set designs and a wonderfully interesting story with a few twists! I've been so turned off with many of the movies made in the past 10 years due to poor storylines, and an extreme over abundance of CGI, which I'm guessing most people like because that's the bulk of movies nowadays. This movie had me smiling or laughing most of the time, with a few heartfelt moments which brought a tear or two to my eyes. Congratulations to the writer, producer, Director and cast as it was an amazing movie all around - loved it.",9
" I tried but I can't
","I did have a very high expectation for this movie but.. Sorry it was the worst movie I've ever watched. I tried to find the message from this movie but I couldn't. It seems like it tried to send a message move our hearts but it wasn't delivered to audiences. Because I have no idea what exactly they wanted to make. So what did they really want to make? Musical film? Comedy? Touching stories? Girls can do anything? Or just colorful cute movies? They mixed it all and added it all so the movie became just lame and cloudy..
I hoped the movie just could be more kitschy, tacky, easy, unrealistically happy and funny like 90s, 2000s movies.<br><br>I just felt sorry for Ryan Gosling and other actors and actresses.",1
" Amazingly funny
","I was positively surprise. I never write reviews, but I loved the movie. Was funny, the acting was amazing and it kept me so entertained ! Thank you Barbie! I really recommend everyone to watch it, I am happy I did.<br><br>The movie was moving, funny, deep, refreshing. The acting of Ryan Gosling was impeccable. But the whole cast did such an amazing job too.<br><br>The movie has comedy and touches of musical. Its a complete surprise. I would definitely watch it again.<br><br>If you are undecided and you think this is a kid movie. It is not. And it is worth the tome. You will leave happy.<br><br>Its Barbie and Its Ken !",8
" She's the whole world, he's just Ken
","The movie starts off well with a surprisingly clever and colorful depiction of Barbie's world. She drinks out of empty cups, showers under a waterless shower, can fly around as if transported by a hand just a like a real doll house. At some point, Barbie starts becoming a real woman by thinking about death, having cellulite and her feet flatten out. She goes into the real world to find the girl that broke the spacetime continuum and started to make her real.<br><br>All this time, we see lots of Barbies (all of them named Barbie) that have advanced degrees, are racially diverse, with different body types even. The Kens are brainless bodybuilders who don't have any occupation other than being pretty and overly infatuated with the Barbies. Ryan Gosling does an excellent job and portrays Ken perfectly which was surprising to me. Definitely an Oscar performance for the actor. Also Margot Robbie is absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking across the whole movie, a true real life Barbie doll who also plays the part perfectly. We also have basically half the cast of Sex Education and lots of references to other movies like: the Matrix, Pinocchio and maybe others which i haven't observed.<br><br>This being said, the problems start to pile up now cause all of the above is just a superficial sugar coating for the real reason of the movie: gender theory propaganda. The world is reduced to the patriarchy. When Barbie and Ken go to the real world, Barbie feels objectified and powerless and Ken starts understanding the patriarchy. While the real world is a true patriarchy the Barbie world is a true matriarchy. Long story short, Ken goes back to the Barbie world, establishes the patriarchy there and then Barbie and ""her owner"" go back to the Barbie world and reestablish the matriarchy. The movie is blunt and frankly disappointing in its portrayal of men and women. Men are nothing. Women are everything. Men, portrayed through Ken, don't have meaning, and are not supposed to have meaning in life, they just exist to be ""beach""-ing and simp over Barbies. Women on the other hand are everything: lawyers, teachers, senators, presidents, PhDs, scientists etc.<br><br>I dare the audience to think of the Barbie movie in reverse, women are nothing and men are everything. That would be an outrageous movies and the directors would be down right cancelled.<br><br>The movie does not present the true condition of being a woman today, but it just hates on men and wants them crushed and powerless in a sort of historical revenge. It reduced the world and the complex social dynamics between men and women to patriarchy. The movie it's divisive, destructive and does not solve any problems. I honestly felt like i was in an Orwell novel. It's a pitty, because the set was very good and had a lot of potential for something deep and meaningful, something that could have brought men and women together as a team. But instead it resorted to SJW, woke, extreme left ideology and apparently the audience was brainlessly having it.",4
" Brimming with Movie Magic, Barbie has Something to Say with High Concept Comedy
","The Barbie movie is fun, ridiculous, and surprisingly dense. The production design for Barbieland is a spectacle that must be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. If you like or have nostalgia for ""movie magic,"" go see this film, because the people who made it really handled the production with care. Hollywood went hard here, and it pays off.<br><br>Besides the spectacle, the script is pretty much nonstop jokes. I'm a middle-age guy, so my expectation going in was that I would have to cringe through some kids humor, but get to enjoy some more adult puns or double entendres a la ""I'll beach you off."" However, I was surprised by a very smart, fast paced, dense dialogue that matched my comedic sensibilities perfectly. I did notice, however, my fiancé and I were sometimes the only people in the theater laughing. So, your mileage may vary if this movie is not your type of funny.<br><br>Yes, the movie has something to say about feminism, patriarchy, and motherhood, but I appreciate it for that. It seems so many movies recently with beloved characters, like super Mario Bros, are safe and boring, and the stories go nowhere. So, for the Barbie movie to dig into these social topics, I think will make it iconic. Is it too meta and fast paced for kids to understand? Probably, but I think they'll find that appreciation for it 10 years from now when they rewatch it in college.<br><br>Finally, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are an absolute treat here. Both of them treat these silly roles as the most important work they've ever done. Their commitment here is insane. Any guy out there criticizing this movie because it's ""anti-men"" can learn a lot from Gosling about what it means to be secure with your masculinity.",9
" Loved every second of it
","Grandiose movie: colourful, lovingly staged, entertaining, definitely strange but never trashy. The actors are brilliant, the dialogue to the point and the set design fantastic. It had everything: I laughed, I was thoughtful, I cried. My husband was also thrilled. Great cinema has been achieved here, from which everyone can certainly take something away, whether they are Barbie fans or not. I was excited to see the film because of the director and for me Greta Gerwig's masterful skills have been confirmed. Thank you for 114 minutes of escapism without ever losing sight of reality. For me, the best film so far in 2023.",10
" An important feminist film exploring identity
","Never have i seen a film on the silver screen as loud and as proud of its feminist message as Barbie. Most movies half ass it, you can put the same recycled messages that are surface level in meaning and still pander to the male audience, cause no one's gotten the guts to actually give us a film with a story and characters that's truly for women. But that's just what Greta Gerwig does. This film wonderfully balances comedy and emotion, you'll be laughing as much as you'll be crying, especially if the message of this film speaks to you. A colorful set design devoted to capture the accuracy of playing with barbie dolls, a beautiful collaboration between several female artists, empowering the film's core of exploring one's identity as a woman in a male dominated society, and the talent of the film's lead actress, Margot Robbie along with the rest of the cast ties this film together into Movie of The Century.<br><br>My one critique on the film is that i find by that end of the film it was a bit too apologetic to its male characters. While it didn't diminish the film's core, I felt Barbie's message could've been amplified far more if they were less forgiving as the film shines light on the double standard placed on women, barbie doll or human.<br><br>Nonetheless, this movie is simply excellent. I found myself as a trans person who has went through his own existential crisis and struggle with identity coming out the theaters extremely happy with my barbie dolls from my childhood with me. Never would i thought i would find a film that spoke to me on such a personal level as many have.",9
" Really disappointing
","I had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release, however for me that's as good as it got, brilliant marketing. The first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring, leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just weren't that touching. I can see what they were trying to do with #girlpower but I found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to 'put ken back in his place' which I get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if you're trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power. I would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real 'dream world' looks like. The Speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film. At least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through.",3
" Smart, fun and touching!!! Ok
","The first 5 min 👌🏽!!!<br><br>Not a second of the movie looses your attention, it makes you think, laugh and even got a little tear out. It's full of irony and sarcasm, visually amazing. The level of detail on the toys, clothes, etc!!<br><br>If you think it's just a feminist movie, give it a chance, if your smart enough to understand and read into the details, it will make you se a different perspective on what's feminism actually mean.<br><br>I don't think it's inappropriate for kids however, they have to be certain age to understand the movie!<br><br>This is already pop culture icon, hopefully opening minds in every generation!",9
" Lack of plot and too much going on at the same time
",Listen as a woman in her 20s I am all for feminist movies but this movie really felt like a disappointment.<br><br>Went in with the expectation of something only to be disappointed.<br><br>The plot seems to be non-existent. Barbie has a crisis she goes to fix it but then it all becomes a mess. The dialogue feels like it's preaching rather than embodying the actual characters or the growth feels so non-existent<br><br>Half of the movie has me feeling overwhelmed and confused. It wasn't my cup of tea because of how obvious all the quotes felt. The director tried to create depth but there was no depth only this quote that felt so obvious making it even more boring.,5
" Who should watch Barbie
","Its fully a feel good movie with standard comedies, fantasy and adventure.<br><br>People who are seeing movies for entertainment they will definitely enjoy the movie.<br><br>Because this movie is full of entertainment.<br><br>Don't expect anything other than entertainment comedy.<br><br>People who are interested watching any other genres except this feels boring and waste of time.<br><br>In the fashion part the movie crew made a excellent work .The outfits are too cool both men and women.<br><br>The movie is enjoyable for all the age.<br><br>And the famous toy Barbie is shown in very impressive way that never disappoints any single Barbie lover.",8
" Not as expected
","A great film that shows both the hardship of real life and the beauty of life. Great film and unexpected .<br><br>I would highly recommend for any viewer , I felt the corny dancing and the meaningful actions made for a great cocktail.<br><br>I went with a mixed group of different ages and everyone enjoyed the film. Some found it meaningful and some found it comedic and slapstick.<br><br>The cast was one hundred percent perfect and I can't imagine a different Ken or Barbie. Ryan gosling played his part superbly and you could at times relate to his character and other times laugh at his mid fortune and dance routines.<br><br>Overall a great film.",9
" Best movie of 2023
","As a huge Barbie fan I was first sceptic, but as the movie trailers came out I got more and more enthousiastic. The movie was a big 10 for me. The jokes, the costumes, the actors, the atmosfere, it is all there!!!! Even the music is so nice with all the extras!<br><br>This movie definitely deserves Oscar's,<br><br>If you are a big Barbie fan you will understand the jokes even better! Especially if you are older than 30. It's fantastic! It is not really a movie for childrens, they will love the dancing and clothes and so but will not understand everything I think.<br><br>So if you want to have a good laugh! Go see this movie!",10
" Absolute rubbish!
","I went to see this movie having my expectations pretty high and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. Trust me I am no snob and I can enjoy simplistic movies just as much as sophisticated ones, but this one made me really angry. I had read all these amazing reviews full of wows and I really expected to enjoy it...I still don't get all these amazing reviews about a fantastic deep message the movie conveys or witty humour. The message filled with cliches was transmitted in a corny way, the jokes were not funny at all, the plot - very plain with no intrigue and imagination whatsoever. The conflict solution was something a kid could come up with, I thought the writing was very lazy. The movie was just boring. I thought it was just me but my husband felt the same way and my friends who went to see it after me, would say ""we wish we could unsee it"". Barbie was my all-time favorite toy that marked my childhood and teen years and I did really want to enjoy the movie, but I just couldn't. I only give it a 5 because of the visual part which was brilliant and I love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. But seriously... where all these amazing reviews come from? Or is it just ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" syndrome and people just don't dare to admit they see the king is naked?",5
" Capturing the experience of being a woman
","It was funny, gorgeously done and challenged people's view points which is a lot done for a movie made by a toy company. I found myself laughing and tearing up at certain points. I was in awe while watching it in the theaters for the attention to detail on props. It's insane how well made it is.<br><br>SPOILERS ISH ?? My only critique is the ending for the kens. We sympathise with them throughout the movie and the message is about equal rights for women. But feminism is about equal rights for everyone! Ken's deserve their freedom too. However it definitely did the job of making men step out of their comfort zone and understanding what it's really like to be a woman.",8
" Great setting of the Barbie world the plot underdelivered
","+
Margot Robbie was stunning, perfect acting. Everyone had excellent makeup and costume design that honors barbie origins. The setting of the Barbie house and other live versions of the toys was really great! The cinematography was nice, but nothing deep there. Loved the self roast of Mattel.<br><br>-
Humour didn't deliver. Ad for Birkenstock was a bit too in the face. Plot wasn't interesting, I feel like it could have worked in a more relaxed less politicised setting like original enchanted movie, but not in this framing. The feminist mottos were just taken from feminist Instagram accounts with mini comics, arts and inspirational phrases. I 100% read these exact quotes somewhere on Instagram which made it too simplistic I guess. And I feel like the show was so full of different messages that it failed to deliver every single one in a meaningful way that would stick. So it just ended up being generic and weak of a point. The whole travelling to the real world ended up not as exciting as I'd think it would be for a doll same for bringing people to the Barbie world, so many opportunities for funny and insightful comments missed.<br><br>The verdict is Overhyped.",4
" Great!
","Just amazing and a spectacular film for everyone of all ages. The cast and direction of the film were amazing! The set pieces and art direction was inspired. Additionally, the script was air tight and very funny. I cried and laughed throughout the film. I truly believe the movie will become a classic. The only reason it lost a star was because of some of the loose ends of the plot in the film. Overall the film was a great movie going event and extremely rewarding. I think Gerwig is very good at subverting audience expectations which makes the film more engaging. I would recommend this movie for everyone.",9
" Surreal and amazing
","From the opening scenes alluding to the greatest film of all time, this movie was captivating, witty, hilarious, aesthetic, philosophical, surreal, unapologetically feminine and feminist. Just masterful filmmaking that made every minute a delight to watch, and made you look forward to rewatching it. It pulled no punches in criticism of capitalism and patriarchy. I don't agree with Criticism that it was a commercial for Mattel since they clearly gave Greta final edit. Really don't can't think of a bad thing to say. But I do think that this movie felt like a cultural reset, that it has changed movies forever in the best possible way.",10
" A great popcorn movie!!!
",A popcorn movie I define as a movie that I don't need to take seriously or get to invested I can just sit back with my popcorn and enjoy it and that's exactly what Barbie was for me. I really just enjoyed getting into the barbie world and all it's quirks and joys. If your gonna do a barbie movie I believe this would be the best way to go about it. That being said I think there are some parts that I believe take you out movie a little and I felt at some points the movie struggled with trying to send a message. It was very on the nose and whilst that works at some points it took me out of it on others. Character wise I believe the casting was perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie I couldn't imagine anyone else and Ryan Gosling carried the film comedically. The supporting cast was amazing as-well and everyone played their part perfectly. Overall I would definitely watch this again and it was great joy to turn off my brain and just have fun with it :),8
" Colorful and educational, but weak plot renders it unexciting
","I think a film has value if it entertains and/or educates.<br><br>Barbie entertains with its bright and colorful sets,and its very humorous tongue-in-cheek jibes at patriachy and consumerism.<br><br>It educates by colorfully and humorously depicting the dangers and folly of stereotyping and consumerist attitudes.<br><br>To me, the above gives the film only mediocre value to the viewer because they are not accompanied by a strong plot.<br><br>In other words, society is filled with many and various alternative films with exciting plots and the educational messaging, so why would a viewer bother with this plot-deficient film?<br><br>Yes, Iknow the film's box office is huge (viewers did bother to see it), which prompts me to think that its reported $150m marketing spend was very effective. Thats what I call consumerism++.<br><br>Special mention to Ryan Gosling - he's a natural in this film; he played the part very well.",4
" Incredibly fun & easily profound
","I went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations, -even though I admire Greta Gerwig a lot- but not even fifteen minutes into the movie I was already laughing and crying and hooked. It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected.",8
" Perfect acting but zero story
","I struggle to comprehend the hype surrounding this movie. Apart from the political commentary and feminist themes it presents, I find it difficult to see the appeal. While the film boasts a cast of well-known actors and Margot Robbie's performance is commendable, the overall plot seems lacking in direction. Additionally, the quality of the special effects and CGI left much to be desired. The ending, in particular, struck me as one of the most nonsensical conclusions I've encountered. There is one positive aspect I can acknowledge - the movie successfully revitalized the brand and its color scheme for a female audience. This achievement can be attributed to the effective marketing strategy that propelled its success. If you would like, I can help you further develop and refine your thoughts on the movie.",3
" A enjoyable trip to Barbieland
","First of all, this film is not for everybody. Tho it should be, if we follow the principle this film is trying to teach us.<br><br>I loved the funny segments in this. They are always introducing some new gimmicky ways to make me laugh. The comedic timing in this is very well done and hits my spots exactly. It is right between ""we make a whole big sketch setup for the next scene, just wait one scene!"" and ""this is my catchphrase, laugh at it!"". Somehow they managed to pack that into every little part and dialogue. So props to that.<br><br>The overall message of this movie seems a bit preachy and too much. I can not describe how, it just did not catch me. It basically was the right tone and meaning for today, but the delivery is somehow a bit too 1990 for me. Basically I did not really felt the struggle of the main Barbie, but more of the support cast. They made the story feel more alive. Maybe that was the meaning of all of this. Eitherway it started a thought process in me, so I guess they hit the spot also in this regard.<br><br>I was not pleased with the song intermissions, which gave this film a less meaningfull tone than it could have been. Performances were great along the board.<br><br>So defintely a watchable experience with little laughs and moments to reflect. But not too much, so do not expect a lifechanging lecture on humans.",8
" Perfectly Fantastic...with one misstep
","This movie was wonderful. I went in with lowered expectations because I find the majority of big movies don't live up their hype. This was not the case here. Beautiful acting and message without being too pushy. It was very accessible; it didn't pander, and it didn't condescend. The dialogue felt very real and not scripted. SO much fun and tons of funny moments. The only thing I questioned was why the montage at the end didn't include some of the pain and sad moments of human existence. It sort of made Ruth saying ""I can't in good conscience..."" a strange thing to include. I'm hoping this will maybe make it into an expanded version?",9
" A human-plastic semi-egalitarian world
","Barbie, with a surprising amount of political undertones, will probably be one of the most surprising releases of 2023.<br><br>The movie showcases both sides of the coin, hyper-femininity and hyper-masculinity, with subtle jabs and character realisations throughout the entire film without becoming exhausting.<br><br>It's undeniable that Barbie is a female empowerment movie but it's one that everyone can get behind.<br><br>My only disappointments is that Micheal Cera got a marginal amount of screen time despite being the comedic punching bag, and it would of been nice to spend a little more time in Barbieland.<br><br>Everyone will have their own take on this screenplay, and it might take a few viewings to understand the messages that the film is trying to provide to the viewer, but by no means is this movie bad.",9
" Toxic and dumb
","The Barbie movie interested me at first. I wasn't expecting anything more than a silly movie with an interesting message, maybe it could've been a great way to show people the struggles of women in modern society, however this movie really disappoints.<br><br>Honestly, I was enjoying this picture very much around the first act, some jokes were landing, it was silly but it seemed to have no wish of making a statement. Barbieland seemed very far from reality, and that's what made it funny. Ken getting flown by the waves in the most unnatural way, just because he wants to prove himself, also his ""job"" is beach, I found that very funny.<br><br>However, I was expecting the real world to be a turning point in the movie, if the real world actually seemed tonally different from Barbieland or even seem real in any way, characters like Will ferrell's CEO of Mattel and the employees just make the real world feel as silly and dumb as Barbieland, though Will Ferrell is hilarious in this movie.<br><br>However I would let that one slide if it wasn't for other characters that feel dumb and just dumb, not funny. Like Sasha, who is a completely useless character that was introduced as this mean, depressed teenager that wants to harm everyone for no reason, however, she never again is presented this way. Somehow she is a nice girl later in the movie and even defends her mom in the rare instances of her actually saying something in the second to third act of the movie. Her mom, though, has a more important role, however she is one of the big elements that ruin this movie, her speech near the end of the second act feels like she's stating the obvious and not really making a difference, however, for some reason, everyone buys it, and Barbie no longer has depression. It looks like Greta has no clue how to express depression on screen.<br><br>Barbie tries to create emotional moments in a couple of scenes and in the very ending, which feel totally out of tone as I feel like Margot's character really doesn't have much depth and these scenes are dropped in the worst times, and are not impactful. It looks like Greta has no clue how to express depression on screen, as some moments that could've been sad are treated as jokes.<br><br>When Ken figures out about patriarchy and goes back to Barbieland is where this movie shows what its true message is. The Kens end up ruling Barbieland and all the Barbies get mind-controlled, except for Margot. But then the day is saved as all the Barbies take control of Barbieland once again and the Kens remain with no power whatsoever. I see this as Greta's moment of telling the audience that this movie is not for men, or she just truly believes men should shut up and let women do what they will, as equality truly is never a goal in this movie.<br><br>As the narrator says ""one day the Kens will have the same rights as women in the real world"", I noticed the hatred coming along. If Barbieland symbolizes something, it would be an utopia, the perfect society. However, instead of solving the problem of this ""utopia"" by giving power to Kens and creating a true perfect balance, it comes back to status-quo by keeping Kens powerless, showing Greta's real wish here. I feel it's a huge mistake as the movie brings up the topic of change halfway through while not making a good example, contradicting its own morals, if they were correct in the first place.<br><br>Barbie's character arc is not bad but it's poorly executed, it seems like it's all over the place and the writers didn't know how to develop her. Sometimes she is annoying, oftentimes she is dumb, but mostly her arc is based on her depression and how she feels. Though we don't really feel like her, and I get confused on how the depressed doll thing works, I'm really confused as no other depressed person ever played with a doll before, it seems like children are seen as dull and have no emotions that matter, because if the dolls reflect their personality, then they would be dumb and never question reality as the Barbies and Kens do. But Barbie is the only one that does, and this is why she turns into a human in the end, it's not a very emotional ending, it feels overly dramatic as the topics being covered and the tone of the movie doesn't build up to this moment. But Barbie now living in the real world is fine, it just isn't anything special.<br><br>Overall this movie instigates hatred and is doing this at this very moment in real life, the polarizing nature of this movie is clear here. It's lack of self-doubt and the need of proving itself correctly while not being right whatsoever makes us, who didn't enjoy the movie, turn into the villains, as our opinion becomes irrelevant and can be refuted with simply: ""I bet your favorite movie is The Godfather"". I'm not trying to pick any side as I'm just giving my opinion. I respect all opinions and expect people to do the same.<br><br>This movie could be fine in its own right if it wasn't for the toxic and sheer irrational nature that it generates, which is a reflection of our society and the hatred we keep inside and, often, only let it out in movies such as this one. Though I'm looking forward to more new ideas like this one, as the industry is starting to come back with inventive and creative pictures that bring people to the cinema and generate revenue, just hoping to be better movies next time. Barbie(2023) 3/10.",3
" Pink rules
","I really enjoyed this movie. Every Barbie that I grew up with gets featured (No, I did not own them all). I love the story and the fact that all ages can get something out of it, which made it feel even more relateable.<br><br>The story does have it flaws, but are quite foregiveable I think.<br><br>I know some people are complaining about the characteristics of Ken, but if you were into Barbie in the 80's, you would know that Ken has always been as he is displayed in the movie. He never was GI Joe, that is for sure.<br><br>I love the fact of the deeper layer and message in the film. I will recommend it to anyone that is open to the pinkness :)",8
" Worse Barbie Movie EVER!!!
","I grew up watching Barbie, my kids watched every Barbie movie. This was AWFUL! Extremely dumb, language was uncalled for (mother Bleep, vagina, penis, I'd like to see the blob in his jeans), on top of Mattel being made something it isn't. Where are all the other Barbie characters? Ryan, Raquelle, Summer, or her little sisters? At many points I was either yawning or asking myself why am I continuing to sit through this? I took up for the movie and told people it couldn't be that bad they were just being too judge-mental. Na I was wrong! It's terrible and I can't say that enough. You failed us!!",1
" I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world...
","While not seeing previous Greta Gerwig's movies might have been a mistake on my side, starting exploring her filmography with Barbie (2023) was surely quite an interesting choice. Honestly, I was a little scared and worried about finally seeing this film - after so much hype on Twitter and other social media it would be disappointing finding out that the movie is not a 10/10 masterpiece. Eventually, I decided that no matter how bad (or good) Barbie actually is, at least I will have the pleasure of seeing Ryan Gosling's astonishing face (and body) on the big screen. The first few scenes of the film absolutely captivated me with their doll-like, plastic pink aesthetic, showing Barbieland as a perfect, colorful paradise. I have to admit though, once our two main characters travelled to the real world, things got a little cheesy. Of course I didn't expect Barbie to be deep or dramatic, but for me it fell into the family toys-come-to-life movie cliche a little bit too much. However, I really liked the comedious aspect of the film, all the references to history of the Barbie doll and others. I might as well say that Barbie became my new comfort movie, something to watch with your best buds, or even a loved one.",8
" Exceeded my expectations!
","I just saw the barbie movie this day and in a few words I can say that it exceeded my expectations that I had about this movie.<br><br>First of all, the performance of all the characters in general is more than decent, and I also feel that it had a perfectly planned plot, since I consider that no scene is out of context or just filler, which is something that happens very often in movies these days.<br><br>Also another aspect to highlight is that the film in general is still entertaining for audiences of all ages, since it contains humorous phrases and references that make the film more attractive to people.<br><br>Finally, the main reason why I liked this film so much was that it leaves you with a very deep message, since this film touches on very sensitive issues that represent the defects of the human being, and this film leaves us a message that we are all equally important and that we must not let ourselves be carried away by society's stereotypes.",8
" One of the greatest movies of all time
","I am not kidding, the movie was hilarious, self aware, touching, camp, beautiful, it was everything. My friend told me it was rare to hear me laugh so much, next to us was a couple and the bf was also dying from laughter. The ""this movie is not for me"" means that you maybe are close minded, if you go to see anything with prejudice, you will more likely not enjoy it. I think it is fair if it isn't your cup of tea but don't review bomb the movie, there nany famous movies that are not for me but i don't think they are bad. Why can't women, mothers and daughters have something for them? All those 1 star reviews are disgusting. I recommend to put the pinkest thing you own and enjoy the movie, i am glad i watched her.",10
" It's good for an evening with popcorn in front of the TV
","Going to the cinema is a waste of money if you just not want only watch Margot. Barbie certainly had the potential for an original and fresh adventure musical, but alas. Unfortunately, even well-chosen actors, well-written songs or an original and fresh visual cannot save a completely tragic scenario.<br><br>A mess of banal clichés and a completely wasted opportunity. With such a budget, a cast and an interesting iconic toy, it should have been handled better.<br><br>The film has a very interesting and brisk first half, but from the second it drags on at a disgusting pace.<br><br>Even worse is the completely inappropriate, overblown and absurd push towards feminism.",4
" Fun and heartwarming
","When I first walked into the cinema to watch this movie my first expectation is just for it to be funny and fun pink bling bling stuff but I should've expected a more deeper meaning to this movie when it's a Greta Gerwig movie.<br><br>And what even more interesting about this movie is when you watch this at the first half you would think it is solely about woman empowerment and stuff but at the end it really does explain about man's feeling and insecurities as well. The introduction of patriarchy towards Ken is such an amazing and fun scene to watch. Ryan gosling is such a good actor to play the himbo role since you can enjoy his character despite how he portrayed the toxic masculinity role so well.<br><br>But I wanna focus more on my point of view as a woman myself here. Watching this movie as someone who's childhood revolves around Barbie doll brings so much nostalgia and make me realize how it plays a huge part in my journey as a woman. The transitions from being a little girl to a woman is spot on. It touches about insecurities and the man's expectations of a woman and many more crucial problems.<br><br>It is so woman empowering and the message is quite obvious and delivered pretty strongly and straight forward in the scripts. But I couldn't deny the scriptwriting really touches my heart and makes me wanna cry. But i still wish it was being potrayed and conveyed more subtly as it will be more fun for viewers to interpret the message itself but I understand that this Barbie movie's targeted audience could be from all range of age so the message should be crystal clear.<br><br>It's just some people might think that this movie is solely forcing an agenda. Like as a woman I get this whole messages but for someone else it might be coming off to strong and seems pretty stereotypical feminism BS which is a hard pill to swallow but we all know certain people in our society will have that kind of opinion when they saw the movie. That's why I wish it comes more naturally, thats all. But I think the ending make up the whole strong message about feminism earlier with how its was not just about that.<br><br>Like I said the movie also touches about the whole experience as a human no matter what their gender are and how we're flawed but that's just what life is.",9
" Barbie
","Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) wakes up everyday in a pink world with all the other Barbies who have all attained top societal roles as doctors, astronauts, the president etc all supported purely as accessories by a series of dumb Kens - including Ryan Gosling. Robbie's Barbie however starts thinking about things she shouldn't, including death, and seeks advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) who says that someone in the real world is having these ideas and she must go there and sort things out, which she tries to, accompanied by Gosling.<br><br>Before I went to see this, I never really really understood what this was supposed to be about or what it was trying to say. Having now seen it and hopefully understood things a bit better there are elements that still confuse me a bit. Ok, the battle of the sexes is tackled very nicely with deft explanations around woman still clearly having a more difficult time in a modern world of supposed settled equality plus the distinction between reality and the need for fantasy is well played. However, whilst it appeared to make a lot of sense and told its tale well, I still left the cinema with a bit of a confused frown on my face as ultimately men and women still seem as bad as each other in their attempts to outdo each other - was that the idea? Still, I must say I thought it was on the whole fun and original film with 2 fine performances and Gerwig has cleverly brought the 2 worlds nicely together. I guess it really is a unique film and one I think I need to see again one day to check out everything I must have missed - most odd and clever rather than likeable.",5
" Entertaining if a Bit Feministic
","Went into this movie knowing it'd be hilariously awkward. Robbie as Barbie and Gosling as Ken. Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories. My only hope is that this destroys Mission Impossible at the box office so we can witness Barbie defeating Tom Cruise. Worth a watch and probably a re-watch once it goes up for rent digitally.",8
" Emotional and Thought Provoking
","As someone who never grew up with dolls, somehow Barbie ended up teaching me the most. The movie was not only fun and enjoyable but full of philosophy and questions of patriarchy and the functioning of present society.<br><br>In this movie, you don't just sit around or try to explore through different apps but learn, a lot.<br><br>Greta Gerwig has did it again, with the script and her direction as she gets into the character. It made the film what it was supposed to do, a enjoyment for a child watching, a nostalgia for older generation and for us a place to finally feel seen not for reels, but for fun, knowledge and all the questions. I would recommend watching it with your family and have a Barbie day out of it.<br><br>Theme: Pink.",8
" Fun but occasionally confused with itself.
","I'll start with the issues, because overall this movie was enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously.<br><br>The majority of the movie is a lighthearted comedy. The biggest tool a comedy has to use for conveying societal criticisms is satire. The beauty of satire is that you can make some really good points. When the movie used satire to make it's points it was great. But the 5% of the time that it forgot about the comedy altogether and tried to take itself too seriously (I'm not saying the subject itself matter wasn't serious) conflicted with it's own tone. You can make all the points you want to make with a biting satire without stomping on your own tone.<br><br>The ending for Barbie was felt misguided. Without spoiling it, there's a point between when the final conflict is resolved and the very last scene of the movie where barbie experiences something. It looks like the scene is supposed to be deep and insightful, but it honestly felt like the writers got to that point in the movie and didn't know how to end it, so they just kinda piled on some abstract feelings and vague phrases for a transition. Sort of like a high schooler writing an essay and not knowing how to write a concluding paragraph.<br><br>The middle school girl character is a 1 dimensional character, but writing young children characters seems to be a challenge for Hollywood so you can't blame them too much. And lastly the whole car chase scene was a blatant Chevy ad to the point that it was almost funny itself.<br><br>Now the good:
The visuals and characters were all done really well, and not just Robbie and Reynolds but the rest of the cast. The movie itself was really entertaining and worth a watch.",8
" One of the worse movies I've seen in the last decade
","Barbie is a film that left me thoroughly disappointed from the very first scene to the closing credits. The film's overall execution was subpar, and there were a few elements, in particular, that stood out as particularly frustrating. Firstly, the storyline felt disjointed and lacked depth. It failed to engage the audience or maybe it did but it went nowhere with it, making it difficult to invest in the characters or their journey. The pacing was inconsistent, causing the narrative to drag at times and rush through critical moments at others. Secondly, the two lead characters, lacked the charisma and development necessary to carry the message of the film. Their interactions often felt forced and devoid of chemistry, making it challenging to root for their relationship. Overall, Barbie fell short of expectations in terms of plot, character development, and engagement. It left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and regret for investing my time in this cinematic endeavor I regret inviting my friends to watch it. It could have been a movie with a great message. This film, unfortunately, missed the mark on delivering an enjoyable and memorable experience.",1
" Has issues but overall good movie
","Acting is good, Margot did an amazing job at portraying Barbie even though Ryan as Ken absolutely stole the show to be honest. Humour wasn't amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times. Plot is slightly messy, not horrible, like I get it but the movie didn't really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects. Another thing that bothered me was the waste of Will Ferrell's character who could have been a better ""villain"" that simply an incapable clown. I still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because it's execution, cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a ""masterpiece"".",8
" Some Good, Some Bad
","Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are most charming and superb in their roles as Barbie and Ken. Also here and there are some really funny and entertaining scenes, but the ""message"" (you know all that blabla about patriarchy and matriarchy and all the cliches regarding gender from a certain point of view) drag the whole movie rather down - at least for me. For sure the movie is one great coup by the marketing team of Mattel to fit and place Barbie World into the currents of today's zeitgeist (like all those Barbie dolls they sell these days that are inclusive) - I take any bet, the sells will rise these days profoundly. Anyway, if you are in the mood for comedy and can cope with those ""preachy elements"" especially in the second half of the movie, you may find some good entertainment (like I did), but if you are really fed up with such ""progressive"" matters, you should avoid watching this one. Because of Robbie and Gosling and some fine settings and scenes this movie does not crash but Barbie is without doubt just another most hyped affair by the media, and the plot rather a very predictable one, if you think about it.",5
" Very nice!
","A good movie with an important message that is delivered in a way that makes it easy to understand and can resonate with alot of people. Hopefully the way they delivered the message leads people to see the issues they depict in the movie.<br><br>I truly recomend this movie to everyone who likes ""kids"" movies that also has a good message. The way that the Barbie world was created leads the viewer to be sucked into the world of Barbie. Also the references and homages to other movies and also Barbie sets and movies really sets the cake.<br><br>A bonus point is that all of Kens lines in the movie is comedy gold and made the whole theater giggle a few times.",8
" Excellent
","We went into this not knowing what to expect. We are writing this review as two straight cis gendered male and female. It is easy to take it at face value and it to be what you want it to be. But the truth is it does not provide the viewer with a straight answer.<br><br>At it's core this film is about female identity but ultimately encapsulates how men and women fit in the modern world and their place in it. The film was very layered and brilliantly nuanced so the audience was really asked to reflect on its messages. This film treats its audience intelligently. It's portrayal of Feminism is a well rounded take on the female experience and role in society.<br><br>The one criticism would be that the men's experience is a lot more 2D, having said that we in no way saw it as an attack on men. In fact you could argue it took a sympathetic view of men's current experience in society and the pitfalls of popular alpha male masculinity and loss of identity.<br><br>The question is not just around gender roles or stereotypes but from an individual experience which is encapsulated at the end (spoilers) from Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings characters personification of strong female and male figures.<br><br>We would highly recommend for a profound intimate portrait of our times. We have not watched a movie that has provoked so much debate on leaving the cinema.",10
" barbie girl
",Im a barbie girl in a barbie world. Life is plastic and its fantastic. Really good. Meta. And a fun time with the family. There's a lot more i want to say. Ryan gosling was funny and good and its nice to see asian representation . It's not as funny as i thought it was going to be but it had a lot of meaning. Women empowerement. Greta Gerwig is always a good one and maerogt robbie definitely is perfet for the role of barbie. I cant think of anyone else. I was a little cringing at some people going and wearing pink but overall everyone had a good time and i think familys would enjoy it and its better than oppenheimer.,9
" Camp is fun, being beaten over the head isn't
","The camp in the movie was creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 10/10. Having a character yell at you for two minutes about how hard being a woman is isn't creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 1/10.<br><br>But I still did love the movie. I was laughing throughout most of the movie. The sets, the costumes, the small jokes were all so wonderful. The Barbie world feels totally separate and complete. Ryan Gosling was really the star of the movie for me. Every moment he was on screen I loved it. The moments I didn't love, were really hard to get through. I loved the take of Barbieland being a total matriarchy, but I really didn't need to be beaten over the head with a stick for two minutes to get the point they were trying to make.",5
" A Invigorating Exploration into the Human Condition
","After watching the trailers, promotional materials and interviews I had very high hopes for this film, especially when looking at Greta's other work. I was not disappointed.<br><br>I went to see it at the cinema with my partner the first weekend of its release, and before I had even sat in my seat I was already impressed. Over half the audience were families with young children, dressed up and holding their own barbie dolls. The rest were couples, older people, groups of young lads, and friends. The majority of the audience were sporting pink, and there was a real buzz of excited chatter in the air that I can not recall ever experiencing to this extent before a film. I think this is a testament to the entire creative team, to manage to produce so much excitement among so many different types of people is a feat I have not personally witnessed accomplished in my entire adult life.<br><br>The opening scenes were outstanding. The introduction to barbie struck me on an emotional level, and perfectly set up the characters of the film. The introduction to Barbie left me reminiscing of my own childhood experiences of playing with the dolls, and managed to perfectly capture the excitement that was to come.<br><br>I really enjoyed how some things were left unsaid, and your imagination had to do the groundwork. In a film made to appeal to both children and adults, often most aspects are over explained and nothing is left up to interpretation, yet Barbie managed to ask questions it did not provide complete answers for, whilst still maintaining accessibility for its entire audience.<br><br>It had some really imaginative sequences and routines that ensured the film had constant sparkle. The choreography and set design complimented these aspects beautifully.<br><br>There were really touching moments on humanity, feminism, society and relationships, without villainizing Ken (Men), which would have been an easy cop out.<br><br>It was also oozing with comedic value, Robbie and Reynolds were hilarious, and brought a youthful exuberance to their respective roles. None of the jokes fell flat, and there were many moments where I was laughing out loud in the cinema.<br><br>I will say that the casting of the mother and daughter did not feel as strong, and that there were some scenes of product placement that felt really forced and did briefly take me out the film.<br><br>Additionally, I felt the film did not really know how to finish its story, and the last 30 minuets were weak compared to the rest of the movie.<br><br>Despite these criticisms, I absolutely adored the film. A more honest reflection would probably lead me to score it 8/10, however, personally, the relationship I had with Barbies in my own childhood strengthened my appreciation for the film.<br><br>It was funny, touching, exciting all whilst being really quite sad. I laughed and I cried.<br><br>I would recommend this film to anyone, as I feel that all people going to see it with an open mind will find that they authentically enjoy it.<br><br>Thank you Greta, for taking me back to my own childhood, and capturing those big questions that begin in our youth on the big screen.",9
" Great potential ruind by poiticising everything
","Great costumes and set, but the Barbie land was not fully exposed instead they chose to make every single scene in the movie a political stand. After half an hour is stared to feel like ever other generic Hollywood movies. Everyone in the movie theatre was trying so hard to enjoy the movie, but all there expectations were crushed. No one laughed at the supposedly funny scenes. It was a dread. Dude people go to a Barbie movie to have fun, we have social media to preach about political issues everyday. Everyone fighting for every minute sign of offensive remarks. News anchors and politicians virtue signalling. Where will people go to have fun, Hollywood deserve to go broke.",1
" Surprisingly good 😊
","How I Saw It... Barbie.<br><br>From the opening notes of Also Sprach Zarathustra, an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's The Dawn of Man, I was impressed. I knew that Gerwig was going take me for subversive ride on Barbie roller-coaster.<br><br>Greta's humour and satire are in fine form.<br><br>One scene tugged at my heart: Barbie (Robbie) is sitting at bus stop, and makes eye contact with an elderly woman, and says in absolute awe, ""You're beautiful.""
The woman looks at her and says matter-of-factly, ""I know it.""<br><br>She succeeded tearing down the stereotypical Barbie image, and replacing it with real woman. No small feat.",9
" YOU ARE KENOUGH!!!!!!
","Barbie is an amazing film that mixes comedy and emotional moments skilfully. All the performances are perfect, except for Ryan Gosling who was exceptional at playing himself. I will cry if it doesn't win an Oscar, if not for I'm Just Ken it should be for the phenomenal set design. The costume department really worked their socks off as every character feels unique in its style yet cohesive. The writing was very well thought out and barely gives you a second to catch your breath. Now the star of the show Margot Robbie. I could have wrote a whole review just on her performance. Although we all know her as a very talented actress, she was definitely built for this role. Michael Cera made a great comeback with this role, and was mine and many others favourite part of the film. Also shoutout to Rob Brydon as Sugardaddy Ken!",9
" Funny, genuine, emotional and pink.
","With some of the greatest casting seen in a film (looking at you, Alan), this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch. Maggot Robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism, anxiety and true ennui. She questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out. Ryan Gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery, understanding and empathy. Incredible costumes, sets, choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen. Great Gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion, making us all wonder if the power of Barbie can truly help to heal the real world.",8
" Disney channel level movie.
","First, let me say there are some laughs in this movie and I enjoyed some of the comedy. Absolutely fun for kids and family (minus the sexual innuendos and sexual jokes). Honestly I believe this movie is making money cus of the brand alone. Visually this movie is appealing. Yes. Absolutely. Straight out of the toy stores and out of the Barbie toy boxes. Story wise this movie is a dump. Mediocre at best. Feminist heavy which is fine, but the story itself is what makes it a dump. It makes no sense. If you're expecting a Lego movie or Free Guy type of reveal, there is not one. The humans literally just cross over to ""Barbieland"" and Barbie herself is able to stay in the ""human"" world which is apparently a skip and a jump away from the city. This makes the movie seem like it's Disney channel material and not really Disney theater material. It's a Barbie movie so I wasn't expecting much but to not explain why and how everyone is able to just crossover to ""Barbieland"" is bad writing. The main character draws a sad Barbie and it makes Barbie in the nearby very real ""Barbieland"" sad. Barbie can somehow feel her emotions. So with no explanation why, Barbie is supposed to be a doll but is also real and has a connection to this woman who's works for Mattel and draws Barbie in her free time. Mattel CEO's can also crossover to ""Barbieland"" and it's normal. This side of the story is terrible. Aside from the obvious feminist storyline there is no other story that makes sense. It's all just Disney channel silliness. The final scene serves no purpose other than to serve for another inside sexual joke. So dumb.<br><br>The Oscar talk surrounding this movie is absurd. As a real movie, it's a terrible movie. While Gosling is funny here, should he be nominated for playing a silly, sad Ken doll? Literally anyone could have played these roles. There was nothing Oscar worthy in these performances. Gosling has turned in some great performances in his career but this is just not one of them. Nominating him would be equivalent to nominating Kurt Russell for his role in Sky High. Nothing outstanding.<br><br>Of course women and little girls will find this movie entertaining. Thanks to nostalgia and the visually appealing sets it will connect with most females. Is it really Oscar worthy? I'd say no. There is no real acting done in this movie. Nominating this movie for anything other than visual, costumes and/or sets, would be an insult to the actors that have truly acted in some amazing roles.<br><br>Should you watch this movie? Sure. Why not. Like I said it's visually appealing and is funny, and is feminist heavy. Most women should and will most likely enjoy this movie. Anyone with a sense of story telling, might not. I would suggest watching Free Guy, and the Lego movie. Much better stories being told there that actually do make sense.",3
" Fantastic
","Pretty simple. Anyone trying hard to explain why this movie would be any less than 8 stars is trying too hard to be a fake internet movie critic. Thoughtful, quirky, funny, fresh.<br><br>Far from being heavy-handed, the movie successfully entertains while still being obvious in its message.<br><br>It's amazing that actors who are portraying plastic versions of stereotypes are able to create individualized characters. The characters in the real world are surprisingly more nuanced and realistic than would be expected, especially when juxtaposed against the Barbie World characters. Just enough realism - and over-the-top comedy - in this film to balance the obvious messaging.<br><br>Watch it, enjoy it, accept that it's a spectacular film.",10
" Mediocre at best
","I had high expectations as a result of the media press, however these we're crushed from the start.<br><br>First of all, I did expect it to feel a little generic and cheesy although all I could feel throughout the movie is that it was rushed and cheap. The storyline was dry and over-political.<br><br>I'd have liked to see more LGBTQ+ representation and breaking stereotypes, as it felt like just a generic film. Even the Barbies were considered stereotypes!<br><br>Comedy throughout was limited and wasn't engaging at all - sometimes trying too hard to emphasise feminism and going too far in the opposite direction to the world is heading in (I'm not encouraging patriarchy).<br><br>However, I did find the music quite good (especially the Billie Eilish song) and did redeem the movie a little bit.<br><br>In summary, the movie was mediocre at best and there's not much to discuss. It felt like a cheap version of movies like Spirited and The Greatest Showman with no real emotion.",4
" Thank you for this movie
","I feel like I have never watched anything like this before. Its so original, witty, entertaining, satiric, while also dealing with some important and serious issues culturally. I would recommend everyone to watch it, and Im so happy that this exist for future generations to come, to grow up with. It hits so many issues spot on, and with so much humor at the same time. I've never seen these feminist issues being taking up, in such a good way and in such a popular big art piece.<br><br>Ryan is amazing in this, and definitely steals the scenes!<br><br>The only thing i missed, and why its not a 10 for me (but 9+) is because I would have loved to have seen more real-life struggles, when they are in the real world - or that it just be more real, tough, like what the real world can be, so we understand more why it can be hard to be a women in todays world, like they mention later in the film.<br><br>But overall, loved it and love that this exists now. Thank you Greta and Margot, and the whole team!",9
" Not At All What I Expected
","My girlfriend and I went to see this movie last night on the day of release because she was so excited for it. Going into it, I had my doubts... I was pleasantly surprised.<br><br>The attention to detail was truly amazing, the colourful Barbie World, the way the dolls moved and interacted with objects, the references to less popular and discontinued Barbie dolls.<br><br>I thought that the comedy in the movie was going to be completely cringe worthy. However, the movie was actually funny. There was not any point that I felt that they were trying too hard to make the movie funny or anything like that. There was just the right amount of humour for a movie like this.<br><br>The adult humour was a bit of fun too, fair to say that I did get a good amount of laughs whilst watching.<br><br>Allan (one of the discontinued Barbie Doll models) was my favourite character throughout the movie. Though his role was fairly small and he was there for a bit of comic relief, he was funny and also somewhat relatable.<br><br>I appreciate that this movie is not for everyone, that being said, I do think that there will be many mixed reviews about this movie.<br><br>I for one have nothing bad to say about the movie, my girl and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that she walked out of that movie much happier than when we walked in.",8
" Fresh, Fun, Feminist & Fascinating
","I was mostly expecting a fun comedy but this turned out to be such a superb meta monster, the likes of which I hadn't seen since original Deadpool movie... And then the cast, script &amp; visuals of Barbie went farther into some insightful, biting &amp; modern thematic territories.<br><br>Ms Robbie &amp; Mr Gosling shine exceptionally well and play flawlessly together. Hell, all the cast is sublime. I usually dislike Mr Farrell's antics but even they worked perfectly here. This has rightfully become the box-office king of the year (So far at least) and I truly hope it can also shine during the awards season. I know it's hard to include something called freaking Barbie among the end of the year awards / prestige selections but goddammit, this Barbie DESERVES it.",9
" Barbie-not good
","The only reason this movie even gets a 2 from me is because Margot Robbie is a beautiful woman. It's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. A waste of money to see. Will Ferrell plays his usual ridiculous self as all of his roles. Ryan Gosling also has a role that is beneath him. Margot Robbie is a great actress and so much more capable than this role. A definite don't see this movie. It should have an age rating no one over the age of eight years old allowed unless accompanied by a toddler. Yes, it was that bad. An embarrassment to all who acted in this movie. The writers should be ashamed. This may be all that Hollywood is capable of during a writers strike. Hopefully there will not be a sequel to this God awful movie. I only saw it because my wife wanted to see it for some strange reason. I would have to say it's the worst movie I have ever paid to see hands down. So not waste your time or your money to go to this movie. Wait for it to go to video. It shouldn't take long.",2
" Witty and laugh out loud funny
","I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a while. From the opening sequence (I won't give it away but it's a scream) it's clear that you're in for a wild (and self-aware) ride.<br><br>The bold anachronisms (e.g. Elaborate dance numbers against brightly colored backdrops and lighting straight out of Singing in the Rain) amidst the hilariously on-the-nose social commentary reminds me of La La Land, in that it lovingly recalls tropes from years ago, while tacitly acknowledging that changing social mores require us to critically examine those tropes even as we celebrate them.<br><br>Also, I found the character arcs, and the way they resolve, original and genuinely affecting. Gender expression is obviously a huge theme of this movie (and there is an absolute corker of a joke about men who like The Godfather that is a little too accurate) but the lessons learned by the female leads felt resonant to me (a cishet man) and I was really touched, but the film (thankfully) never gets saccharine. It's clear to me that Gerwig respects her audience's intelligence.<br><br>I will 100% watch this again.",8
" It's OK
","As a woman and a feminist I was disappointed by this. The actors were great - Margot and Ryan doing their best - but they can only work what they're given and the ""story"" was wafer thin and made no sense. This would have been OK if it was a movie aimed at kids but it wasn't and I would imagine children would be bored even quicker than I was. It's lovely to look at, the clothes and sets replicating the Barbie world so beautifully but it's very much style over substance and the jokes are laboured and repetitive. If it was just a lighthearted giggle for the girls I would have enjoyed it more but the second half is full of dreary speeches and millisecond cameos (Rob Brydon) that added nothing but a nod to the cleverness of the directors research skills.",5
" Mature humour mixed with absolutely beautiful scenes
","Barbie lives in a perfect world.<br><br>When she discovers the real world, she realises that people age, have depression, family issues, and do not see the world as a perfect place that they want to be in everyday.<br><br>This theme of Barbie coming to terms with what it means to be a human, with both the lows and the highs, is what leads to some truly beautiful scenes that make the room freeze. I saw the movie in a packed venue, a couple hundred people all munching crisps and children rustling and asking questions.<br><br>During these scenes, everything was silent. No one moved, ate, or talked.<br><br>As for the rest of the movie, it was great. If you're just looking for a good movie, this is one. Plenty of humour and the soundtrack is amazing, an instant save on Spotify. The dance sequences, especially the ones with Ken, are a feast for the eyes. The movie touches on the idea that you dont have to be perfect or the best. You dont have to be a lawyer/doctor, or a celebrity, or a nobel prize winner. There is nothing worng with just being average.<br><br>The only thing stopping me from rating higher is a personal itch with the movie - the main part of the movie is Barbie dealing with a male dominated society (patriarchy) and all the issues women face in that. I don't mind the concept, but after the movie I wished that wasn't the main focus. It would have been a masterpiece 10/10 of a movie if it had focused on the problems of the human soul (sadness, loss, regret) and the joys of human life (raising a child, friends, finding happiness in the worst places) instead of ""boys vs girls"".<br><br>Lastly, I would recommend a word of caution for any parents taking children to see it - it is rated a 12+ (at least in the UK) and thats solely due to the sexual undertones and jokes thrown around. Nothing terrible, but could be slightly uncomfortable.<br><br>The hype surrounding the movie paid off, I'm glad I watched it.",8
" Its literally me
","I enjoy the time watching this, because the details are there and represent a lot the experience we all live in our time. Besides the work of ryan and margot in this movie conveys a higher level of feeling, a feeling you can't describe, you feel the conection between them and you. It really argues about feelings and social deconstruction, and in the work doesn't show a treat any of the genders superior to others, in reality there is a dependency between genders that is easily evidenced, talks about the importance of knowing how to value oneself as a person and it is evidenced in the relationship between Barbie (Margot) and Ken (Ryan), in which Ken has a dependency on Barbie in which he cannot exist without her, which is reflected in our society.",9
" Touching yet funny
","I know this review is like a month late but if you haven't already watched barbie you really should. I thought this would be a fun or child like movie but I ended up crying at the end. I found it very heartwarming, it's genuinely a good movie. In this movie Barbie try's to find her true self while wondering what her worth and purpose is and understand herself. It also has some funny jokes I liked in the movie. I think this movie is an absolute masterpiece, both funny and sad. I would personally rate this movie ten out of ten especially if you're into heartwarming and I guess somewhat relatable. I highly recommend this :).",10
" Mwah... not that funny?
","Went yesterday to the movie theaters to saw Barbie after i read a lot of positive reviews. However, it was not my cup of tea. I saw sometimes a funny moment (most of the time because of Will Ferrell) but the other jokes were a bit cringe. I guess the target audience is focused on woman instead of men? In my theater the woman had a laugh and the men kinda waited for it to end...<br><br>What else? I dont know. Margot and Ryan gave their best and they did pretty alright.<br><br>The big message that the movie wanted to bring over was a bit long over explained. I am not sure i understood it in the end... also... was not sure i even bothered to give it any thinking.<br><br>In the end i just wanted to go home.",5
" Amazing
","I haven't written a review on IMDb before but I felt like I need to for this film.<br><br>Genuinely one of the most heartwarming yet emotionally poignant movies I've seen for a very long time, and honestly the first movie I've genuinely felt understood by.<br><br>It made me laugh it made me cry, I never expected the Barbie movie of all things to stick like it did and strike a chord with me. This is a movie that links directly into my experiences as a woman and perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to be under the societal pressures of being a woman and the impossibilities we face every day. America Ferrera's monologue was incredible.<br><br>Honestly, I'd recommend this film to anyone and feel like it's crucial that it gets the recognition it deserves. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal director and I can't wait for her next project.",8
" Disappointing
","Had so much more potential. This script was disastrous and felt like what you see in a disappointing sequel. Although Margot Robbie is a perfect cast and she does her job well, it's not enough to carry this movie alone. Ryan Gosling was the bright positive and main source of entertainment, especially during the first half of the film. Not the worst movie of the year but not the best of it's release week either.<br><br>Overall feeling is Gerwig tried a little too hard with the story and ended up missing the point. I am still left with questions of objectives by certain story arcs. Ultimately they tried to be a little too deep, muddying the water and losing the crowd along the way.",5
" Why would a grown adult watch a movie about a plastic doll?
","Wife forced me to see it with her. I had my doubts naturally, and really, a plastic toy movie for girls? I wouldnt watch He man either. I came in with very low expectations and came out thinking this was the best movie of the year thus far(havent seen Oppenheimer yet).<br><br>Just a fantastic fun movie with a great soundtrack and honestly great moral story. This is dispite thinking what the Kens did to the Barbies was completely fair and not unprovoced with the end game of the movie being a bit puzzling as everything went back to the same as before with no lesson learned?<br><br>I have 27 characters left to fill..<br><br>Great movie though, worth a watch.",8
" It isn't for everyone, but it is for me.
","It definitely lived up to my expectations. Walking into the theater I was scared. Considering all the amazing marketing and promotion for this movie, it could've been easily disappointing, but it wasn't for me. The acting was amazing, the jokes and dialogue were funny, but most importantly, it had a message and they stick to it throughout the movie. I don't think the world is ready for a film centered around women, maybe it's too soon. I think some men will wrongly assume that it is an ""anti-men"" movie and they will hate it for it. It's far from that. My hope is that, with time, people will understand its message and realize that we're all Kenough.",9
" My Expectations Were Incredibly High...
","...and the Barbie movie managed to exceed them. I haven't been this excited to see a movie in a very long time, and after going to see it twice in the theater, I still can't stop thinking about it. The writing was phenomenal, the acting was solid, the sets were fun, and the story was lovely. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me call my mom and invite her to go see it together. It takes a lot for a movie to be able to deliver an important message, be entertaining to many generations of movie watchers, and even make you want to go see it again. I believe everyone involved in the creation of this movie knocked it out of the park!",10
