","Everyone knows this is yet another dud by dc by now. But after hearing some positive buzz i thought i'd give it a chance. But nope. Its just another superhero movie.<br><br>What it really is is just Ironman meets Spiderman. No one really cares about this character so they would have had to do something special to make the movie great. But they haven't. Cobra Kai's Xolo Maridueña is likeable enough as the hero. But everyone in this (except Susan Sarandon) is the hero. Either that or they're an annoying ""comedy"" sidekick.<br><br>At least the action starts overshadowing the lame jokes at the half way mark. As before that its just the character getting thrown around as he discovers his powers. But even later its just robots fighting. This is something we've seen a hundred times at this point. But at least the hero doesn't fight Susan Sarandon in the finale.<br><br>So i guess it could have been worse. Its not completely awful.

" Operation Cloneland
","What you get are some okay action sequences and okay special effects. That's more or less the core of Blue Beetle. The story is one straight out of generic-not-so-wonderland, lacking any creativity and any juice (in my opinion, simply embedding a pretty standard story in another cultural context is not the work of a creative titan). At most, this flick will engage three or four of your brain cells. Moreover, most of the fun and comedy elements don't work too well either. These days, writers, directors, and producers seem to think that they can get away with anything because of the work of the special effects department - good storytelling seems an art mostly lost these days. Blue Beetle tastes like one of those chewing gums that have long lost all flavor. Unfortunately, there is no power of cheese to save this one with some decent high-octane schlock. My exact rate: 3.5.",3

Off course there are happy positive resilient people in those communities but taking every stereotype and put it all at once in a family and making them look like the jesters is really annoying. This wasn't a fun movie, it's forgettable, it's the same old story again, it's meek, it has no villain , it's meh...
I wish superhero's could be treated more seriously than what they are getting this days. If you looked to South Korean show ""Moving"" you could learn a thing or two but no: the american paternalistic media society will only take that show and do a remake just because in their deranged conceptions Americans can't read and a foreign language is too annoying and capable of brain damage or creating communists or democrats as they call it there(Lol). Anyway, having a Batman (after Nolan) isn't enough. DC is way more childish and the CGI is always the worst but Marvel movies ,although better like their comics always were, are getting seriously damaged by the idea every hero needs to be Deadpool or Spider-Man copycats.<br><br>Once again ,DC has shot itself in the foot, wait...it blew both feet with a single shot.",1

" A protagonist who doesn't drive the plot
","Let's get the positives out of the way first. The musical score is pretty good, although not up to the normal DC standards for music. There are a couple of cool action moments. Half of the comedic attempts made me laugh. And I loved the intro artwork/music, it got me excited.<br><br>The bad... sigh. Blue Beetle is fairly boring and had difficulty getting me invested. The majority feels generic with nearly everything having been seen in other superhero movies. The one it seemed to copy the most is Shang-Chi. Numerous aspects are nearly identical. Like the zany sister who never stops talking and gets him into trouble. It's the same character that Awkwafina plays. They even steal jokes from it. I knew the joke was coming because I had already seen it in Shang-Chi.<br><br>But the biggest problem with this movie is that the protagonist doesn't drive the plot. Things happen TO him, not BECAUSE of him. And he is saved by something or someone an absurd number of times. It becomes laughable and makes it difficult to root for him.<br><br>To make it worse, we have the stock-est of all stock villains. She's played by veteran actress Susan Sarandon. Not only was this a terrible casting choice, she gives an atrocious performance. Her line delivery is cringe. It doesn't help that the dialogue is terrible.<br><br>I mentioned that half the comedic attempts made me laugh. The other half are awful. They were either cheesy or fully predictable. I knew exactly what would happen or what the punch line would be.<br><br>This movie is also extremely dumb. It's mostly small stuff that can be ignored if it happens once or twice. But it happens 100 times, no exaggeration. I'll give an example. The enemy starts shooting at his friends. Rather than stopping the enemy who is right next to him, he turns around and runs towards his friends. Why? To yell, ""you guys need to get out of here."" It's just bad writing.<br><br>I have no allegiance to DC or Marvel, but I truly feel sad for the die-hard DC fans.

Anyways, the plot of the movie is bland and overdone, maybe if it came out in 2015 it might have been rather enjoyable since they hype was there, although I highly doubt it since the dialogue literally made me gag throughout the entire movie.<br><br>I can't say I'm disappointed in this movies flop, but I'm not surprised either.

" Awful dialog full of bad exposition and a paper thin plot
","The dialog in the very first scene was so bad that I couldn't help but laugh out loud. I hoped it would get better, but it didn't. Every line Susan Sarandon's character says is some of the worst written dialog, and not even her acting chops could salvage it. But it's not just her character, the entire movie is full of terrible exposition presented in what seems like the laziest manner possible.<br><br>The plot is paper thin, too. The only thing the main character wants is money to save his parent's home. Everything that happens to him is caused by happenstance, serendipity, or a ridiculously hard to believe contrivance. I was given no reason to root for any of these characters.<br><br>I did like how they tried to develop the family dynamic, and I was hoping I could rally around that, but even that was clunky, at best. I had the urge to walk out from the very opening scene, but I forced myself to stay for nearly an hour. Eventually, the urge became too strong and I could no longer overcome it, and left the theater about halfway through.<br><br>I'll give this a 3/10 because the actors were trying their best with what they were given, and it really showed in their performances. I especially enjoyed George Lopez's performance, but it wasn't enough to save this film. I also thought the CGI was pretty good (except for the shot looking up inside the Kord building, that shot looked rough).",3
" What Could Have Been.
","Blue Beetle isn't one of the well known DC characters. My only experience with him was from the Young Justice cartoons, which was positive. Blue Beetle is another DC superhero movie failure. A Latino superhero movie that was predictable, had uninspiring characters, a weak, boring villain, and a movie that played too much on Latino stereotypes. This could have been an inspiring Latino superhero movie that many could have related to and enjoyed instead it became a jumbled, boring, amateurish mess. No, even Nana couldn't save this mess of movie. The sad part is that the 2 leads seem to have amazing chemistry together based on their rounds of promotions. But have none in the actual movie. And based on the quality of the movie, it should have been direct to Max not worthy of a theatrical release. How many poorly made DC/WB movies can be made? All I can say is a wise man once said, ""That the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result."" Can James Gunn save the DC universe? Stay tuned!",3
" More mediocore, cliche, trying too hard, MCU-mimicking nonesense
","ORIGIN: I am writing this as I watch the movie. So far the first 40 minutes are basically the combination of Spiderman(Iron Spider cant control suit), Ironman(the suit mimics Ironman in looks, function and design) and Venom(alien symbiote attempting to work with human host) origin stories. There is nothing new, fresh or interesting here. It has all been done before, only better.<br><br>FOCUS: I like the family focus here. However, George Lopez is exhausting and cringe throughout. Kind of like Thor Love and Thunder dragging out the screaming goats joke; that is George Lopez in this movie. Very forced. Otherwise, the family focus works.<br><br>DESIGN: The Blue Beetle suit and design is probably the highlight and coolest part of the movie. Though, its nothing too different than what we have seen Ironman, Spiderman or Venom do.<br><br>VILLAIN/PLOT: Extremely weak, predictable, cliché and underwhelming. We all knew exactly where everything was going.<br><br>XOLO MARIDUENA: I was really rooting for him. And he wasn't bad. But his acting skills don't always work. Maybe give him some more time to develop before handing him such a large role?<br><br>TONE: Like the trend of recent superhero movies. The tone is Chaos. Think more chaos=better movie. Only when done correctly.<br><br>VISUALS: Better than The Flash but that's not saying much.<br><br>Overall, this is just more of the same. Look at Shazam 2, Thor Love and Thunder, Flash, Antman 3. The trend of new superhero movies are trying too hard, cringe, not doing anything fresh and overall very average movies.<br><br>As a side note. DC is dying, sadly. What is this, 7 flops in a row?

I can't even fathom how the Mexican actors in there are okay with the simplistic, absurd, and ridiculous portrait of a family of immigrants depicted in this film. Xolo Maridueña's range of acting is clearly short. Are there really no better Mexican-descent actors in Hollywood? Disappointing. Having Susan Sarandon is not enough to save this disgrace of a film - her character is hollow and exaggerated. It's no surprise why DC's films performances are so low (in both the ticket office and quality) compared to those of Marvel. The love interest is predictable and forced.

This is simply not the kind of film one should take seriously. The humor is hit and miss, thankfully the emotions work well. The Latino superhero does leave a lasting impression.

I can see why it went through development hell for years and I believe it should've remained so.<br><br>The script felt like it was made for Nickelodeon but somehow managed to find its way to Warner Bros and don't get me started on the action scenes.<br><br>What a joke.<br><br>In all, Blue Beetle was set to flop from the beginning - From the cast to the scriptwriting to the obvious CGI, it stood no chance.<br><br>I'd not recommend this unless you've got time to burn.",1
" I'm tired of superheroes, but this is a big surprise
","One of the biggest surprises of the year. It's also one of the funniest superhero movies ever with a very distinctive identity.<br><br>There are some typical exposition dumps for the genre, and the emotional moments don't always hit the mark with a familiar structure, but it's a film with a huge heart, incredibly good humor, and excellent characters. All the ""good side"" characters are very well crafted and distinct, each of them having moments to shine.<br><br>In technical terms, it has some surprises and tricks up its sleeve, with good editing, well-choreographed and entertaining fast-paced action, and a strong score and soundtrack. What's even better is the way it incorporates Latin culture to show us the true sense of community and family, elevating the film's message and contributing to most of the arcs.<br><br>All the performances are outstanding. Madridueña has what it takes to be the star of this film and all of them deserve praises, but the best is the crazy uncle portrayed by George Lopez. Good movie even if you are tired of superhero movies.",8

No, not numerus, too many to count!<br><br>Logic holes are expected in a ""super hero"" movie. I am not talking about logic holes but about plot holes. Can't explain more without making a spoiler.<br><br>Special effects? Perfect.<br><br>Acting? No problem.<br><br>Direction? ...Oh boy!

" Power Rangers on the CW network
","Blue Beetle is featured well in one of the Batman cartoons i think in the Brave and the Bold. In that he is a fun teenager trying to figure out his powers and how to help Bats. If you want to see a good representation of Blue Beetle i recommend finding this animated series. This movie kind of felt like Power Rangers on the CW network, albeit with a much higher budget. There was nothing to care about here. I think DC was stretching to find more characters to bring to big screen. He is a supporting character at best. It is a good comparison to Shazam 2 with all the focus on secondary characters. Both are a waste of money and a little on time. If you have nothing else to watch its ok.",2
" BatMan the Fascist.
",Yup that's how I knew the cringe movie was going to be as bad as it looked. This movie is just filled with cringe cliche stuff that they believe the Latino family is into. Blue Beatle needs his family to fight all his battles for him that's not surprising when you one these New Gen kids can't do anything without mommy and daddy holding thier hands and that's what this is all about. I was hoping this movie would do good too! Nope they had to ruin it with bad stereotypes. I guess that's fine stereotype it up man but BatMan is the Fascist.. I was wondering if they would take that out of the film cause they removed it from the trailers but nope they kept it in. They want to try a kill one of DCs best characters ever for a side character.. Go watch it if you love cringe cliches then this is the film for you.,1
" Too much is too much
","Doesn't mean the director is Mexican she is needed for the job. The director has just made 1 movie and that's it! What is DC thinking???<br><br>All about the family but really unnecessary! Aiding him to battle is a no no! Especially that grandma oh my goodness! Plus having Ted's daughter introduced when she is non-existent in the comics is a bad move too. They should rather have Ted instead to mentor Jaime. And maybe, just maybe we get to see a Blue &amp; Gold movie which will suck coz Gunn is running the show.<br><br>Khaji-da is not a female TF! Also, that scarab at his back is waaaaay to BIG! Don't get me started on OMAC! Isn't he a hero? And got his powers from Brother Eye made by Bruce Wayne? And he's a cyborg too not a human transforming into a war machine!<br><br>It was an ok movie. It does not deserve a higher ranking above 6. Maybe a flat 6. Or 5!",3
" Another appointed loser!
","There seems to be alot of these such movies lately where something incredible is chosen for someone to be great and the so called chosen recipient of the gift or blessing is so non deserving with highly irritating low self esteem that one starts to cheer for the bad guys instead to end the audiences' suffering. What happened to real super heroes like John Wick or Jack Ryan where they wear their battle amour with responsible conviction and honourable mission to do good without a second thought. This show comes off the lot to fill the ethnic diversity quota in Hollywood of recent push. Yes, by all means, but for goodness sake, arm such protagonist with more oomph and self pride and courage. All needs a dash of Bruce Lee to make this porridge perfect for all future Goldilocks.",5
" A DC FILM THAT JUST WANTS TO BE FUN
","DCEU's 2023 has been at a dipping point. With the disappointment of Shazam! Fury of the Gods, in which the first one I really loved, and the somewhat decent of a Flash movie, it seems like the way the franchise is ending doesn't seem like a bang. Fortunately, Blue Beetle has already come out oh boy did it not disappoint.<br><br>Now let me preface this: it is by no means a classic nor is it groundbreaking in the superhero genre. At the end of the day, I just want to have a good time in the theaters and, for the most part, it succeeds in what I'm aiming for: a fun time.<br><br>Xolo Maridueña as the titular young Iron Man-like superhero, alter-ego Jaime Reyes, was really good. He brings a lot of energy to his performance filled with charisma, awkwardness and relatability because of his love for his family.<br><br>Speaking of family, everyone was really good playing in their respective roles but George Lopez was easily the standout because of how funny his lines and reactions are towards Jaime.<br><br>And the theme of the family is really at the center of Blue Beetle, it's really hard not to ignore it which is similar to Shazam. But as the film moves on, it does feel like everything that was done to make this possible was filled with heart by the filmmakers and knew just to be simply entertaining, hitting at all the right beats to make you laugh and cry.<br><br>The pacing was surprisingly good as to how they were able to fill in the runtime which doesn't make it feel like two hours at all as you are watching it. It's like it took two to three days in the story, if you look at the second to the third act. That was really impressive.<br><br>Visuals are great and the action sequences are really good to look at. Props to the director of photography, who by the way did Hereditary and Midsommar - yeah, let that sink in.<br><br>Of course, the film is not without its faults. It is cheesy at times, does feel generic and doesn't seem like it wants to outshine the rest of the films not just in DC but everything superhero in general. But my personal issue would have to be how they handled Susan Sarandoncs character and the nemesis of Jaime. While I get where they are going, it felt like it needed to be more compelling and not just some cartoony villains.<br><br>But by the end, I walked out of Blue Beetle thinking how good it was to see an enjoyable film with the message of family that hit me emotionally. Would I recommend the movie? Yes.",6

Much, much screaming.<br><br>Screaming while fighting, screaming that he does not want to fight, screaming family, this movie should have been called ""The Screamers""...<br><br>And I don't even get to the many non sense, like Blue Beetle doesn't want to kill.

" So this is Gunns DCU? Meh
","Here we are the first movie in Gunns supposed Reboot and DCU and in fine fashion just like his The Suicide Squad Movie its flopping and sinking faster than the titanic.<br><br>I tried to give this movie a shot I really did but its terrible and generic to the point they even tried to play the ethnic card and it has completely fallen flat on its face.<br><br>On the good side atleast the special fx were an improvement.....atleast compared to the flash but come on the DC property since 2017 from its managment and choices has been low par.<br><br>The movies since 2017 Josstice League onwards have floundered and completely imploded, but hey thats what happens when a studio decided to listen to critics and haters and then started making the movies for those types of people, you get a mess, you get flops, you get mediocre, you get generic and pointless movies.<br><br>I have no interest in Gunns DCU because if its anything like this then it is over before its started, think I will download his movies because I sure aint going to pay to see them after how the studio treated the actors, directors and its fans for almost a decade.<br><br>James Gunn good luck with Superman Legacy because even that sounds like another retread of the flop Superman Returns 2006 all over again, gunn your going to very much and seriously need it.",4
" Not worth watching
","Let's start by just saying granny with a neon automatic gun. That says it all, 600 characters not needed. 4DX was pretty bad too. Bumps and shakes that just didn't make sense. Like a thud in the back when the door got kicked. Really, 4DX is trying to put me in the shoes of the door. Although as the characters were all wooden too, it probably wouldn't make much difference. I literally didn't care about any of the characters. They could have lived, or died and I wouldn't be bothered. Personalityless shells. Really silly film but also not funny, just lame. Usual poor Hollywood dialogue and unmemorable performances, with no story other than good guy has thing bad guy wants, bad guy chases good guy.",2
" Dull, wooden and witless
","You've seen one, you've seen them all. Blue Beetle is about as cookie-cutter as the bombastic superhero mcmovie genre comes. This generic mishmash of the well and truly worn-out superhero template differs only in that it desperately tries to pander to demographic stereotypes and messaging. The origin story needs no description, you've already seen it a hundred times over in various films, tv shows or comics. Sarandon's mailed in performance as the villain was dull, wooden, and witless. As always, George Lopez played George Lopez as well as he knows how - with the voice of a badger and the personality of a telemarketer calling you on your personal cell at 9 o'clock at night. Some will say it's superhero fatigue. For myself, it's dumpster fire exhaustion. We need to get back to making great films for everyone. Great writing, acting and directing will always have universal appeal. Blue Beetle proves yet again that the Hollywood sludge factory is entirely incapable of providing it.",2
" Bang Average
","Blue Beetle has the unique angle of bringing a Latin superhero character to the screen in a leading role for the first time, but outside of that nothing about this film is unique or original.<br><br>The story is a formulaic superhero origin story. It's fine and it does the job but isn't particularly inspiring or overly engaging. There's an attempt to inject some emotion into the piece but it feels a little half-hearted. Susan Sarandon feels under-developed as a villain which makes the stakes feel quite low.<br><br>For the most part the action is pretty bland. The final set piece is a CG blur that is a bit of a snooze and considering the skill set of Blue Beetle the action could have been a lot better.<br><br>Despite all this, the performance from Xolo Mariduena is strong and he creates a likeable and engaging character, as do all his family members. There's some good humour throughout, and the film does look quite good in parts, with some decent enough direction.<br><br>Overall, this film is a perfectly average superhero film. It's formulaic and uninspired, but it is a fun enough watch.",6
" Disappointment
","This movie was an absolute disappointing pile of crap. Hollyweird at its finest shoving PC garbage down our throats. The plot is so simular to all other super hero films. It drags allt, the comedy is just plain and simple BLAH. George Lopez is just not funny. If this is part of Gunn's new DC reboot, then his other reboots will probably fail. The worst start to a reboot group of films. My wife, who is a native Spanish speaker thought this film was really really bad. I hope to hell there isn't a sequel. I don't have a problem with the actor choices, but even the dialog and acting was really bad.",3
" they can't find a better writer
","The Blue Beetle is a generic action film that fails to stand out from the countless other movies in the genre. The plot is shallow and predictable, with a shallow robotic villain (a blue beetle) for a villain and a generic hero as our protagonist. The CGI and fight scenes are passable, but nothing memorable. The acting is decent, but the dialogue is nothing special. All in all, this is a generic action movie that is watchable, but nothing special. It won't win any awards, but it will provide a bit of entertainment if you're a fan of the genre.<br><br>Blue Beetle was an awful, generic movie. The acting was wooden, the story was predictable, and the characters completely lacked depth. None of the actors made an effort to make their character believable, and the script was so cliché it could have been written by a child. Moreover, the special effects were so outdated they looked like something out of an old TV show, not a movie. Even the soundtrack was generic and stale. In all, Blue Beetle was a waste of time, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1

" I'm Mexican, and I'm still disapointed.
","I REALLY wanted to like this movie, despite hearing a lot of people say it's mid or bad, and constantly hearing it's gunna bomb at the box office. Despite hearing all that constantly, I still tried to go in with a clear open-mind, and I was still disappointed.<br><br>It's been said a million times before because it's true, but this is an EXTREMELY cliched super hero origin movie. The super cliched plot wouldn't be as bad if the characters and humor hit better, but that sadly isn't the case either.<br><br>The humor for me just didn't hit whatsoever for me like 90percent of the time. Some of the humor is SUPER corny, and I generally don't mind corny humor, but the corny humor in this movie just takes it to a WHOLE Nother LEVEL! There's good corny and there's bad corny, this is bad corny, which doesn't even bring a little smirk on my face. The suspension of disbelief they pull just for a cheap unfunny joke is lowkey insulting.<br><br>Xolo Mariduena is the best part of the movie, He's my second favorite character on Cobra Kai, the first being William Zabka. It's too bad Xolo was given a bad movie to work with, he's very charismatic and see great acting potential in him, but he just isn't given enough material to show that with this movie, could've made him funnier or at least give him a real arc. Jamie Reyes/Blue Beetle doesn't even have a real character arc. I guess his arc is he loves his family, then by the end, he still loves his family? Huh? I guess he has this super random thing that he's against killing, but I thought that was so dumb and unnecessary to include in the movie. Obviously killing innocent people is wrong, but killing people who are trying to kill innocent people isn't that bad. Plus after his anti-killing scene, it's barely ever mentioned again and this message really goes nowhere, so why was it ever mentioned in the first place? The movie would've been better if the ""no killing thing"" was just never bought up. And the no-killing thing just makes Xolo look like an idiot. The ""no killing"" message made sense in a movie like Terminator 2 for example because it's a huge part of the overall narrative of the movie, but here, it doesn't really do anything, so why is it here?<br><br>The two main villains are super cliche,"" Your family is what makes you weak!"" Give me a break, seems like this movie was made for 10-year-olds. It's just SO BASIC and cliche that it's corny. Susan Sarandon completely phones in her role too, but I don't blame her because she is given nothing to work with. We all know Susan Saradon is a seasoned actor and clearly knows how to act, so she obviously chose not to even try in this movie, because she knows there is nothing to work with.<br><br>The ""girlfriend"" is probably the worst actor in the movie. I supposed she's supposed to be the ""love interest?"" But huge quotations on that because she's really bland and has zero chemistry with Xolo. She's more like an AI exposition dump, and that's it.<br><br>The action was overall just decent. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's barely just good either. It could've been way better, and Xolo barely used any cool stuff with the powers he has. This is not a spoiler because it's in the trailer, but he makes a Final Fantasy sword, this was kinda cool, but it seems random in the context of the movie. It would've been cooler and made more sense if the movie showed he was a big gamer or Final Fantasy fan earlier in the movie, and could've used other video-game weapons. And would've been kinda a cool, unique, and relatable thing for a young adult to do. But this movie only shows Mexicans liking stereotypical Mexican stuff, can't be more unique and show Mexicans liking other things like Final Fantasy, anime, or video-games in general.<br><br>I'm just sad because we don't get a lot of Mexican superheroes, so they should've put way more effort into this movie if they wanted it to be successful, but they didn't. The lack of quality in the movie shows it. You just can't be super pro-diversity, then when finally get a chance to make a big-budget Hispanic movie, you made a below-mediocre mess of a movie. Whoever wrote and directed this movie just ruined it for more diversity movies in the future. And I know the writer and director of this movie are both Hispanic, so I don't get why didn't they try harder??!?!!?! They should've tried harder or the main studio should've hired writers and directors with more talent and/or cared more.<br><br>I just wiki'd who directed and wrote this movie, and the director only has 2 movies before this I never heard of. They should've hired a way more experienced director. As for the writer, he DOESN'T even have a wiki page!!! WOW! So your telling me the studios hired some guy to write this movie has no prior movie writing experience or even show writing experience in his whole life?!?!?! Why was he hired?!?!? No wonder the writing is so bad, and I know there can still be studio inference as well, but we still deserved at least a competent writer for this movie.<br><br>This was my last hope for the DC cuz 90percent of their movies are awful, and they recently keep just making flop after flop and it's easy to see why. It BLOWS MY MIND how one of the richest studios struggles to make a single good movie when they have WAY MORE resources than 90% of other movie companies. They can't even decide if this movie is part of the rebooted DCU or not. How about this, you'd never have to worry about rebooting your series in the first place if you just consistently made good movies like youre supposed to! Making good movies should ALWAYS be at the top of your list.",4
" Better than you think!
","The marketing is letting this movie down! This film is so much more than just a origin story for a new superhero! This film has a lot of heart, with the directors love and care for this character being evident throughout the film!

Also, so many touchy and difficult societal issues are brought up and tackled in respectful and nuanced ways. Their inclusion doesn't pull you out of the movie whatsoever! You aren't hit over the head with anything and these issues actually end up aiding the story and character greatly and give the film that much more of an emotional punch!<br><br>The acting was phanominal as well!

" DC's Spanish Spider-Man feels like a 90's made for tv power rangers film
",Another day and another superhero film graces the big screen. This time it's DC with a film that feels like a cheap spider-man rip off without any of the interesting bits.<br><br>Xolo Mariduena plays a young Mexican guy who's just returning home to his family after becoming the first of his family to graduate from college. Like many of us he finds himself jobless and it debt and now the pressures on as the rent for the family home is about to be tripled. What follows is a story about how a guy who's down on his luck mistakenly unleashes the power of the blue beetle and as we all know with great power comes great responsibility which is a quote that maybe Hollywood execs need to start putting into practice with how they treat their writers.<br><br>The film is about as formulaic as it could be with every single Mexican stereotype forced in there often in the form of jokes that rarely land. I appreciate seeing diversity in my films but Mexican please let me know are you happy with how you're being represented because I wouldn't be if I were you?<br><br>The films tone doesn't even feel like that of a DC film it's strangely light hearted to the point where it at times feels like a parody of a superhero film. This becomes an even bigger issue when the film throws in some emotional scenes as they have no affect on an audience as they feel so out of place with the light hearted nature of the rest of the film.<br><br>I tried to stick with this one for as long as I could and there was a scene in the middle between the main character and his uncle (who by the way is by far the best character) where I felt the film may be about to pick up. This wasn't however the case and for the last 45 minutes I found myself on my phone and I can't say I've been this bored with a film since Ant Man Quantumania. Whilst I know this film isn't apart of the new phase of DC I do worry what may happen to the state of their productions in the hands of James Gunn who has publicly defended this film.<br><br>For me it's the worst film of the year so far.,3
" Expected more but still enjoyed it
","I remember loving blue beetle in cartoons growing up so I was excited for this. I feel like people, generally speaking, aren't as hyped up for this. I enjoyed it but it was a mixed bag, there's nothing really adventurous attempted and for the most part, just felt good or okay enough. Too many things could've been done better.<br><br>The family's dynamic was fine, yet the emotional connection between Jaime and Jenny was notably nonexistent- their attempt to forge it even prompted some to audibly scream no in the theatre. The actors' portrayal felt unconvincing, and the writing felt contrived, unimaginatively executed too. The familial bond is likely to resonate with fans later in the future, as evident in their concerted effort to show Blue Beetle is a family guy, along with the Perez family ethos. They really wanted to push that narrative and hammer it home. While I do know that in my brain, but I also wanted to feel that in my heart. James Gunn is a master at this, adept at bridging the gap between what I know and what I feel about a group of characters. They had too many family talks in my opinion, tried too hard. As for Blue Beetle himself, he's a character we'll love more the more we see him(I think), making his debut a respectable foundation for the future DC Universe. However, the ongoing controversy between DCU/DCEU and James Gunn's new vision might contribute to a diverse range of reviews.<br><br>Pretty good comedic timing and the jokes didn't feel contrived. The suit had a cool design, and despite not having watched Blue Beetle cartoons in over a decade, it had familiarity. The transformation into Blue Beetle was strikingly done with a hint of horror, which I found compelling. I appreciated the mix of cartoonish yet realistic action sequences. There were still some 'fast and furious' ludicrous level action scenes.<br><br>Some animations looked like video games with their 3D-like quality, and a few scenes lacked the grandeur suited for IMAX screens. The density of the visuals didn't match up, perhaps I'm influenced by the standards set by ""Oppenheimer,"" which was what I saw last in IMAX. Initially planned to watch in standard 2D, I went for the earliest available viewing instead.<br><br>The story was a generic but it had a lot of interesting stuff in. Beyond the superhero himself, DC's attempt to bring some novelty into the genre was lacking. Some plot reveals didn't have the impact they should've. Improved character background execution, particularly for Nana and the main villain, was needed; their histories felt like it was mentioned only for plot convenience, notably the grandmother's history just because of how it was revealed. Some dialogue and plot towards the end was very predictable.<br><br>Fighting scenes were mostly cool, although apart from the final one, they didn't reach their maximum climactic potential; only the last battle drew me in. The high personal stakes were great, clearly showing what was at risk and effectively following through on those stakes.<br><br>A more serious and slightly darker tone would have heightened the emotional impact of the events in the third act. The movie seemed caught between taking itself very seriously and/or embracing a fun, lighthearted vibe, leaving an uncertain feel. It lacked a distinct impact or identity, floating in a sort of no man's land. If you didn't know Blue Beetle already or indifferent towards him, the film struggled to convincingly make you fall in love with the character or feel a connection. On the positive side, the movie showcased significant Latino representation. In terms of cultural blending, I'd rank Shang-Chi, Black Panther 2, Blue Beetle, Ms. Marvel, and then the first Black Panther.<br><br>The movie excels in certain parts, while its shortcomings aren't overwhelmingly bad, but they could be better. Sadly, seemed to be more of the latter. The quick post-credit scenes were nice, sparing us from what often feels like a long wait usually. Loved that they included the previous versions of blue beetle, it's also quite rare for a superhero film to have a sense of standalone authenticity, rather than just serving as a vehicle to introduce new characters or set up future movies.<br><br>I typically avoid badmouthing actors, but I believe acting could've been better. As previously mentioned, my earlier comment about the love interests still stands. The chemistry between the actors, the portrayal of emotions in their eyes-whether it was excitement, agony, or loss-and the conviction of the main villain didn't resonate with me. The lack of connection and genuine emotion felt like a first draft, and felt like a mid-2000s Disney show. This contributes to the feeling of a medley mixed bag, the dialogue, story, and acting all fell short of being amazing individually. While nothing was too bad, when combined, they accentuated each other, drawing attention to each.<br><br>While far from flawless, I still left with a smile. The story was somewhat straightforward, and considering Blue Beetle's unique, I half-expected the movie to reinvent the wheel, though my hopes weren't too high. There were a lot of elements of a potentially mind blowing fantastic movie, It just doesn't feel like they were pieced together the best that they could've, but definitely still enjoyable. I know it's an origin story but it just feels like DC just played it super safe; and at a time when ""superhero burnout"" is a thing, playing it safe ain't too safe.",7
" One Performance Away from Being An Even Better Movie Than It Already Is
","It became increasingly obvious that Blue Beetle was designed to be a fun family film with maybe the younger members of the family in mind. It's not quite a Spy Kids movie but it's close. A young adult version if you will. Don't get me wrong I love the Spy Kids movies for what they are and this movie made me think of them, but a grown-up version. Blue Beetle has heart, the emotion - I teared up a few times, - and the family dynamic is...great. It's a joyous movie that celebrates Latin culture well, but it falters when it comes to the superhero side of things, mainly the villain's goal and that he's fighting another version of himself.<br><br>The violence and the softened but still gory on-screen deaths would be the things that make this Spy kids-like movie - to keep the previous example - more adult but it's the performances that make it so, except for one. Uncle Rudy was too much, he was in a low-budget Spy Kids movie, while the others weren't. It was so jarring. He was so grating for me that I was tensed whenever he was on screen, which was a lot. It's like he's trying to be the main character in this movie instead of the supporting. Not everything he says or does is cringe but enough to be worrying once the pattern was identified and there's two third of the movie to go. I don't know if it's the casting, the direction, or the script, maybe all three but Uncle Rudy was not it, not the secret sauce. He really brought this movie down for me. This role could have been played differently. He's being a caricature when the others are desperately trying not to be. I'm not hating on him but him being the main thing that doesn't quite work in the movie is pretty good in my book.<br><br>Xolo, Bellissa, and Bruna really shine in this movie as do most of the Reyes family cast, they made me care about the family and what happens. Xolo is a great Jaime, I'm most familiar with the character from Young Justice but I recognized him in Xolo. Belissa as Jaime's sister was amazing, she seamlessly brought the dry humor and the sadness, she didn't lose me once. Bruna is a great find and this is probably the role that I'll recognize her from.<br><br>Blue Beetle is entertaining and fun, a good time at the cinema, yet just shy of being great.<br><br>@garcwrites.",7
" Is He Really A Hero?
","The movie was so annoying with how little the main guy did. He always needed his family who had no abilities to rescue him. And the parts about him constantly fighting it and trying to ""talk it out"" With the bad guy who is beating his face in... like what?<br><br>They tried to make the movie funny but it didn't come off right. There was too much talking and not enough action. Too many main leads, it had me asking who was the main character again. It seemed everyone got the same amount of screen time. The love story had no chemistry it felt out of place. The movie quickly got boring. The lead character had nothing memorable about him. He just felt like an average guy. A Mary Sue. There were no flaws. No grit. Not even funny or charming. And why on earth, if you have nothing at all, wouldn't you want the powers?",5
" toooo much talking and drama
","Very bad acting. Everything is forced. The jokes, the drama the love story. Imagine being sad because she remembered her past and then the boy talks a little then they kiss. So very old style. So not connected. This scenario is very common in low class clubs where there are sad boys or sad girls that gets comforted then gets fkd. Then there is too much shouting in normal conversations like they all want attention.<br><br>The only thing I like is the fighting graphics. But still the hero is very dramatic and stupd in his decisions.<br><br>They wasted the potential of the movie. With their budget a high school student can make it better.",3
" Stupid
","This might have been marginally toleranle in the 1980's, but is a complete waste of time now.<br><br>The family is far too loud, pointlessly obnoxious, and far too stupid. In fact, everyone is just too stupid. Combined IQ of all the characters apoears to be 80.<br><br>Cheezy bad guys, really dumb dialog, uninspired fight scenes. So-so cgi. Just utter drivel. All mportant (and potentially interesting) points ignored entirely or glossed over without follow-up in favor of more obnoxious family stupidity, and more excessive and pointless noise (screaming, yelling, everyone talking at the same time so any conversation is just meaningless noise) Honestly, don't waste your time.",1
" New Age Nonsense
","Very few, except for older diehard Super Hero comics fans actually know who Blue Beetle is. He is not ""the melding of Ironman and Ant Man"" nor is he a smart mouth Gen Z. Blue Bettle is Ted Cord, an industrialist along the lines of Bruce Wayne, more than Tony Stark. He predates DC and was bought by DC from. Charlton Comics. Anyone who goes back to read the originals or his 1980s participation in Justice League will recognize the Watchmen character Owl who was based on Blue Beetle.<br><br>Sadly, the trend in comics today is to present flawed people with powers rather than Heroes a reader can aspire to. This trend is given a nitro-burst in Hollywood where many supers are actually criminals such as Deadpool, Venom, Black Adam, Joker, Ant Man. It is part of the culture that wants to redefine (read obliterate) the notion of Hero under the guise of ""humanizing"" the character. To paraphrase The Incredibles (a truly underrated story), if no one is special, then everyone is.<br><br>So it comes as no surprise that this version of Blue Beetle fails, because it offers nothing to lift the spirit of the viewer, nothing they can take with them as they leave the theater. Bruce Wayne comes out of the theater with his parents, having just seen Zorro, only to have them murdered. He idolizes the HERO he saw in Zorro and dedicates his life to fighting crime so no other child has to lose his parents. He is the Dark Knight who does not kill...until the 1980s when. Tim Burton gets his hands on him and devolves the character.<br><br>You will probably enjoy Blue Beetle as the empty shell, devoid of any human value other than mindless entertainment. Sadly, we could do so much more.",3
" Terrible movie with illogical plot and boring characters
","I wasn't able to finish the movie by watching it seriously so I had to apprehend the plot like it's a comedy. The characters are very naive and boring and no character growth among any characters and worst of all, the ending was very predictable and idealist. The main character seems to be too gentle and didn't want to hurt anyone to a degree that it was upsetting for me to watch. The romance between 2 characters are also very forced. Blue beetle seem to have a lot of humour in the beginning that i initially enjoy but the movie itself rendered all efforts for comedy essentially useless. In short, the movie was a waste of money and time.",1
" Worst movie I've seen in the cinema this year
","I had low expectations of this film.<br><br>I don't ask for much with movies, just for them to be mildly entertaining at minimum and have some heart. All the talk about bad CGI in the likes of The Flash I don't care about so much. I thought that particular movie was fine. Fun, had decent heart and some likeable characters scattered about who are at least trying to do things to move the story forwards.<br><br>Blue Beetle however, is as bad as things can become I think when it comes to superhero movies. We have seen some terrible entries in the Marvel space recently as well with Thor 4, Dr Strange 2 and Black Panther 2 being very poor. Strange story choices, terrible villains and bad resolutions. In all 3 of those films the main super heroes are almost just background characters and no longer the focus.<br><br>Blue Beetle is on that terrible level and this film makes even less sense I have to say and again the main superhero is relegated to be less important than he ought to be for some reason.<br><br>Every character seems so unlikeable, except for the father. The sister talks about taking a big dump at her cleaning job after we first hear how the family struggles financially. Charming. The grandma ends up with a higher kill count than the super hero. The uncle is a computer wizard who drives a big truck but still can't help the family keep their home.<br><br>This whole family, who can't make end's meet but who can do everything else when it suits the story just doesn't work in a superhero film. It is not convincing. Story wise I think it is fine/good if they can be there for support and guidance. But to physically take over I think is a crazy approach that doesn't land well at all, especially when the best person out of that bunch is the one who dies before all that takes off.<br><br>After the father's death the family straight away uses all the abandoned (supposedly) Blue Beetle related gear as in a sort of kitted out ready to go endless Batcave supply. But then we also find out the original Blue Beetle host who that all belong to is still alive in the mid credits scene? Why are we doing any of this? It is all so dumb and never focuses on what the current Blue Beetle superhero could do for humanity.<br><br>Susan Sarandon, as the baddie, phones in her performance to make things worse. An utterly pointless villain who has some vague mission to make her robot army more of a robot army with the Blue Beetle scarab thing.<br><br>Furthermore, early on, we find out that the Blue Beetle suit / scarab that gets fused with our hero's body can actually run on auto pilot. So what is the reason to keep the host conscious in that case? The suit seems to make better decisions early on whilst the host succeeds in convincing it to stop it from killing baddies, who then when still alive cause his father's heart attack and death.<br><br>Compare that badly thought out drivel to the excellent story in the original Superman movie where Superman can't save his father from a heart attack death. He has all these powers but couldn't do that. Reality sinks in and it makes him more determined. There is no such character arc here at all.<br><br>I didn't like any of what was presented in Blue Beetle story wise or character wise. There isn't 1 thing I can tell you I liked.<br><br>There have been far better small budget movies this year that should have enjoyed more popularity over this endless superhero nonsense in which we constantly have to put up with lower quality story telling and horrible characters. Some good films I saw recently this year that may have gone unnoticed are: Talk to Me &amp; Sisu. If you're after a big movie go see Gran Turismo.<br><br>Look for those and give this tripe a miss.<br><br>It has not been a bad year for movies I think and this hopefully is as low as it can go cinema wise.",4
" A Great Sci-Fi Film, With A Great Tone And Some Pretty Fun Comedic Scenes And Characters
","I really love the film Blue Beetle! One thing I enjoy is the strong cultural theme at its center. It is a great sci-fi film, with a great tone and some pretty fun comedic scenes and characters, which is different for a DC movie.<br><br>The storyline is set in Palmera City where Jamie Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a Gotham pre-law graduate, is trying to get a job. When he meets Jenny Kord (Bruna Marqueszine), she gives him a piece of alien technology called the ""Scarab"" that gives him superpowers. The plot thickens when a woman named Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) tries to steal the Scarab back from Jamie, putting his entire family in danger.<br><br>The storyline is great. What this story does differently than other superhero movies is make the main character's family a big part of the action. There are a lot of other unique things about this film, too. I love the way the director and writers bring representation of Latino culture into the film through the characters and the sets. Palmera City, Jamie's house and Jamie's family all feel very realistic. The costumes are incredible as well, especially the Blue Beetle suit-it's slick and has a personality of its own. Of all the characters, my favorite is Rudy (George Lopez), who brings a lot of fun into his scenes. He is the 'tech support' for Jamie, but is also a conspiracy theorist, and there are a lot of jokes based on his quirky personality. The makeup effects are great too; for example the scene where Jamie transforms into the Blue Beetle.<br><br>The film's message is that family makes you stronger, not weaker, which is a theme I love. Be forewarned that the film has a few violent scenes, a lot of action, some profanity and sexual references.<br><br>I give Blue Beetle 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases in theaters on August 18, 2023. By Connor S., KIDS FIRST!",10
" Dull, boring and derivative
","Dull, boring and derivative. In short, Blue Beetle sucks. While it's great to have the world's first Hispanic super-hero, it's a shame it has to arrive via this s#!t film.<br><br>From charmless characters to a convoluted storyline, the whole film just drags.<br><br>The lead actor - Xolo - is completely uninspiring. Bruna completely lacks a personality. The sister comes across as a complete jerk. The others have the standard Hollywood superhero nothingness, just one dimensional fillers. Presumably they thought that the heavy emphasis on family etc would fill in the gaps, but yeah nah. Didn't at all.<br><br>The director tries to infuse lots of synth music, but the film never pulls it off right. The plot is both standard and completely sucks. There's nothing new here, folks.<br><br>Superhero movies saturate the cinemas, and while Marvel has a good run, the DCEU is trying to get started a decade too late. James Gunn might make okay movies, but I doubt he's up to the challenge that rebooting the DCEU will take.<br><br>Skip it. You won't regret it.",4
" Blue rubbish
","Another DC failure. Thought I was hoodwinked into believing it was for adults when really the audience aimed at were 10-12 years of age. Childish, utterly child-like in its storyline.<br><br>Stereo-typed Mexicans made out to be annoying and stupid. Maybe while the US doesn't want them to be citizens if we go by this story. And having a 70+ years grannie wielding a modern sub-machine gun is old fashioned and cartoonish. Nothing new, original or funny in the movie.<br><br>There are way too many 'cartoon-hero' movies being released today and eventually they begin to repeat storylines and themes, as is the case here. Watch if you're a sci-fi addict. Bored with nothing else to do or forced to view, but can't see any real reason why anyone would want to waste 2 hours watching Blue Beetle.",1
" Welcome new DCU!
","SCORE: 9.3/10<br><br>I would say DC is back, but it's been back. What I will say is welcome new DCU! Blue Beetle certainly won't be looked back at like Iron Man is in the MCU, but this was a pretty damn good start for the new DCU. Yes, I know he's technically just the first character in the DCU and the ""first DCU movie"" will be Superman, but you know what I mean. DC is in great hands, no matter what the Zack Snyder Twitter Simps will tell you. There is so much to like about Blue Beetle. Apart from having to deal with a complete weirdo sitting next to me, I had such a fun time watching this movie develop. I was fully expecting this to be a trailer movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality plot points added to what we got with the trailer. George Lopez had me worried that it was going to be stupid funny, but it ended up actually just being funny funny. His character was a massive highlight for this film, and the theme of family was surprisingly strong. It was basically Spider-Man meets Ant-Man meets Iron Man meets Shang-Chi meets Ms. Marvel, with its own flavor as well. It was action packed and extremely entertaining from start to finish.<br><br>All I could think the entire time I was watching the movie was how much more likable of a person Xolo Maridueña is than Ezra Miller. I love his energy and he seems like a genuinely good soul, with the acting talent to back it up. I am so happy he was chosen to play Blue Beetle, and I'm super excited to see what they do with his character moving forward. His chemistry with Bruna Marquezine made her character so much more likable, and they are two beautiful looking human beings. I love what they did with the connection of Jamie to his father. That moment they share when he is getting his powers back was very powerful. Also, does DC know how to do character design or what? Their villain design has always been top tier, but their skill to craft a hero and villain that mesh so well together like Jamie and Carapax do was impressive. Their battles were colorful and visually stunning to watch. Would've liked to see some foreshadowing for future DCU projects in the post credit scenes, but completely understand that it's still too early on.<br><br>The concept of Blue Beetle is awesome. I wasn't a massive fan of how long it took for him to embrace his powers, but I was kept entertained while it was happening by how funny it was. Now that he has fully embraced his powers and his role moving forward, we now get to explore the idea of having a superhero who wears armor that literally protects him from dying, heals him from any wound, and can generate any weapon that he imagines. Not only that, but it sounds like Jenny's father will be coming back, who was the original Blue Beetle. Of all the new superheroes they could've made movies about, I'm glad they chose something as cool as Blue Beetle. As always, people are going to complain and complain and complain, especially since it will be DC ""fans"", but I absolutely loved this kick off to the DCU. Also, María la del Barrio??? I used to watch that all the time growing up when we were in Spanish class. Honestly a top 2 Telenovela of all time, and it's not 2.",9

" What could have been a really cool superhero film ruined by terrible writing.
","Anyone who follows DC or even comics as a whole, knows how promising of a character Blue Beetle is in the comics-verse. Guy has been a featuring member of Teen Titans for decades, holding his own as one of the coolest drawn characters that has a very interesting backstory regarding an alien symbiote. The character had immense potential to be turned into a promising live-action film-series out of it. And frankly speaking, I think the cast choice was good as well - they could've pulled off the hype. The only thing that ruined this film, however, is the writing. It's terrible - felt so rushed and low-depth at some points that you'd feel like pausing to not continue watching anymore. CGI was bad for some parts too, but that can still be overlooked as most of it gets the job done quite well. But the writing, man, it's awful. DCU won't have much to build on if they continue doing such pathetic job at writing stories like this.",6
" NANNA THE GOAT
","So Blue Beetle is definitely fun, I'm not sure if it's as amazing as people are making it out to be but it's a fun movie and a solid introduction.<br><br>The story is about Jaime ( Hi May ) who comes in contact with the Scarab and turns him into the Blue Beetle. His family are under threat as Cord Industries want the Scarab back, He must become one with the Blue Beetle and fight for his family and his freedom.<br><br>The family element is really good, usually they say it's family oriented and there a joke or 2 but family is at the heart of the movie and the stand outs for me is NANNA the goat, a caring figure and a bada$$, the uncle is also great, he has some funny likes but his overall character works.<br><br>Blue Beetle himself is really enjoyable, the movie is fine to be honest it's an origin story. Not man of those are AMAZING but his personality and likeness pulls the movie. Good action scenes and I love the suit, overall a good movie definitely worth watching and I'm looking forward to more Jamie. 2 post credits, the end one not worth it, it's a joke hahah 7.5/10.",7
" This does not suck and is sort of cute
","One of the best from DC and kinda endearing. This is cute-ish, and if this movie had came out 25 years ago we would probably be pretty happy with it. But this is a C-movie, and it does not cut it today, and being cute is not enough to win over viewers.<br><br>I have not liked a single one of the DC movies. Not even one. A couple of them have been watchable if you have had a few, and this is in that same general area of ""entertainment"". If you'd been gobbling down a 6-pack and a couple of shots, and you have a soft spot for cheesy cliche 1990s superhero movies than you might enjoy this. If you want quality, originality, good writing, good CGi and other things that make a good movie than this is not for you.<br><br>There are a few cool moments, a few laughs, a couple of scenes which is good, and the music score is pretty nice. But other than that this is simple, perhaps something cute, something old-timey flashback but also so cliche so you know what is going to happen from start to finish, but yea, so what? You have seen this a million times, why not a million and one time? You could actually do worse. So if you are a big fan of the character, you might even find this to be good or great.<br><br>I give this a very generous 4/10. Which I believe is the second highest I have given to the DC movies. And the reason is I do not think I wasted my money. Despite the score this is endearing and cute and sort of fun. But anyone claiming this is a good movie is delusional. This does not suck, but it does stink and you should be aware.",4
" One Word: Mediocre [6/10]
","My Reaction / Review for Blue Beetle (2023): So Jaime's family is about to lose the house? That sucks. Jaime looks like a very humble guy, I like that. Wait so it was that easy to steal the scarab? Wow, the first time that the scarab connects to Jaime it looks like a freaking horror movie. Why did he have to cut that bus in half, the scarab could easily avoid it, that's very dangerous with so many people in it. The scenes where the scarab gets activated for the first time were pretty fun. Rudy is a bit too much, its like he is screaming for some reason in every scene. So the uncle has some super tech that messes with the electronics and cameras? How convenient.<br><br>Also they go to Kord industries and there is no serucity or anything? That's dumb. Wait so Carapax has a scarab too or some other technology? First hour is decent, a 6.8/10 I would say, let's see if it gets better or worse. Wow there is no way to get rid of the scarab, its for life, that's kinda cool but at the same time it sucks. The dad is dead? Now its personal. Damn the dad's death made me emotional. Many times they talk in spanish, I would really appreciate some english subtitles but there are none... So now Rudy knows how to fly a spaceship? That's ridiculouus, this man can do anything the plot wants.<br><br>So now the grandma joins the fight? Cant take this seriously. And now the grandma shot three soldiers, so cringey and ridiculous. The 2nd half is so bad so far. The villain(s) in this movie are so not interesting. OK here is my conclusion. The movie is not bad but it is not great. The whole family thing was too much at some point, the humor is mostly bad, the dialogue could be better, the action scenes mediocre. The only thing I liked was Jaime's character. Overall a mediocre movie, its also like you've seen everything before and very predictable. My final rating is a 6/10.",6
" A Total Cliche
","I can't describe how hideous and misrepresented to the Mexican culture this film is. The Reyes family fits into the stereotypical Mexican family that hardly exists anymore.<br><br>Nowadays most of the Mexican families are out of this box concept an unlikely to just enjoy cumbia, salsa or reguetton music, unlikely to be all Catholics and pray always to the Virgen of Guadalupe, it's absurd to always have the same tacky misogynistic uncle, the nosey matriarcal granny or the submissive mother, neither to be so devoted to old popular tv shows like ""The Chapulín"" or novelas like ""María la del Barrio"" and call each other ""carnal"", ""goey"" or ""mijo"" like in this film. It's so tacky how Hollywood tries so hard to represent Latin American families and its people, in his way to be inclusive it just ended up being a huge mockery.",1

The Reyes family are supportive, sweet, loving and unashamed of their specific cultural identity. Apparently James Gunn did not have a huge amount of input on this, but this does work well as a lead in to his handling, aka the DCU: it cares deeply about its characters and ensures you do as well, there are great needle drops, and it really makes you care about someone that a lot of people currently do not.<br><br>I would say about a third of the quick fire jokes should have been trimmed out. There are times where it really feels like they're jingling keys in your face. The fairly frequent, fun if not always the most creative action features a lot of CG, and though it's definitely better than the Flash and Ant-Man 3, it's especially helped by the fact that this was clearly shot on actual locations and physical sets, not surrounded by green screen screens or on the volume. They actually did toss a stunt person through the air, that car was actually knocked over, etc.<br><br>Some of the violence in this really pushes the PG-13, and though there's not a huge amount of moderate to strong language in English, note that anyone speaking Spanish will pick up on some swearing there.

Lack of flashbacks: 7<br><br>This movie is a giant mess and doesn't understand what it is trying to be or tell.<br><br>The hero has a sister who constantly whines about how South American people have in hard in this city and how other people, likely White rich people, have it all and take it all no matter how hard these Mexican immigrants work so she doesn't even want to get an education or a proper job as it won't matter in her eyes. Yet the movie shows exactly why she is working low-paid jobs with no job prospects and her brother is working his way up. She uses a private bathroom then instead of trying to sneak herself out brags about her business while strolling out the stall catching the house owner, the evil lady, staring at her and firing her on the spot for being this dull headed. Anyone would have fired her here. She clearly shows she can't even follow basic rules or act civilized. And this type of behavior is constant from her so this one event just illustrated how she acts regularly. She's a racist hateful and extremely lazy uneducated worker. Her brother meanwhile just got this low-skill job and basically in what seems to be their first day gets a giant opportunity for getting a much better job in the company after being fired because of his sister. So a lead character got to explain her worldview with no one budding in and yet if you look at what is actually on screen it's the complete opposite. Yet there is never anyone to dispute any of the claims because the only White person here is the evil lady. They could have made this into some thematic debate yet she is just pure evil with no depth whatsoever.<br><br>There is also a plot about how the giant tech company didn't make the evil lady CEO and instead made her brother CEO even though she ran it. The movie calls it out as sexist and tells this small story several times over. Yet from the very first scene she is made out to be an evil maniac who doesn't mind killing innocent people to get her way. She's nasty and evil to the bone and extremely open about this threatening people to their face just for fun. Apparently she turned evil after her brother got her job and then took over the job later on. But this is a hard sell. She was a great CEO then by not getting to keep her job turned into an extremely coldhearted murderer? This is an experience millions of people have in real life where they don't get their fair share. You get turned down or lose your job for unfair reasons all the time. Maybe even once every 5 years if you work in a competitive industry. If all those people turned into psychopaths we would have a huge problem. A more logical explanation would be that she was always pure evil and just hid this as she was gifted power from a young age because of nepotism and didn't need to step on toes. People saw this and replaced her and she clawed her way back. Actually, this would be a BETTER story. Instead everything is sexist or racist here. She experienced sexism and she is apparently racist. There is nothing deeper here.<br><br>We also have the love interest literally cause a main death. An act that would make her hated forever in any real setting. Yet here they don't even mention it. Because obviously she's part of the good guys so her actions are therefore positive like in all other superhero movies. The movie doesn't care about what actually happens. It just forces a storyline into events that don't support this storyline whatsoever. It's like the writers didn't understand their own story which seems extremely common in modern movies that are largely produced. This trope scene is here, that trope scene is here. Step by step. Except they don't really create a storyline combined. Producers just selected them ahead of making the movie and forced a progressive immigrant theme onto everything and the writers just had to follow suit. Yet the themes are utter nonsense just forced into the movie via dialogue. It removes all depth and clearly this is why all actors phones it in.<br><br>Everything here is extreme cringe. The acting is horrible and all dialogue is extremely on the nose in a way where even kids would notice this. Which is extra offensive as this is made for Latin Americans and other DC movies weren't this childish and silly. So they investigated the main market for this movie and figured out they had to make all characters constantly say what they were doing as they figured viewers wouldn't get it otherwise. Superhero movie viewers are not the smartest group of people overall, but this is made for people who don't even understand basic movie stories and have never seen a superhero movie before. So are Latin Americans in USA this clueless about basic superhero stuff? They have never seen a single superhero movie before?<br><br>It's also extremely irritating how the lead does nothing. Everyone just pushes him around, but he's not even kind or smart. He's not even a clear weakling trying to stay safe. He's just nothing. He doesn't make any decisions and doesn't react or change things. His sister is bullying him because she's hateful and bigoted yet while they share parents he's completely different. They could at least have made him try to hide or avoid danger or responsibility like with Spiderman. Or made him into a regular guy trying to keep his life normal like with Clark Kent. Just some motivation in some direction even if it's something negative.<br><br>The story overall is also nonsense even if we ignore the extremely cringe moral stuff. In one scene they need to break into a building and randomly we learn that a family member has made an extremely advanced system to shut down any security system anywhere even though this is an extremely advanced building with a room full of security guards controlling the IT security. We never learn why he knew all this extremely advanced IT stuff as an old guy or why he acts like a poor clown living with his brother when he is actually a genius. In another scene regular characters pick up weapons and become superheroes right away. Zero training. This is what modern movies do wrong. They always want to have some young girl also be a superhero and then create superheroes out of whole families. Which could work in some cases if they received training first and could die. If they are just like the main character superhero then obviously it means nothing. In another scene the main character has something extremely wrong with his body and needs to seek help right away. Yet his family is afraid of cops as they are illegal aliens. So they forbid him to seek help and freak out when he does. Again, this makes zero sense. He's 22. Why would they let him suffer and potentially die just to remain hidden? Are they psychopaths? He's an American citizen who just got his diploma yet suddenly he's not allowed to talk to doctors or people who may help? What?<br><br>The movie looks and feels like a long episode of a dirt cheap TV show. But unfortunately TV shows have way better writing today. So besides the CGI being cheap and acting clearly all one-takes with no depth it doesn't even live up to a B tier TV show. Though I must admit some of the superhero TV shows are quite terrible. This is not just bad, this is unwatchable. And I am truly shocked that reviewers didn't notice the horrible acting and pathetic writing. Just watch the first 5 minutes. It's extremely clear this is not a good movie so how did people miss this?",3

" Cringe!
","The Blue Beetle movie redefines the word ""cringe."" From its painfully cliché dialogue to its cringe-worthy attempts at humor, every scene makes you want to crawl under your seat. The wooden acting and lackluster special effects further cement its status as a cringe fest. The plot, if you can call it that, is a mishmash of tired superhero tropes and predictable twists. The forced romantic subplot is cringe incarnate, with zero chemistry between the leads. Even the costume design seems like a bad cosplay.

" DC renews itself, Family or nothing, Love and fight for the ones you love.
","""Blue Beetle"" is a new DC movie that follows the box office success of ""Shazam!"" and ""The Flash."" The film stars Xolo Maridueña as a young superhero and is rated PG-13. The film is inspired by Latin culture and follows the story of a 22-year-old Mexican college grad with a cool family. Director Ángel Manuel Soto's fantasy adventure is familiar to fans of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming,"" ""Black Panther,"" and ""Iron Man,"" but features a main character's superteam instead of Batman and Wonder Woman. Jaime Reyes returns to Palmera City after graduating with a degree but faces a difficult situation as his parents, Rocio and Alberto, have shut down their auto shop and are about to lose their house in a gentrified area. Jaime meets Jenny Kord, who volunteers to help him find a job. However, things take a strange turn when Jenny gives Jaime a blue scarab, a valuable piece of alien biotechnology. Jaime takes the bug out of its box, and the otherworldly entity chooses him as a host, giving him a supersuit and cool abilities. ""Blue Beetle"" takes a Spider-Man comic playbook approach, putting Jaime through the wringer with his new powers, accidentally cutting a bus full of people in half, and even going to space. Maridueña's performance in the learning-to-be-a-superhero scenes is likable, allowing viewers to understand Jaime's strengths and insecurities. The world begins to fall apart as Victoria seeks Jaime to remove alien tech from his body. Jaime's openness to love adds humor and young-adult hormones. DC has had some crummy supervillains in recent years, and Sarandon's antagonist is one of the better examples. Victoria wants the scarab to help her create a One Man Army Corps of souped-up soldiers, including Carapax, a character tied to the controversial real-life School of the Americas. Jaime takes Victoria on with the help of his family, including his Nana, sister Milagro, and Uncle Rudy. Jaime's loving relatives ground his story and add a key sense of representation. The film's plot is grounded in the love and loyalty of Jaime's family, making it a relatable and entertaining story. ""Blue Beetle"" is a comic book series that features Jaime's transformation into a body horror character, blending lively personalities with a deep comic book mythology. The story revolves around Jenny's missing dad Ted Kord, the previous Blue Beetle. As the DC universe undergoes changes, fans can expect more of Jaime in the upcoming reset, highlighting the ongoing flux in the character. ""Blue Beetle"" is a politically spry film that explores the ills of white-American imperialism through the love and loyalty of its characters. The villain, Victoria, is a metaphor for the past and present, while the hero, Love, triumphs over self-discovery. The film's comedy focuses on how these characters mesh, rather than low-hanging memeification, and the family-bound narrative is pure and pure. ""Blue Beetle"" is a superhero film by Soto that despite its unremarkable action sequences, it still maintains vigor due to an entertaining ensemble. Adriana Barraza delivers punchlines, while George Lopez as Uncle Rudy delivers animated pratfalls and one-liners. The film's strength comes from its family, making it an enriching experience at the movies. Although it may not break the mold, it does break expectations. ""Blue Beetle"" is a film directed by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, which focuses on convenience and convenience. The story revolves around Jenny stealing a blue scarab, which Victoria uses to develop super-soldiers. Jenny then smuggles it into Jaime's hands, who is unaware of the scarab. Jaime becomes symbiotically linked to the scarab and gets a blue suit. The film's weakest components are the inarticulate composition of the characters, with the villain Victoria being portrayed as a stoic henchman. The film also lacks chemistry between Jenny and Jaime, partly due to Marquezine's overacting and overacting. The film's plot is a mix of nonsensical events and smart beats, but it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling story.",10

","This is a great way to start off Blue Beetle (2023)! The first impression is that it had good jokes that I laughed along with. The whole movie revolves around a comedy-action movie so there was plenty of jokes to go around with. The acting was great with everyone especially Jamie Reyes/Blue Beetle (Xolo Mariduena) making him a likable protagonist. George Lopez playing as Uncle Rudy was my favorite character because he was basically the comedian of the movie. It was glad to see him back on the big screen. The cinematography with the special effects and CGI was good of Blue Beetle himself and there was a lot of blue and purple color schemes going on. It was fresh to see an old DC character getting his own movie. Director Angel Manuel Soto does a great job of portraying Blue Beetle's origin story off to the world.

I saw another review mentioning the ""fascist"" comment - as a big fan of the character referenced, I still laughed out loud hearing it because it fits the wild energy of the character that said it (clearly intended as a joke). There's no secret agenda, it's a fun movie for a more obscure character, and I had a blast watching it.

" No honest critic rates this above 3!!!!
","Come on!!!! This is a terribly cliched backstory that uses pedantic, tired generalizations about Mexican Americans, supposing that NONE can ever escape poverty, no matter how much they study or how hard they work. Beyond that horrendously offensive characterization, we have the tired story of the lovelorn, reluctant hero that is unwittingly overtaken by an alien virus to become the hero. Sounds a lot like Venom...Just not as funny and with much poorer acting. The plot is just bad. Susan Sarandon is only slightly believable as an evil mastermind. Xolo is stretched beyond his apparent acting ability. And George Lopez is just George, but with a horrible goatee. 2/3 of the theater walked out of this tragic excuse for a superhero movie.

" Like watching the same NSFW video for the 100th time.
","I didn't have much expectations from this movie, with DC the bar is so low for me lately. The movie follows the standard origin story that we have seen so mantener times before:<br><br>A protagonist who is trying to live as best as he can his ordinary and mediocre life, is suddenly in contact with a ""special thing created by evil people"" that accidentally gives him superhero powers that he didn't ask for.<br><br>He struggles to control those powers, causing him to be in uncomfortable situations that cause him to wanna give up his powers and go back to his ordinary life.<br><br>But when the evil people begin threatening everyone he loves in order to get the powers he has, he is forced to do everything he can to save them, and make sure that those ""evil people"" never get those powers that could be used to destroy the world.<br><br>As you can see, this is not exactly what one w wouldn't call original stuff. Can it get more generic than this plot after 15 years of superhero movies?<br><br>The protagonists in this movie doesn't seem o have any agency or his own, he is pretty much nothing without his suit which does all the cool stuff for him, and also he is nothing without his family who saves him so many times.<br><br>The antagonists and their motivation is also super generic and so dated at this point:<br><br>""Oh wow, another movie where the entire world is at stake if the wrong hands get the magical stuff that gave him powers... Man I really wonder if this time the world is going to end"". ""Who knows maybe this time it will"".<br><br>This is not a movie i would recommend watching in the theatre, simply because it is not really a fresh story.

" Xolo you deserved way better
","Trying to be optimistic about the new DCU going into Blue Beetle I was hoping to see something a bit more fresh come from DC as whenever I saw this trailer come up in the theater it looked a bit basic but I kept thinking to myself there must be more to this if they're using this as the first film of the new universe. Boy oh boy, was I wrong, I seriously hope going forward that this is not the new baseline going forward. Blue Beetle felt possibly the closest thing I have seen to a slightly higher budget CW show but instead of evenly spreading its budget to everything equally they just spent most of it on the suit. I would easily rate this movie a star but the two extras are for the suit and Xolo, whom with a better script would definitely have been better. The jokes do not land whatsoever, in fact I swear I heard some of them done in other movies before, to call the story basic is too kind - it is literally the same story audiences have seen a hundred times, within the first 15 minutes you can practically predict where the entire plot is going to end up and somehow this movie makes it feel even more cheap. Not a great start to all of this, hope they keep the actor but do something completely different going forward.",3

" Apart of some Latino cultural aspects, Blue Beetle otherwise remains a standard superhero movie.
","Blue Beetle is a superhero action movie from Angel Manuel Soto, director of Twelve and La granja.<br><br>Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns home to his family, but learns that a lot has changed during his college years at home and his family has deteriorated financially. To help his family, he looks for a job, which he tries to find at the wealthy company Kord Industries. Here he comes into contact with Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), who asks him to help her smuggle something out of the company.<br><br>What Jaime smuggles out turns out to be an alien scarab, which Jaime chooses as a symbiotic host. This is how Jaime turns into the Blue Beetle. Now he must fight Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the boss of Ford Industries, who wanted to use the scarab for her own purpose. To counter the scarab, they try to threaten Jaime and his family, so Jaime as Blue Beetle now has to try to protect his family.<br><br>This movie was first going to be released on the HBO Max streaming service, but they later decided to release the movie in cinemas anyway. It was also unclear whether this film still belongs to the old DC Extended Universe film series, or at least as the start of the new DC Universe film series, this film series would start. James Gunn, the new CEO of the DC film series, was also growing past this himself at first, but eventually decided that the film would meet as the first film of his new DC film series, because he still wanted to use the character of Blue Beetle at the front of this film series. Despite meeting then anyway for this new movie series, the movie remains much of a standalone with no real further references to other DC movies to come in the future. James Gunn can still remember that.<br><br>Despite the uncertainty of which film series the film belongs to, the film itself remains a standard, standard superhero film, which does not bring much uniqueness. The movie is good about a Latino superhero, who carries this culture with him. This is something unique for a superhero movie.<br><br>Furthermore, the film seems to copy more superhero moments from other superhero films. For connoisseurs of this kind of film, the film can come across as a bit unoriginal and it remains on a predictable side without creating real tension.<br><br>The visual effects are also on the mediocre side with more of the quality you expect to see on a streaming service, which was also the idea for this film. For example, some of the effects appear less spread out.<br><br>Xolo Maridueña tries to be the main character for as many days as possible, but this is sometimes made difficult for him by the standard quality of the film. Still, just as if he meets the early seasons of the TV series Cobra Kai, he knows how to portray a character that you as a viewer care about. Just like with Cobra Kai when the focus shifts to several different characters, he falls more into the background. Together with the castles, which his other relatives play, they still come across as a family with a Latino culture. Sometimes they just often try to do unnecessary things, while this is not always necessary. The villains in the film also come across as a bit standard as cliché villains from a superhero movie, who have no real good reasons for their evil plans.",5

" 50% decent, 50% a pile of poop
","As blandly competent, cliched, and underwhelming as superhero films are becoming, Blue Beetle squanders an opportunity to do something truly new and revolutionary in favour of pulling remainders out of the recycling bin. While this latest DC offering does have some strong elements going for it, most of them revolving around the story's prominent Mexican-American representation, there's nothing inventive, new, or creative to be found within the actual story or it's mechanics. Blue Beetle is a boilerplate film welded together out of useable spare parts lifted from more successful and entertaining superhero films. Instead of redefining a genre and imbuing it with new life via a vibrant cultural backbone, Blue Beetle only further enhances the feelings of growing superhero fatigue. Let's start with the handful of things that work well in Blue Beetle, beginning and almost ending with the rich family dynamic that gives the film all of it's heart.<br><br>The ""best"" moments in Blue Beetle come whenever the film simply lets the family members be themselves, the worst part that the drama does not exists, there was tons of Español musics. It does not larger cogs in a big budget, effects laden machine. This film is as generic as they come, we have seen it all before and done a lot better. The script could have easily been created by A. I. that watched a thousand hours of superhero films! Every detail of the adventure and backstory in Blue Beetle has been cobbled together from spare parts left over from Man of Steel, The Flash, every Batman film, every Spider-Man film (someone might as well just say ""with great power comes great responsibility"" here and just make it more obvious), Iron Man, Shazam, and Ant-Man.<br><br>Blue Beetle is frustrating and forgettable because the potential for something better is evident, but it settles for the path most travelled instead. In my honest opinion, I don't think this film stands a chance at the box office, it reeks of writing by committee and corporate meddling. Blue Beetle isn't one of the worst films of the year, but it's absolutely one of the most disappointingly average ones.",5

" Best DC Family Film this year....
",Blue Beetle is said to be one of the best DC Family film this year. This movie has everything store for the audience. From Superhero fans to the general family audience all can enjoy this film with a happy face. Movie tells us about the Blue Beetle origin of how a boy from a middle class family gets consulted by a scarab and what situation does he face after getting that scarab into his life.<br><br>The best thing about this film is it does not focus only on one character and the situation what he face but the whole family gets stucked into it and how they deal with that situation. Family Reunion and the way director has shown the Reyes family was one of the highlight of the film. The origin story doesn't hit you very much as it has same old vibe of origin superhero movies and sometimes you'll also remind some of the comic origin movies that are similar to this film.<br><br>CGI &amp; Action Sequences are top notch and specially the suit design looks cool and Whenever the suit uses it's different techs while fighting is a treat to watch with perfect cgi elements. XOLO has shined throughout the film and gave the character full justice so as the rest of the cast with acting performance too. Villain is one of the major problem of the superhero films and this film also faces the same issues because it doesn't show or the story justifies the strong villain character and at the end movie becomes average with old typical ending.<br><br>All n all it's a fresh origin story with amazing cgi shots and action sequences plus a family drama with good acting performances which you can definitely enjoy and give this film a One time watch...,6
" Okay
","It was okay.<br><br>It's the typical superhero movie with some fun action moments and solid performances from the cast members. DC Comics has made some pretty good superhero movies in the past but also some pretty bad ones too. Blue Beetle was mainly okay. Throughout, there were some pretty good productions and the superhero/action moments were solid with some fun fight sequences and colorful effects. The direction was alright but there were a few moments that felt a little sloppy. The performances from the cast members were mostly good as Xolo Maridueña does a pretty good job performing his role as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle alongside Susan Sarandon, Adriana Barraza and George Lopez as well.<br><br>For the story, it was fine. It didn't feel too special or as interesting as some of the other superhero stories. Throughout, the camerawork has some solid shot moments and while the humor was mostly meh, there were a few good humor moments. The characters were okay but they weren't fully investing to connect with. There are some dialogue moments that could improve and the uses of special effects and CGI were good. However, there are some not so great CGI aspects but it is definitely better than The Flash.<br><br>If this movie had came out in the 1990s, I feel like it would have been an smashing hit. Overall, it's not the best DC Comics movie but it does have some good entertaining moments and it's an okay pop-corn piece of entertainment.",5

" A fantastic origin movie
","Blue Beetle (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters this afternoon. The storyline follows a young man who is returning home from college to find his family struggling. He hopes to use his degree to make enough money to bail out his family. He bumps into a millionaire board member while in the process of losing his job and continues discussions after the interaction. They decide to meet up; and in doing sow, the lady hands him a scarab she doesn't trust her company with. The scarab turns him into a super hero and this is the Blue Beetle Origin Story.<br><br>This is directed by Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City King) and stars Xolo Maridueña (Cobra Kai), Bruna Marquezine (God Save the King), George Lopez (Balls of Fury), Susan Sarandon (Thelma &amp; Luis), Damián Alcázar (Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian) and Belissa Escobedo (Hocus Pocus 2).<br><br>This is a fantastic origin movie. The writing and storyline makes you care about every character in the family...and this movie is really about family at its heart. You genuinely are very invested in what happens to whom. The CGI is top notch and the action scenes are fantastic. Blue Beetle's super powers are well depicted and fun to watch in action. A few scenes reminded me of the video games Soul Caliber and Mortal Kombat. The ending is sad, triumphant and does bring hope. George Lopez is absolutely awesome in this picture and keeps a fun pace to the film with his brand of comedy. Susan Sarandon was also a solid villain.<br><br>Overall, this is an entertaining origin story and worthwhile addition to the super hero genre. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",8
" ""Superhero Snooze: blue beetle Fails to Soar""
","From start to finish, blue beetle fails to deliver the excitement and engagement that one would expect from a superhero film. Despite the promise of epic battles and thrilling heroics, the movie falls flat in almost every aspect.<br><br>The plot feels disjointed and lacks a clear sense of direction. The filmmakers attempt to incorporate multiple storylines and subplots, resulting in a cluttered narrative that's difficult to follow. This confusion extends to the characters, who lack depth and development. Even the titular superhero feels one-dimensional, making it hard to empathize or connect with their struggles.<br><br>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of blue beetle is its failure to capitalize on the potential for social commentary that the superhero genre often offers. The movie seems content to stick to tired clichés rather than explore meaningful themes or address relevant issues.",1
" The Scarab
","That's the more appropriate title for this movie, cause apparently the Blue Beetle isn't the Scarab. The one which crawled up Jaime's ass wasn't Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle was Jenny's Dad in his superhero form. False title if you ask me. The background story was uninteresting enough to pull the audience in. They should've shown more background on the Scarab. Where does it come from, what it actually is, what's its purpose. It'll give the audience more depth to tune in. The villain has created the bare minimum of threat to anyone to show any significance to be dealt with. So there's one more less reason to watch this movie. Usually Susan Sarandon delivers awesome performance either as an antagonist or protagonist. But in this movie, she kinda hovers around. But I understand that it wasn't her fault. She can only do so much with the script that's given to her. I feel bad for her. But alas, even with the negative reviews I've written, I still can't give it less than 6 stars. Cause at least it's more interesting than Black Widow. And I think the real Blue Beetle is coming in the next installment of this movie. I hope they'll do better next time. I'm giving it another star to give the writers some encouragement.",7
" Cliched but charming
","A very generic superhero movie because of how many of these have been coming out and yet it manages to be a fun one with some nice touches in it. The Mexican-American culture feels properly ingrained into it and the comedy works out well because of the heart in it. The lead actor was pretty charming and his family was also really lovely in their roles. The Blue Beetle suit looks incredible because it's mostly an actual suit rather than complete CGI and the hand-to-hand action looks really nifty. The director knows how to properly compose scenes, with proper length in drama and action without chopping them up. But still, the movie is a pretty straightforward superhero origin story with only a few bits and pieces of freshness in it and some tried and tired cliches. Overall, this is only for those who really enjoy superhero films in general. With the superhero fatigue, it's no wonder there were only like 10 people in the theater.",6
" DC (almost) finishes himself off with another generic film.
","When you think of a generic and formulaic superhero movie, you're possibly thinking of a C-grade villain without any depth to it, mediocre photography, sub-par visual effects, a predictable CGI-fest third act, horrible one-liners, and laughable acting.<br><br>Blue Beetle contains all of the above. While DC is going through a thorough restructuring, Blue Beetle suffers from the former ownership which ignored good stories for maximizing revenue.<br><br>Nonetheless, Xolo Maridueña is great as Blue Beetle, and we can't wait for him to show up in future DCU installments.<br><br>The movie is a forgettable piece of film that will be good for getting a few laughs, and not caring about the story or fights, or stakes.

But none of these films featured a Latino dude so here we go, now we have a Latino one too now. But literally nothing else new. DCEU movies used to be dark but then I guess Warner Brothers saw a little humour adds to the movie so they started doing that too, it kind of worked in other DCEU movies but not in this one, it's not funny it's just plain lame. What's up with the fighter grandma jokes? Oh my god, this movie is so cringe. It used to be Wonder Woman 2 but this is now the worst DCEU movie ever made.",2
" Inherently bad!
","I swear Hollywood gave up on the superhero genre and all they produce nowadays turns out to be an underwhelming garbage and this movie is no exception. There were only 2 nice minutes out of the disappointing +2 hours runtime that you may label watchable. The story has nothing interesting going for it, the cast carried an embarrassing underwhelming performance and the characters were as bland and generic as any family superhero movie you can imagine. A superhero movie is nothing without a worthy villain which this obviously didn't have, instead we got a cardboard villain picked up from the nearest dumpster. No matter how you look at it, this is a disappointing superhero/family movie.",3
" BThis Beetle Did Not Leave Me Blue
","LIKES:<br><br>The Music:
-A simple like for some, the music has a bit of a mixture that is fun, toe tapping, and representative of the moment.<br><br>-Hispanic raps and ballads have melodrama and that spice at moments with their catchy beats and vocals.<br><br>-Other songs are that hip hop attitude that comes at the perfect moment to go with the impressive action and training moments. Really pushing the boundaries
-And the symphony songs are quite impressive when they come out in key moments.<br><br>The Comedy:
-A big selling point, Blue Beetle is a lot of slapstick and jokes that might get excessive for some.<br><br>-If you are Hispanic and have the relevance, it makes the comedy even better, as the cultural references are a deck of cards lined to be a winning hand.<br><br>-While others are less specific, with great execution, timing, and quirkiness that I had fun with when it all came together.<br><br>-And those who like uncoordinated tripping, stumbling, and accident prone comedy work to help raise the torch.<br><br>-While not the most unique, it works for a comic book movie and has a place with a lot of other elements in this movie.<br><br>The Story:
-The movie works to add elements that are good for an origin movie trying to reset a big universe.<br><br>-We have a character arc, some tragic events to put pressure to meet them, a few representable villains, and the growing pains coming with the new power.<br><br>-It has enough of these elements to blend mostly well, and I enjoyed a lot of the building this movie did with elements that have emotion, growth, and fire that I want in these movies.<br><br>-And throw everything together within two hours to give you a concise story that is not too convoluted or thought provoking.<br><br>The Acting:
-It's a comic book movie, and though we have seen monuments to the acting trade in some other films worthy of pedestal raising.<br><br>-This movie is not bad, in fact good, for what I call the standard way of comic book movies, with a cast that is likeable, feels like a family, and has a bit more realistic feel.<br><br>-Becky G's voice is not so much singing, and her new interaction as the Beetle's brain is funny, robotic, and near the end shows elements similar to Jarvis.<br><br>-Bruna Marquezine has a commanding prowess to her. A balanced array of strength and vulnerability, matched with a real character that works well with the various groups she has to be with.<br><br>-And Xolo Mariduena the lead is sensational. He's funny, charming, delivers his awkward young adult lines well, but grows into some more engaging moments that match the early days of Marvel and D. C. movies.<br><br>-And George Lopez is... well Lopez. He works as both comedic relief and a good plot device, which might be annoying and old cad to some, but again holds merit in this movie and build up.<br><br>The Effects... to some degree:
-The effects are what you expect in this movie, and DC continues to put out some impressive moments that worked for me.<br><br>-Seeing the Blue Beetle fly, alongside his fighting mechanics was good for CGI to most degrees.<br><br>-Fluid animation, good shifting changes using hard light technology, and a few other things that made the currently impossible, possible.<br><br>-And with explosions and fires having some practical effects helps further blending of the worlds make it a little easier on the fakeness.<br><br>The Action:
-It's a little meager to start with as the suit gets time to adjust, but once it does... I was happy.<br><br>-Blue Beetle has several varieties of action to it, utilizing the start of the abilities and adding a little strategy to the mix up.<br><br>-Impressive blasting, some good choreography, and helping add a little physical combat offered some mix up to the moments, and with the other things mentioned work to craft a comic worthy battle.<br><br>-Good cinema alongside adding story elements to it only further enhanced the experience for me, and made most of the fighting in the small time.<br><br>DISLIKES:<br><br>The Comedy a Tad Excessive:
-If you have a high tolerance or an attitude of never enough comedy, you'll have no beef with this category.<br><br>-For me, there are times where the emotional moments and developments are overtaken by another Spanish driven rant, or another screaming bout.<br><br>-It gets a little tiresome to hear Lopez cry and scream at every other word of his, but it's not the worst compared to some of the other movies I've seen with overutilization.<br><br>Predictable Story:
-I know that originality is tough to acquire these days, but this movie was very easy to guess what was happening.<br><br>-Foreshadowing paints an obvious direction this film is going and it takes some of the twists and surprise that you might want in a film like this and an edge.<br><br>-It all ties up about as I expected, and I think could be part of the boring part that people talk about in their reviews.<br><br>The Visuals Dip Into Mediocre At Times
-I know this isn't meant to be the most realistic of movies, but Blue Beetle does things well for the most part.<br><br>-However, there are times that the movie sort of dips in the frame rates and smoothness and gets lost in the hokey fake tones.<br><br>-Blue Beetle has some polishing to do if they get the okay for a second movie. Maybe a little more blending of the real and the CGI to help blend things. Alongside some better depth and details.<br><br>-Again, it's not as big for me for most of the movie, but there are some times where post editing was a tad too inconsistent.<br><br>More Action At The End With Other Characters:
-There is a part where the movie is about planning out the final battle well and using the players.<br><br>-They kind of do this, but it's underwhelming and used more comedically than that cool finesse to the grand finale.<br><br>-Blue Beetle picks up the slack, but everyone else is kind of a waste when the potential was there to soar or fly like the character.<br><br>-Given some of the fun aspects they were going to look at, but then just dropped or ran out of time or creativity.<br><br>-This happens a lot at the end with a lot of characters, and this might be the biggest dislike for me that I hope will expand in the next attempt at the DC universe.<br><br>The VERDICT:
Blue Beetle is the supposed start to the Gunn universe, and I had a lot of fun with the movie. It's nothing spectacular, mind blowing, earth shattering, or really sand out like they were int eh past, but that doesn't mean it's a throw away movie for me. The film works well with comedy, origin story, and characters, to make an entertaining build of the world and just focusing on the movie itself. While there are hints at what is to come, the movie is trying to just be a comic book come to life, and bring the punches that comics can only do with a good imagination. And the way they utilize references, technology, and action that I really enjoyed and would have liked a little more of. Yet, the movie is indeed predictable in story terms, a tad excessive at times, and needs some polishing to really hit a consistent B and A gam. Blue Beetle may not be the redefining piece many are still looking for, but it was still a fun incursion with enough gusto to dip into the movie theater. My scores for this piece are:<br><br>Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",8
" What an absolutely disgusting movie
","CGI wasn't bad, that's about the only positive for the entire movie.<br><br>The rest from the casting, to the music, to the plot, to everything else, was disgustingly terrible.<br><br>Over the top stereotypes for basically every last character. With actors and comedians who had no right being cast in any type of role, looking mainly at George Lopez, he was terrible and not even mildly funny... so it's clear he drew on his massive repertoire of a career as a ""comedian"".<br><br>The action was pretty ho hum, not a single power of the suit was explained in any way, let alone well.<br><br>The OMAC suit wasn't a terrible premise, but it was shown terribly, along with fabrication of metal out of nowhere..... have we completely left any semblance of this taking place on an earth like planet???<br><br>I finished it, but really should have taken the other reviews at face value.<br><br>Overall this was aimed at folks who enjoyed power rangers or other really campy style shows for children.",2
" Suffers badly from superhero fatigue
","Fed with superhero movies? You will be after watching this or Shazam or Black Adam or Ant Man 3 or Aquaman 2 (probably).<br><br>If this would have come out two or three years ago it might have been better received, however, today we are an era of superhero fatigue where ever movie seems the same as the last.<br><br>The first hour or so is passable. The last hour is not. The bits that killed it for me where George Lopez becoming a scientist, security expert and alien spacecraft pilot overnight. Pitiful.<br><br>The last hour dragged. We always knew how the story was going end. And it did. Maybe BB will join up with the Justice League in the future although this time without the annoying family in tow.",4
" Trash
","Plot was trash, writing trash, even the villian was trash lol. Only thing enjoyable about the movie was the execution of the suit. DC really can't get it right these days 🤣. They should stick to animation, cuz this not it.<br><br>I see why this went to streaming in just 3 weeks of being released in theaters. It's like they didn't even try to make it interesting and you don't get invested in any of the characters. Not to mention the scenes that don't make any sense, but appear to be straight up shortcuts. Felt like I was watching spy kids and the movie was more about the entire family than the blue beetle.",3
" Not good
","I just saw Blue Beetle, and I did not really like it that much, I enjoyed the first 40 minutes, and some 10 minutes towards the end, but everything else just felt like the same stuff we have seen thousands of times, I was pretty board throughout the movie, and I did not really care about most of what was going on, there was one seen that I thought was pretty cool, and I do like the more emotional moments in the movie, but overall, I was really bored and waiting for it to end, I think I should mention that I do not like superhero movies, which could be part of the reason why I did not like this movie, and if you like superhero movies, then you might like Blue Beetle, because it is like every superhero movie ever, if you have seen a superhero movie, you have seen Blue Beetle, overall, I give this a 5/10, a boring movie that I might recommend if you like superhero films, but just not for me.",5
" Another generic superhero movie
","Honestly the movie was just meh. It's an ok watch. Not a great start to James Gunns universe. The script was not good and it felt like it wasn't even blue beetles movie. It felt like he was a side character in his own movie. The story felt really flat and once again another villain with out purpose of being bad. It's just a flat boring superhero movie we've been getting for the past 5 years. The movie should've been about the scarab and introduce the reach who made it. Instead it felt more of his family origin story becoming ""heros"" instead of blue beetles origin. What we saw of him becoming blue beetles origin felt rushed. The best part about this movie was xolo and the suit. He did a great job for his first big screen appearance and he has a bright future. His sister wasn't that good at acting and neither was the mom. The father was great and George Lopez was alright. The Grandma was just eh. They made the movie too funny and oftentimes it was too much and forced. And there was too much propaganda in this film. I'm Mexican and Puerto Rican and it was too much. I was annoyed when they said the government has no problem with locking up Mexicans. It was just too much. And half of the time something that came out of George Lopezs mouth it was something about the government being against Mexicans.",4
" Even for the botom level of DC and Disney this movie is worse
","Writing is terrible, one more superhero is destroyed. They screaming half of the movie. All the charactehrs are very unlickable and stupid. The worst are the characters of uncle and the villainess. The only good character is father, but he have only two scenes in the movie and one of the villains at least have a good finale. Special effects are not bad, but after hard hit from the rest parts of the movie, you absolutely don't care. Dind't notice any acting, but even real superhero would not raise such bad script. One third of the dialogues are in spanish, be ready to randomly after the half of the phrase to lower you look to the subtitles. This didn't add anything good to the movie but add ESG score to WB. Syntwave music sounds good but don't fit in this movie at all, it's standart good syntwave, you can even turn over the music from end.to begining and nothing would change.<br><br>It's not hero origin from 2000 like other reviews says, it's terrible movie from 2023. Even after first Shazam i had the expectations for the second, but only good thing i can do with Blue beetle is to forget this movie.",1
" The most generic possible
","It's just that the movie is very, very, very generic. If you don't mind that, it's okay, but I'm tired of almost every superhero movie being the same thing.<br><br>Additionally, the portrayal of the villain in the movie leaves much to be desired.<br><br>The character lacks depth and originality, coming across as a mere cliché rather than a compelling antagonist. This contributes to the overall sense of the film being generic.<br><br>The plot follows a familiar pattern that has been seen in numerous superhero movies before. The storyline unfolds predictably, with little deviation from the standard narrative formula. From the hero's origin story to the inevitable clash between good and evil, every beat seems to adhere to a formulaic structure.

Explosions, dramatic showdowns, and CGI effects are all present, yet they lack the creativity that could elevate them beyond the ordinary.<br><br>In a landscape where superhero movies dominate the cinema, it's disheartening to find that the majority fall into the trap of sameness.

" Blue Beetle strives to be a good superhero film and succeeds bringing a story full of heart, Xolo Maridueña being a highlight
","Blue Beetle was directed by Angel Manuel Soto and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. I expected this film to be focused on the family side and overall drama of Jaime Reyes' life, mostly because of the film Soto directed, Charm City Kings which was a film I loved. This is a superhero film for the entire family, with themes focusing on family but especially displacement, colonialism, and gentrification in terms of what the director said about the film's themes.<br><br>For this film and Superhero, I don't have vast amount of knowledge of Blue Beetle except for some comics and especially the Young Justice show and Injustice 2, but this film made a great job at showing the character and hero for a new audience, hopefully even making him into a well known one.<br><br>An alien scarab chooses college graduate Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the teenager with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle.<br><br>The film stars Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle alongside Bruna Marquezine, Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon, and George Lopez. Having seen Xolo Maridueña in Cobra Kai, I've seen both his capabilities of a dramatic actor and in action sequences, when he was cast in this role I was behind it 100%. Having now seen the film I think he's what makes it decent to good. The costume design was on point, especially the Blue Beetle costume. It's inspired by Young Justice and Injustice 2 along with other versions of the costume. Filming was done mainly at location and with heavy use of practical effects, such as the Blue Beetle suit. The director felt that the use of real-life locations allowed for the practical effects to be better integrated into the movie. Thus making it rely less on CGI and instead of what is best, practical effects. I really liked the action sequences, both how it was shot and edited. I think the film looks really good, great cinematography. I really liked the characters and actors playing them; Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord, Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord and Damián Alcázar as Alberto Reyes being three who impressed me.<br><br>What Blue Beetle does extremely well is how they keep it family-focused and embraces the lore preceding this Blue Beetle, I'm of course talking about Ted Kord and Dan Garrett, the film also have a lot of heart. Critics found it to have plenty of humor and yes it does, but I felt most of the jokes fell flat because of how childish they were then again the majority of the audience was children when I saw it at the cinema. The highlight for me is Xolo Maridueña's magnetic performance in the title role, he's just terrific and does such a good job bringing the comic book character to life. The writer and director does too, a very fine bringing the story and origin to life. Blue Beetle is a fun little movie, using each million of its budget to good use, you kind of see why it was supposed to go straight to streaming as it looks quite cheap at times (mostly the antagonist and the visual effects to him, Raoul Max Trujillo as Ignacio Carapax / OMAC). But it's a good film, a good superhero film and worth your time.",7
" It could've been worse
",Maybe focusing more on plot than making political statements could've helped? But that wouldn't make up for the bad acting. George Lopez almost single handedly ruined the movie. The plot holes were as numerous as the empty seats in the theater. The attempts at comedy were terrible misses. I'm assuming it was geared towards a certain audience but I honestly can't think of any demographic that would enjoy this movie in its entirety. The fight sequences were the only saving grace. If you lose a bet and are forced to take your worst enemy to a movie this is the one for you. I'm being overly generous with the 4/10.,4

Gets superhero powers and starts whining and complaining that his life is changed forever. Get a grip! Anyone in that situation would be pretty happy with that situation. Also whoever cast the 'villain' lady needs to be fired. About as threatening as Blue Beetles granny. Was surprised they didn't have a boss battle with the two granny's at the end.",4
" Revels in the base of stereotypes - shocking

","My husband and I are movie nerds, particularly when it comes to Marvel and DCU, and we both felt the same about this movie - disappointed.<br><br>What really gets me going watching a superhero movie is watching the development of the 'heroes journey', where it builds and you see them grow as a character, you get their background, why they are chosen, and see them slowly get their power and find their way. I felt this journey was seriously lacking in this movie as it was all geared around the family and while I get the intention behind it, the family was just cringe, annoying and the movie was unbalanced between them getting 'hilarious' screen time and Jaimie's growth as a character.<br><br>Jaimie spent most of the movie terrified, and didn't really get badass until the last 15 minutes, and to be frank, nothing was really about Jaimie at all until then, either his family controlled the screen time or his suit did all the work, I wanted to see more of Jaimie really becoming 'one' with it, and the story behind that, not his grandma floundering around, cackling with a gun blaster.<br><br>Also, why did the beetle even choose Jaimie in the first place? We didn't get any answers with that either! There's so much they could have explored with that as well and so many wasted opportunities in this movie.<br><br>I think the other reviewers questioning the Mexican representation almost being offensive is also worth bearing in mind, although it was all part of the cringe factor for me.<br><br>I really hope IF they do another Blue Beetle, the family take more of a backseat and we get to see more of Jaimie as a character.",4

It doesn't do much new, or even breaks any new ground in the superhero movie genre (not that there's any left to be broken anyway).<br><br>I did like the family dynamics a little, but if anyone's seen Ms. Marvel of the MCU (that makes like, ten people including me), it will all seem a little too familiar, except this time they are Latino.

I LOVED the cast, from the kind-hearted dad, to the sarcastic sister, to the spunky grandma. The actor who plays the protagonist (love him in Cobra Kai) did such a great job in the lead role. Step aside, Fast and Furious franchise; THIS is how you incorporate a ""family"" theme into your movie. I laughed and I cried several times throughout.

His transformation feels like a horror movie transformation and the hero of course doesn't kill people (rolls eyes) but that rule doesn't apply to all the other good guys. They violently kill and make jokes about it. One of its biggest issues is how it is supposed to connect to the DC universe going forward. It doesn't do anything to answer any of those questions. Then there is the racial undertones that seem unnecessary and hurt the movie and again push the us vs them issue instead of trying to unite people. At least it was sort of subtle and could be missed.,7
" A cookie-cutter superhero origin story that leaves little else to the imagination
","""Blue Beetle"" is a superhero film serving as the 14th installment in the DC Extended Universe. Starring Xolo Maridueña in the title role, it functions as a cookie-cutter superhero origin story that leaves little else to the imagination.<br><br>After recently graduating from university, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns to his hometown in Palmera City. While awaiting a job opportunity at Kord Tower, Jaime is handed a small box by Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), the niece of the company CEO Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). Jenny tells Jaime to guard the box with his life and ensure its contents don't fall into the wrong hands. Upon arriving back home, Jaime's family convince him to open the box where they soon discover it contains a mysterious alien Scarab. When Jaime touches the Scarab, it fuses with his body, giving him a durable exoskeleton and super powers that allow him to become the hero known as the ""Blue Beetle"".<br><br>Ever since the character's first appearance in 1939, the superhero Blue Beetle has undergone not one but three different canon iterations. The most recent of which is Jaime Reyes, whom upon debuting in 2006, has gone on to become arguably the most recognisable version of the character. From appearing on the TV series ""Smallville"" to being playable in various DC video games, it seems that the Reyes incarnation of Blue Beetle is the one that resonates most prominently with both modern comic book fans and novices alike. In 2023, the character made his live action film debut in the DC Extended Universe's ""Blue Beetle"", a cut-and-paste origin story adventure that feels all too familiar.<br><br>There's hardly anything this film does that hasn't already been done in almost every superhero movie before it. From the very beginning, it's hard not to have a feeling of deja vu when the set up is first introduced to us. We watch as a team of explorers uncover an otherworldly artefact in Antarctica, which is then immediately handed over to a big-shot CEO of a major company who plans to use it for sinister purposes. Afterwards, we see the protagonist inadvertently becoming involved with said artefact, and using it to fight back against the villainous CEO before it is too late. Does that sound familiar to anyone? If it does then that's because the superhero genre has reached a point where it is near impossible for an origin story to follow any other set pattern. As a result, the film feels dated right out of the box. There simply isn't much entertainment value to be had other than perhaps through the occasional jokes about the lead character's ethnic origins. Maybe it's just superhero fatigue finally setting in, but I found nothing else worth mentioning about the film's plot.<br><br>With that in mind, the film at least does a nice enough job at investing the audience in its overarching theme of familial bonding, something which is heavily emphasised in Latin American culture. Though they do feel a bit generic at times, I did like the parts where Jaime fights to protect those he cares about. The best scenes were when Jaime is learning about what powers he has and noticing that his family members support him along the way. It is clear here that the Reyes family have each other's backs no matter what, which is especially evident given how often they are seen placed in the way of danger. Without giving away spoilers, I particularly liked one scene that made great use of the family dynamic when they are required to fight back against a large number of enemies. In most other films, the main character's family members are either relegated to the background or end up used as a cheap plot device to move the story along, but here they are all used quite nicely. Even Jaime's elderly grandmother has a highlight moment.<br><br>In the lead role, Xolo Maridueña was the perfect choice to play the eponymous character, not merely due to his Latin heritage but also because of the physicality involved. Anybody who watched Maridueña on ""Cobra Kai"" will likely remember his ability to handle himself in combat, dishing out blow after blow against his adversaries. It's just a shame that Jaime Reyes is so generically written in this movie, like somebody took Peter Parker/Spider-Man and gave him a Latin American paint job. That's not to say I disliked him as a whole, the problem is that I couldn't see anything in him that hasn't been done before in every other young, inexperienced, down-to-earth superhero protagonist since the genre first began. Still, there's room for growth should the character ever appear in a future DC film project.<br><br>As previously mentioned, the Reyes family are what I would consider to be the emotional backbone for this film. Jaime's grandmother, known simply as ""Nana"", certainly knew how to hold her own whenever things got tough and Adriana Barraza's performance helped make her seem like she could definitely manage it. Nana was my favourite of Jaime's relatives because she seemed like someone with not only the necessary life experience but also the toughness to go along with it. Coming a close second would be Jaime's sister Milagro, played by Belissa Escobedo. Milagro is the type of younger sibling most of us would dream of having, always there to back you up in a pinch and never giving up on you when things turn ugly. In spite of the rest of the film's issues, It's comforting to see a superhero film that places such a strong significance on family values.<br><br>However, I think Susan Sarandon was wasted as the film's main antagonist Victoria Kord. Her character is so one-dimensional and uninteresting that virtually any other actor/actress could have played the role. Kord is nothing more than your run-of-the-mill greedy CEO villain - she's rich, she's powerful, and she wants to destroy the hero at all costs. That's about it. Though they do attempt to give her some sympathetic backstory, it is never properly expanded upon beyond the fact that her family life is the polar opposite to Jaime's. This could have been a great opportunity to have made her a more layered character but instead the filmmakers played it too safe and her end fate is about as predictable as they come.<br><br>When taking into consideration the varied quality of the DC Extended Universe, I suppose you could do a whole lot worse than ""Blue Beetle"". It serves its purpose as an obligatory introduction to the character for the uninitiated and sets the stage for his potential return should the studio executives see fit. The film's saving grace is its wholesome view on the necessity of having a loving family, which itself is hardly an original concept (the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies have been doing this for years). With all that said, I can only really recommend this film to hardcore fans of DC, because there are so many other better movies out there that are a more valuable use of one's time.<br><br>I rate it 6/10.",6
" Trainwreck, avoid at all cost
","This was bad on so many levels. All the characters but few are annoying. Story is a copied cliché superhero story. They took elements from all other superhero movies (and mostly from their competition - Marvel) and recycled them into this one. Almost everything this movie offers, you have already seen a better version of it in other superhero movies. And let me repeat again, a huge majority of characters are incredibly annoying. They are trying too hard to force you to laugh, which just leaves you annoyed and furious at yourself for spending your money to watch this heap of cinematic junk. And mind you, I spent $3 to watch this. Still not worth it.<br><br>2/10 just because I've seen even worse.",2
" Another Unremarkable Entry !!
","I don't quite follow the thinking of makers nowadays. What do yo really wanna achieve?? Do they only aim to make money?? Maybe then these movies do make sense cause I don't find anything new or rememberable in them.<br><br>If you really wanna earn respect and attention then you absolutely need a lot more than just an ordinary family friendly good for nothing story. A guy somehow accidentally get superpowers and for next 2 hours same lame family drama, jokes and totally useless character development. And then what? Is there anything that I should remember? Is there anything that I should connect with?<br><br>I think they really need to try something new and unique cause standalone movie are good for nothing if they are not impactful and remarkable.<br><br>Otherwise try to focus on interconnected movies, that would be much better unless you just only want to make money and nothing else.",4
" Waste of time
","This is definitely one of the worse DC movie ever, Character development, dialogues, story, whatever you look for in a good movie, it's definitely missing in this one. Totally predictable. May be fine for kids who would be happy to see some colours here and there otherwise this movie has nothing to offer for anyone who is looking to spend some good time. There is no sense in this movie plot. Unnecessary drama, and needlessly prolonged scenes. DC could use some good writers and directors who can present the movie in somewhat better way. I never thought that I would be disappointed this much by any movie.",2
" Bland, unoriginal and you've seen it a million times
","There's nothing about Blue Beetle that makes it stand out in any positive way against the numerous other superhero movies around. It's like a movie made to be forgotten. Literally everything about Blue Beetle feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to make a superhero movie based on every other superhero movie ever made.<br><br>And what on earth is this new trend of creating unbearably annoying over the top characters we're supposed to be rooting for? It's supposed to be endearing to watch a bunch of people act like they're all developmentally disabled because... family? Especially the main character's sister; who ends up being a patience tester in how annoying she was throughout, and the worst part about it is knowing that it's not actually supposed to annoy us, but to make us empathize with what a cool sister she is. Like, no, please, stop. There wasn't a single likeable character in that entire family (except maybe the dad, who at best was just around)... the sister, the mom, the uncle and the grandma... Oh man, the grandma. I would hate life if that was my family.<br><br>Even with all that, it would be a little unfair to call it a bad movie. It's somewhere between below-average to average depending on how annoyed I am I guess. And no, there's nothing new here for you to have to check out, but if you still feel like you want to, you're not going to be disappointed either.",5
" Not your usual superhero movie.
","Blue Beetle tells the story of Jaime Reyes(Xolo Mariduena). An extraterrestrial scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, giving him superpowers that alters his life forever. Jaime becomes the superhero, known as Blue Beetle.<br><br>Blue Beetle is a mind-blowing film. Director Angel Manuel Soto has given us a superhero movie that shines the spotlight on the titular character's family, while also giving us unlimited humor &amp; heart. The action set pieces are phenomenal. The visual effects are perfect. The background score by Bobby Krlic is electrifying &amp; unique, compared to the usual superhero movie background music. The performances are the standout of the film. Xolo Mariduena knocks it out of the park, as Jaime Reyes. Mariduena gives us another spectacular performance after his starring role in fan-favorite, Cobra Kai(2018-). Bruna Marquezine is outstanding as Jenny Kord. Becky G is effective as the voice of Khaji-Da. Susan Sarandon is fantastic as Victoria Kord. Belissa Escobedo is amazing as Milagro Reyes. George Lopez is hysterical as Rudy Reyes. Raoul Max Trujillo is awesome as Carapax. Damian Alcazar, Adriana Barraza &amp; Elpidia Carrillo are excellent as Alberto Reyes, Nana Reyes &amp; Rocio Reyes, respectively. Harvey Guillen is brilliant as Dr. Sanchez. Blue Beetle is a must watch (preferably in IMAX), for Blue Beetle &amp; Xolo Mariduena fans. I'm so glad that James Gunn has decided to include Jaime, in his new DC Universe. Can't wait for future team-ups &amp; sequels!",10
" A very generic superhero movie that can hopefully bounce back
","This is a very generic superhero movie. The plot is so basic, predictable and audiences have seen this story many times before. None of the characters stand out. The acting wasn't very convincing from a majority of the cast. The dialogue is poorly written. The chemistry between the main character and the love interest isn't fully developed and is very rushed. The humor in the movie feels forced many times. Personally I didn't care for the family dynamic in this film although it was a major part of the story.<br><br>Blue Beetle is well designed and has a cool looking costume. His powers are interesting and the special affects were good. The fights were just okay. So much more could have been done with this film and this character.",3
" So bad I walked out of the theater, don't spend money on this.
","I'm a DC fan. I love the early movies that came out of this current DC UNIVERSE such as Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, I even enjoyed Justice League. But Blue Beetle is just straight up boring. There is zero character development, no purpose to the characters and the MC's family just won't shut up.<br><br>The movie puts a lot of emphasis on family and love, which is all dandy, but it really doesn't work when the family is just outright annoying.<br><br>Plot wise it's just as disappointing. Sure it's a superhero movie, but did the writers really believe that the audience would buy the fact that a loser uncle in the family just so happens to be able to operate a high tech flying aircraft just because? There are too many plot holes that are too illogical to ignore and I do no recommend you find out.<br><br>Overall an extremely disappointing end to the current DC UNIVERSE. I wish we got a Man of Steel 2 instead of this garbage.<br><br>I'd recommend everybody to stay away unless you can watch it for free.",2
" CATWOMAN 2023
","Furious that this mess of a film went beyond the terrible script into production let alone releasing it. Especially considering they were able to bin the entire Batgirl film. Blue Beetle should have been scrapped before release. It's a terrible film.<br><br>There are so many plot holes, that compact over and over again it's exhausting to even unravel. Blue Beetle is such a terrible character in the comics and now onscreen. The OMAC angle is such a tried motif. Yet it's needed because how else can you find a villain strong enough to challenge what is essential and invincible, indestructible scarab armour.<br><br>Truly it's like watching Halle Berry's Catwoman with poor Susanne Sarandon playing the same lame character Sharon Stone played in said film. The whole thing is nauseating.<br><br>This should have been produced as an animation and even then it would have been at least a desperate filler for 10 year olds on a plane ride.",3
" Blue Beetle Flies High, While Remaining Grounded
","Blue Beetle comes at a time where Multiverses are breaking and worlds are ending, but it stays in its own corner and maintains a strong, grounded story with family at the center. The entire main cast are the heart of this film and the hispanic family dynamic feels so real and distinct. I found myself deeply connected to their story and invested in their emotional moments as if I were joining them on the journey as well. While it can be said that the rest of the story feels very repetitive from previous superhero films, that would be the biggest fault of the film. The action, emotion, and unique style leave a very memorable mark on the current state of superhero film. Had this been released 15 years ago, it could've been as big of a hit as any MCU standalone film, as it shares the same quality of the likes of Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Captain America. With the way superhero films have been, this is a breath of fresh air, even with the familiar taste.",8
" Long Winded Drag
","If I was James Gunn, I would have played the smart move and waited until I actually saw this film in theatres before confirming it was going to be the start of my new universe. When you announce a reboot, it should start strong and be memorable like Iron Man was for Marvel. But this is no Iron Man. This is nothing new, exciting or even interesting. It's the same as every Marvel movie nowadays - another churned out repeat and rehash of what already exists. This offers nothing new to the superhero genre, no exciting action, no unique sequences, just very generic stuff. There's nothing wrong with having a stereotypical superhero film, but it actually has to have a decent plot, engaging characters and decent writing to reach that level, which this doesn't.<br><br>Let's start with the obvious thing for me - the writing. The writing is TERRIBLE. What we get instead of clever dialogue that works is just dumb lines that you'd expect to hear in a cheap power rangers movie. Lines such as 'WHAT THE HECK' or 'WHAT THE...' 'WHAT THE HELL' 'GET OFF OF ME' are repeated a thousand billion times throughout this movie - as if the characters can't use their clever brains to react in different ways to situations. The result of this is a silly cartoonish film that offers no emotional depth, no real strong character elements and no interesting scenes. I'll provide a couple of examples where this happens.<br><br>Firstly, when Jamie has been caught in a trap and the villain is stomping towards him, all he can think to say is 'LET ME GO YOU PSYCHO' at the top of his lungs. Like, really? You should know as you're writing this garbage that people wouldn't react like that in real life. They're not gonna scream let me go because they know that isn't going to get them anywhere, and they certainly wouldn't call the guy about to kill them a psycho as it would just anger them more. It's just so cheesy and cringe it isn't needed. Either cut the dialogue out completely, or use something else. Maybe say instead 'please just let my family go'. That would have made him more of a hero and interesting character as his family would have been more important to him in that scenario, which we would engage with and like him more for. But instead, he acts selfish and thinks about himself first? Not really the way to make us like a character.<br><br>My second example is at the end, when the new girlfriend says 'I need to go'. When Jamie asks where, she says 'I'm gonna go back to my mums and look at her beautiful paintings'. Wow. That's the worst cringiest line I've ever heard. It just isn't needed! Writers need to learn when less is more. Focus on the emotion in that scene instead, which was important since it was the moment they finally kiss, which you spend the whole movie waiting for. GET IT OVER WITH ALREADY!<br><br>So, there's that. My next issue is the acting. It's not good. Everyone is overacting in this movie. All Jamie seems to do in tense situations is scream at the top of his lungs and it just becomes annoying. And I'm not kidding. He screeches. I have no problem with it happening once in a tense moment if he's angry, but it's overdone and overused. It's as if the director thinks it has more emotional impact but it doesn't. You either end up laughing at it or you just roll your eyes because you know they can't think of another clever way to express his emotions in that scene. The other noticeable one for me was the woman villain (can't remember her name). Nothing about her performance was striking other than her exaggeration on every line. It just feels like a cheap movie, again, like a power rangers film. That's the vibe it has for me.<br><br>Next is the pacing. The first half is ok, with some entertaining laughs (Uncle Rudy manages to salvage something in this film which is simply the humour) but from the middle onwards it really begins to drag. The action pieces aren't visually striking or interesting. The choices in direction are questionable most the time. But in the last third of the movie I'd say you really start to feel it. The exhaustion of the film and waiting for it to end. I could have walked out, but I chose to see it through. Wouldn't have missed much to be honest. Also the villains backstory is rushed through a single montage at the end in a really odd place so they could have used the rest of the screen time to portray that. It seems that the movie just seems to focus on several conversations instead of keeping the story flowing. It's like every 5 minutes someone will have a deep meaningful conversation with the main character. Uh, boring and cliche. Keep me engaged and interested cause if not I'll just switch off. Disney did Spider-Man Homecoming way better and I felt this should have had a similar vibe.<br><br>Overall, nothing much to see here. A very generic, dull and uninteresting basic plot with nothing much going for it. Not even the main character is interesting enough to keep you engaged.<br><br>If I was James Gunn, this would have been confirmed as the last of the old DC universe. But here we are. The bar has been set. How disappointing. I hope that James learns from this and changes the direction on future films with Blue Beetle, cause the director on this done a terrible job.",3
" What did I just watch?
","Here's the thing, im Mexican. It's obvious this film had Mexican influences throughout. Unfortunately, most people who aren't Mexican won't understand a bunch of stuff that is said or referenced. Not a good combination when you are trying to get 72 million trump voters to the theatres. The writing was poor, the dialogue hurt my ears. It wasn't funny. Not in English or Spanish. The two young lead actors were not very convincing or good. Xolo is fine in made for tv shows like karate kid but not ready for the big time. The girl was just cringeworthy. George Lopez was annoying and tried too hard to be funny. But then that's always been his MO. Movie reminded me alot if The Green Lantern just a lot more boring. The family house gets devastated but the cops are no where to be seen. People crying without a tear to be found. I fell asleep half way through it. Watch something else. Anything else.",3
" Cringey acting/dialogues, could've been better
","Never written any review but I just had to for this one. I felt asleep halfway through the movie in cinema. First of all, actors are poorly casted especially blue beetle himself, from start to end his acting cringed me to the bone. Everyone else speaks like train, even when those scenes where you're supposed to have deeper emotions, to empathise with the characters' stories and feelings...but all of them speak without much emotions and pauses like they never process some feelings first before they speak/act. I wanted to see actions from protagonist but this film decided to go with family troop kind of avengers fighting they way out instead. This feels like a combination of spider man and hulk, but the plot is below average IMO. Was expecting a better performance from Susan Sarandon well at least she's the only one I know from the entire movie but her villain evil side wasn't played out well. Don't waste your time unless you just need to watch a movie to kill time.",2
" The best DCEU film of recent yeas, but the bar has been set low.
","What was once known as the DCEU (the DC Comics Extended Universe) is rapidly coming to an end, and for most fans it is definitely with a whimper. Its fate was sealed earlier this year when Warner Brothers announced that director James Gunn had been hired to reboot the entire DC superhero line starting with a new Superman film due to be released in 2025. The remaining projects were pretty much up the creek as far as fans were concerned, as they essentially represented a dead end universe. One of the those films was the big screen debut of the Jamie Reyes's incarnation of the Blue Beetle, a super hero whose roots go back a long way to Charlton comics, and whose suit has been worn by more than one hero.<br><br>So, separating BLUE BEETLE from all the bad vibes surrounding it, is the film any good? For me, it is a qualified ""yes,"" starting with the basic plot, which is a pretty rote by the numbers superhero origin story. A piece of alien tech in the form of a scarab, which, naturally is coveted by a weapons manufacturing corporation, bonds with a recent college graduate named Jamie Reyes, forming a symbiotic relationship and giving him a suit of armor that bestows Jamie with some pretty awesome, though ill defined, powers. He's basically a Green Lantern, except he's Blue, and he's not part of any corp. The first third of the film sets up the circumstances of how the alien tech falls into the hero's hands; the middle section has him transform into the Blue Beetle and go through a learning curve with his powers; the finale has Jamie captured by the evil Kord Industries, who wants what he took from them back, but the challenge is overcome with the help of Jamie's family and new girlfriend. Any comic book fan will recognize the plot turns and character beats from any number of classic origin stories, be they DC or Marvel.<br><br>What gives BLUE BEETLE some juice and sets it apart from some other recent DCEU and MCU films is that it really has a lot heart, and was clearly made by people who liked and respected the character, and was true to the core of what made him popular. Director Angel Manuel Soto and screen writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer have given the story a very distinct Latin flavor, and infused it with a POV from that culture, which gives it a certain energy which makes it stand apart. The main supporting cast consists of Jamie's loyal and loving extended family, which consists of his parents, sister, grand-mother, and a wacky uncle who has no filter. At times it feels as if the family scenes are right out of a sitcom, especially when George Lopez's Uncle Rudy says anything. And one might be forgiven for thinking that the loud and boisterous Latin family has become a real trope. Still, it's a different track for a super hero film and it works, and tropes are not necessarily bad when they are used with sincerity. Jamie's scenes with his family really are the best part of the film. It's diversity without it feeling like box-checking marketing. Another thing I liked was the absence of the kind of snarky humor that has invaded a lot of films over in the MCU (best example being THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER), this film has plenty of humor, and though not all of it works, it's not annoying, and not a deal breaker.<br><br>Which leaves a lot that is average at best, starting with the CGI, of which there is a lot of in this film, along with big helping of comic book logic-like when Uncle Rudy is just able to sit down and hack into one of Kord Industries computers just because he has ""skills."" The Big Bad of the film is Victoria Kord, played by Susan Sarandon, and she is not very good playing the kind of one dimensional CEO villain (another trope) that has been a part of popular culture for decades, especially since the Great Recession. Sarandon is given some very unsubtle and clunky dialogue designed to show just how rapaciously villainous she is, though Raoul Max Trujillo as her main enforcer, Carapax, manages to project some Danny Trejo in his prime menace. There are the usual shallow jabs at capitalism and colonialism that are worked into every comic book film these days. And there are a few moments that made my eyes roll, as when the grand-mother, played by Adriana Barraza, wields a machine gun as if she was Jesse Ventura in PREDATOR. The scene where Xolo Mariduena's Jamie transforms feels like it was lifted right out of VENOM, and when we are shown how his armor works from his POV, it resembles similar scenes from IRON MAN.<br><br>I do wonder if the character of Blue Beetle would have been better if introduced in something like a YOUNG JUSTICE film, though there is little chance that a project like that would be green lighted as Warner Brothers these days. I do agree with those who have suggested that BLUE BEETLE probably would have been a blockbuster if it had been made a decade ago before its type of superhero story had been run into the ground. James Gunn has said the character will be part of his DCU going forward and that is certainly possible as Superman, Batman, and The Flash are mentioned in passing, thus firmly establishing that Jamie Reyes exists in a DC Universe, maybe one that is yet to be defined. I definitely think the film benefited by not having any other DC heroes make fan service cameos-there is a mid-credits scene, but it concerns a plot thread that is firmly set inside the Blue Beetle story canon.<br><br>All in all, I think BLUE BEETLE has a tighter story than THE FLASH, a much firmer grip on its title hero than BLACK ADAM, and it has to be way better than SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, which I didn't bother to see. If it the better DC super hero film of the last few years, than that is only because the bar has been set low. Still, Xolo Mariduena's Jamie Reyes, and his alter ego, deserves another shot no matter what the final fate of this film may be.",7

Pissed since she wants to incorporate the tech into battle suits of her own, Sarandon sends out her henchman, Raoul Trujillo (who I remember from Scanners II) to take Mariduena down using any means to his disposal, even going after his family, which results in tragic consequences.

" A Promising Start At The New DC Superhero With Old Ideas.
","Blue Beetle (2023) :
Movie Review -<br><br>Blue Beetle Review: DC Studios latest superhero drama, Blue Beetle, marks Ángel Manuel Soto's debut in the superhero genre. DC has been looking to turn the tide for a while and has had a few impressive successes recently, especially with Joker and The Batman. Blue Beetle is fresh stuff, alright, but does it really matter if superhero theories are old? A new suite and powers are enough? I guess Not. It's not just DC; Marvel too is suffering from an insufficiency of new conflicts and thrills. It's just that earlier we used to get one or two superhero movies a year; now we get a lot of them, and that too after watching so much stuff already. Blue Beetle is funny with Mexican humour-that's new! The suit, theme, and powers are also quite new. Though the film lacks newness in storytelling. We all know how one gets power and tries to use it while tackling dangers, doing romance, and saving family. Blue Beetle is that mixture again, with some tech talk we have been seeing from Iron Man, Wayne, and Hulk for years. Nevertheless, it's a promising start for a new superhero, if that's what you're looking for.<br><br>The film begins with Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returning home after graduation, and he learns that his family is gonna lose the house in Palmera City. He is fired from a job by Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) while trying to save Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine) amidst an argument. Jenny might have a job for him, and he visits Kord's office to meet her. Jenny gives him a Scarab to protect, which is childishly opened by his family. Jaime is now chosen to become a symbiotic host to the Scarab, an ancient alien biotechnological relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armour, turning him into the superhero ""Blue Beetle"". Victoria and her bodyguard robot, Conrad (Raoul Max Trujillo) are after the code of Blue Beetle, which jointly puts Jaime's family in danger. Jaime and Kha-Ji must work together to protect the family and the code, but will it be enough?<br><br>Coming as a fresh film, Blue Beetle has no load of expectations. So even if it's underwhelming at parts, it still doesn't bother you much. It can't be the same when you watch The Batman or Superman movies because they are hugely popular superheroes and their films come with certain baggage. The screenplay of Blue Beetle is the main concern, as it deals with new ideas in old ways. It's 2023, and we are still being fed two decades-old conflicts. Why? The building collapses, but the Hero wouldn't be hurt, or even the heroine, even if there is large destruction right around her. One of the family members must get hurt so that the Hero can get angry and unleash his powers. In no time, the hero and heroine would come close to kissing each other, and someone would enter the room. Don't you dare ask when they fell in love. It's just there. Don't tell me you haven't been familiar with all these things, because if you are not, Blue Beetle is going to feed all of them for the first time. But if you have tasted them before, then this might get you away from the table in no time.<br><br>The handsome Xolo Maridueña will be the girls favourite soon, at least as a crush. He has that personality and kindness in his natural role as Jaime Reyes. But as Blue Beetle, he is still immature. That's what the course of his character demands, by the way. Raoul Max Trujillo has been pretty impressive as the antagonist here. He might have only a few scenes to show his face and act, but he is damn good there. The female baddie played by Susan Sarandon didn't look evil at all, but you know why. It's just that female touch that makes things difficult for her. Jaime's love interest, Bruna Marquezine, is cute but nothing that can be remembered or even discussed. Surprisingly, all the family members of Jaime seem to have a blast. Damián Alcázar, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, and Belissa Escobedo have rocked more as a unit than as individuals. Harvey Guillén's Sanchez goes unnoticed until before the last lines, when he speaks in Mexican.<br><br>Talking about the visual effects, Blue Beetle is your old laser show put together with high-tech weapons. Some of the destruction scenes look grand on the big screen without any 3D effects. The cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski is fine, whereas Craig Alpert's edit keeps the crispness intact. Technically, it's a well-made film, no doubt, considering the $120 million budget. The studio took good care of the production design, as nothing really looked outdated or ugly here. However, Blue Beetle needed a little brainstorming on the paper, which is clearly missing. Of course, you don't expect a typical superhero entertainer to be a smart and intelligent film, but what's wrong with being a bit more clever? Ángel Manuel Soto's storytelling is well-versed in your regular superhero flicks that you have been enjoying over the years. He makes you a simple popcorn entertainer when the world is getting more advanced with multiverses and emotionally powerful tales. Could he have done better? Yes, I guess so. Blue Beetle isn't a bad film at all, but it isn't great enough to be recommended. It's just a matter of your expectations, whether you want to go for it desperately or not. But yes, it can be viewed once for a fresh attempt in the money-spinning genre.<br><br>RATING - 5/10*",5
" Cliche movie that adds nothing to the genre
","To summarize the movie in one sentence: an action movie with a linear cliche story line, mediocre acting, below average CGI and made mostly to appeal to younger teenage audiences.<br><br>Now, if you go in expecting the above then the movie rating would be 6 and if you are going in expecting a super hero movie in the likes of Marvel then you will rate this 1.<br><br>What annoyed me the most is the exaggerated fiction and story line. This felt at a lot of times like watching cartoons where just drawing the scene makes it possible to do in real.<br><br>Another annoying factor is most of the movie is in Spanish so it requires extra effort to follow through with the dialogue.<br><br>Here is the rating of:<br><br>Storyline: 2/5. Very cliche, linear and expected outcome. Moreover, the editing should have been done better as you notice there are many gaps between the scenes in the movie.<br><br>CGI: 2/5. You would expect really good CGI in an action super hero movie but this isn't the case here. That's not coming as a surprise from DC comics and they could learn a thing or two from Marvel. Even when special effects were used on the helmet of ""blue beetle"" when it was half broken in the fighting scene, the helmet looked so cheap just like a toy for kids and reminded me of the old kids shows we used to see in the 90s on tv.<br><br>Acting: 3/5. The reason why I put 3 is due to the good acting of the supporting cast mainly George Lopez and Adriana Barazza. The main actor Xolo delivers an underwhelming performance and lacks the ability to connect with the audience. My biggest disappointment was the horrible writing made for the lovely and amazing legendary actress Susan Sarandon, she deserves roles that are much better than this and movies on a different league. I hope she doesn't take such similar roles in the future.",4
" Like a cheap spiderman
","In a nutshell, this felt like a cheap Spiderman variation film,, the humour was silly the action was same old same old. CGI was pretty good, but there was nothing original about it.<br><br>Long before the film ended, I was looking at my watch hoping the end would arrive sooner than later and put me out of my misery.<br><br>The one thing DC often has over marvel, is the darker theme, but this film felt much more like a light hearted marvel film that just failed on all fronts.<br><br>I love science fiction films and was really hoping this could have been a solid DC title, but there's no way we'll see another Blue Beetle film
Will be forgotten very quickly.",3
" One of the worst Superhero Movies I've seen
","One of the worst Superhero Movies I've seen, With a superhero who not only doesn't deserve the superpowers he's been given, He also doesn't want to be a superhero at all. The script from start to finish<br><br>is terrible and tries to imitate other Superhero Movies, The family of the ""Hero"" is stupid, loud and completely irresponsible, And we could already see it in the part where they not only pressed him to open<br><br>the box but also played with the alien object and threw it to each other. The worst character in the movie besides Jaime himself, Who only God knows why he was chosen as the host by the Beetle, Is his<br><br>sister Milagro who has no sense of responsibility, Maturity or logic, And made all the possible mistakes. Not to mention the villain who is one of the worst villains I have ever seen, Although the pacifist<br><br>""Hero"" who is afraid to hurt the villain, And constantly apologizes like a girl with cuckoos for fighting him, Is no less worse than him. And we haven't even talked about the dialogues and the unfunny jokes<br><br>throughout the film, Which I stopped dozens of times due to nervousness about the script .<br><br>In short, This is a bad movie and a waste of more than two hours of time. Believe me, There are much more interesting and important things you can do with this wasted time instead of watching this bad<br><br>movie, Which I have no idea how it got such a high rating relative to what it's really worth.",2
" Mid Superhero Movie. Don't go in expecting Iron Man level movie.
","The budget appears to be very small for this movie. For being a movie, it fails to reach the level of most Marvel TV shows.<br><br>Plot is mediocre. The family is the best part but the execution of the plot is cookie cutter and actually does grow stale by the end.<br><br>Acting is mediocre. Imagine watching each scene and knowing there should have been another take. I'm not kidding, thats how see through the acting is unfortunately.<br><br>CGI is mediocre. Imagine the POV lens of Blue Beetle having Nintendo 64 graphics. That's what it looks like.<br><br>The reason why I am giving it a 5 is because although it was not great, it was not terrible. This movie barely floats above the surface. DC has to do a lot more to get fans excited for the future.",5
" Had potential, but excess of humor downed it
","I liked Xolo as the Beetle. The actual Beetle parts were good. Not the usual soundtrack for DC movies, but a good one. I also liked the connection with the ""original"" beetle.<br><br>Sadly the whole ""Latin humor"" was too much, and the ""familia"" stuff was distracting and exaggerated. As a Mexican, I understood all the references, and there were several moments I laughed at the jokes, but got to the point it was just plain ridiculous. Also, the whole thing of the ""abuela"" acting as a ""revolutionary"" it's very anachronistic and grotesque.<br><br>I like the idea of a ""Hispanic"" hero in the DC Comics universe , but I hope they realize they over did it.<br><br>Yes the Beetle character in the comics was funny, yes the funny gist worked with Shazam, but in this movie it just went too far. If this is how the Gunn universe is starting... I am not very excited about it.",6
" Better than expected, but could have been better
","So with the superhero genre turning out quite a bit of disappointment, my expectations weren't high going into this. While it was better than I expected, they could have made it great, and set it apart from every other superhero story. The family dynamic was good, but there's a lot of corny jokes, just like every coming of age superhero movie. They could have made it more serious and dramatic. They should have explored the suits abilities more. They could have made a better villain. They could have tried something other than the same old ""going up against someone with similar powers but they are evil/brainwashed"" trope. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, but it's definitely not going to change any minds about the genre.",6
" Unoriginal, but fun
","Definitely feels recycled at certain parts and the plot is very predictable. Susan Sarandon doesn't work as the main villain for me, and there are some cringy moments (specifically with the Grandmother). However, it is a fun time with great action, decent humor, and a lot of heart. The visual effects look good for the most part, Xolo's performance is a highlight, and the Latino representation is a breath of fresh air. I consider this a W for DC given their recent movies.<br><br>Overall, it won't show you anything you haven't seen before, but it's an enjoyable film and worth your time if you're into these types of movies.",6
" Please do not believe the good reviews
","Cringiest movie I've seen. Don't believe the good reviews, I was literally mad at myself for watching it and I couldn't stop looking at my watch. The Flash was miles better &amp; I 100% fear the new DCU.<br><br>This movie is for kids and is a disgrace to older viewers. Nobody in the theater laughed at the corny jokes and I couldn't care less about any of the cringe and annoying characters.

" Probably the best movie DC will release this year
","Blue Beetle is directed by Angel Manuel Soto and stars Xolo Maridueña, Bruna Marquezine, Damian Alcazar, Adriana Barraza, George Lopez, Becky G and Susan Sarandon.<br><br>This will probably go down as the best DC movie to release this year unless Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom manages to blow everyone out of the water (pun intended) when it releases in December. (Doubtful.) In a movie that was originally supposed to go to HBO Max but WB had enough faith in this to give this a theatrical release, Blue Beetle now finds itself as the Penultimate DCEU movie while also simultaneously being the start of Gunn's DC universe apparently?<br><br>Despite Xolo Maridueña giving a great charismatic performance here as the lead and overall liking parts of this I unfortunately didn't like this as much as I wanted too. There's nothing new, surprising or exceptional about Blue Beetle's plot. Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer's screenplay goes through a checklist of clichés that you've seen in nearly every superhero movie before. An ordinary young man suddenly gains superpowers and turns into a superhero? Check! A villain searches for a MacGuffin that the superhero has? Check! The superhero has a potential love interest? Check! The superhero learns about the meaning of family? Check! And the list goes on. Blue Beetle does have some thrills but they felt sporadic at least for me. There are some things this movie does succeed in which is the comedy which did work for me and was effective throughout. In terms of performances I did think Adriana Barraza was a good scene stealer here. Even though the storyline between them is predictable and you could see things coming a mile away I did also think Xolo Maridueña and Bruna Marquezine had good chemistry with each other. Susan Sarandon gives a villain performance that ranges from campy to mediocre I think this movie would've benefited if she went full camp though.<br><br>Don't go into this expecting the next Across The Spider-Verse or Guardians Vol 3 because this definitely isn't on that level but it is fairly engaging with good cast chemistry and a good central performance from Xolo Maridueña. Unfortunately this just felt too middle of the road to me. Maybe I'm being overly cynical, maybe I do have comic book movie fatigue, maybe I'm just tired of mediocrity in mainstream Hollywood blockbusters as of late. Or maybe it's just a mix of all three. This is a step in the right direction but the DC brand is just severely damaged at this point. Gunn certainly has his work cut out for him.<br><br>The last two comic book movies to release this year, The Marvels and Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom also have an uphill battle against them. I don't have plans to watch either but maybe curiosity will get the best of me.",6

" A WIN FOR THE MEXICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY
","Reading through these reviews I can tell they're completely missing the point of this movie.. Is this another superhero movie where the main character gets super powers through an alien artifact? Yes. But it goes BEYOND that. All superhero movies value romance and somewhat family but Blue Beetle does it justice when they talk about family.<br><br>Being Mexican-American myself and growing up in white America this story touched my heart. I saw myself and my family in these characters and our struggles being put up on the big screen. Many people fail to realize that the Mexican community lived for the American dream. Our parents, and grandparents picked up everything they had on their shoulders and left their homes behind in order to find a better life for themselves and their children. Nowadays, the world is fastly changing under our feet and as the rich become richer, we get pushed out as the movie shows.<br><br>This story is important for representation to our community. It's filled with comedic monologues and objects our community values. We as a Latino community value family over everything, especially living in the U. S. as long as we got family, we can always figure it out. I loved how they tackled the romance, it's not overly pushed in your face, it's gentle and natural how it grows throughout the film.<br><br>Lastly, the cast was outstanding their dynamic was well put together. Their chemistry was amazing everyone represented an important role and performed great.<br><br>As my title says this is a win for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans living in the U. S. Its a great film when you better understand who this movie was made for. This is an amazing movie for the whole family, give it a chance!!",10
" Que lastima
","As a middle-aged Latino, I went in wanting Blue Beetle to work, perhaps launching a series built around a strong Latino hero and his family. Alas, it's really bad. There are some cheap laughs and ok action. Ultimately, the story takes too long to unfold, relies on an overly-bad ""bad guy,"" and, at times, laughs at rather than with Latino culture. It's unfortunate since the character has a rich history and this rebirth could have been interesting. Kids under 8 or 9 will appreciate it, especially the bits of potty and fart humor, but the film wastes good talent and seends the Blue Beetle character back to the file cabinet where it previously languished. Too bad.",4
" One of the worst superheroes movies
","The 3 stars that I gave are entirely for the Blue Beetle suit and power concept. Plotwise, it's so so so terrible, cliche, and cringey. I could predict almost everything, this movie seems like a copy of Shang-Chi, even the jokes 🙄.<br><br>The main character is so dumb, stupid, and cringey, he could've used the power to his advantage, but even with power, he still looks like powerless dude who needs constant helps from ordinary people, when others kill his family ruthlessly, he still couldn't muster up courage to kill the enemy, he's a stupid and cringey coward.<br><br>The side characters are also cliche and cringey. He just has that one family member who constantly looka for troubles.<br><br>The villains are right up super cringey. Nothing is new except for power concept (it's actually nothing surprising but looks kinda cool), the writing is just down right bad. The shooting itself is also SMH, as always, DC movies are always shot without lights, and it's hard to watch for some parts(especially the part they fight in the air).<br><br>It could be a somewhat acceptable movie if it was released over 10 years ago, but I doubt the writer could make it good, after all, he still copied from other movies now.",3
" Generic Comic Book Movie Trash
","Blue Beetle is such a boring, generic comic book movie. You could predict half the lines before they were said (only couldn't do the other half because it was in Spanish). Generic villain whose evil for essentially no reason. Generic family makes you stronger theme. Generic going to the plains of death and being told ""its not your time yet"". Generic superhero fighting an evil version of himself (Reverse Flash, Yellowjacket, Venom Spider-man, Iron Monger, Abomination etc). Generic comic book movie attempt at humour (wow, they're about to kiss and someone walks into the room, making it awkward, hilarious).<br><br>Change the character names on the script and you've seen this movie countless times.",5
" ""Down with the Imperialists!""
","A very traditional origin movie, in other words nothing original -- it's basically a big pot stew of the Shazam family, uncle Ben, Shuri, and Fast&amp;Furious. The entire exposition is filled with scripted dialogues, stiff performances, and cliche development, to the point where the film kinda invites you to nap the first 30 minutes. However, I do appreciate Blue Beetle for respecting the 2 crucial components of any superhero movie: suit up and first flight, as both segments are visibly budgeted. Another thing worthy of compliment are the action sequences, which are well-choreographed, of considerable lengths, although all heavily CGIed. Everything else, including but not limiting to romance, backstories, comedy, antagonists, are just plainly average. Better luck next year DC, hopefully James Gunn will get things back on track soon.",6

" An Iron Man Ripoff
","Throughout the whole movie I just felt like I was watching an Iron Man ripoff. Yes, the story was different. Yes, it's called ""Blue Beetle"". But that was about the only difference from Blue Beetle (2023) and Iron Man (2008).<br><br>So the plot is that an alien scarab chooses a college student, Jaime Reyes, to be its host and in turn giving the teenager a suit of armour that is designed to protect its host and has unpredictable powers. But the original creator of the scarab, Victoria Kord, wants it back and will do anything to do so.<br><br>The trailer and the plot seemed promising going into it but that ""promising"" start quickly vanished after the plot seemed to follow the 2008 Iron Man movie.<br><br>However, aside from it being a close Iron Man (2008) clone, it was an enjoyable superhero action movie.<br><br>The characters were very likeable and a few comedic moments were sprinkled throughout.<br><br>Overall, if you like a superhero action movie and don't mind too much that it's like Iron Man (2008) then you'll like this movie.<br><br>I rate Blue Beetle (2023) a 6/10 purely because of how much of a clone it is from Iron Man (2008) but it redeems itself in being an enjoyable watch.",6
" He's a superhero, whether he likes it or not
","I know enough about the Blue Beetle character from the comics to understand his origin in the movie, like who the character Jaime Reyes is and what the scarab that is the Blue Beetle suit; being interested in that they made a movie on the character. The DC movie Blue Beetle (2023) was fun and entertaining to watch, though it can be by the numbers when it comes to main antagonists, the main character and the actor playing the main character is what makes the me worth watching. Plus, along with the rest of the cast the movie is funny and like the comics it is based on.<br><br>Actor Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle was great as the character; he was likable, funny, and you root for him either going up against the main villain or dealing with money problems/finding a job after graduating from a university. The rest of Jaime Reyes's family was funny, played by great actors, and I liked how Jaime Reyes and his family worked together to deal with any problem that gets in their way; one of the family members that were especially funny was George Lopez as Jaime Reyes's uncle Rudy Reyes. Working with Jaime Reyes to keep the scarab away from the villain is Jenny Kord played by Bruna Marquezine who is the daughter of Ted Kord (the second Blue Beetle); I also thought she did a decent job and worked well with Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle.<br><br>One of the antagonists is Victoria Kord played by Susan Sarandon who is good in the movie, but she is a standard villain who wants the scarab for some sort of super soldier army she is creating because she runs Ted Kord's company because she is his sister. The other antagonist that works with Victoria Kord is Carapax played by Raoul Max Trujillo who is this super soldier she tested on and uses him to fight Blue Beetle, this character does have a backstory of some kind that is revealed at one point, so you know how he got like his now. The villains could have been better, but around that the movie can be entertaining with its action scenes, references to the comics, and a main character you like following.<br><br>The Blue Beetle scarab looked cool, and I love that the suit is an actual practical effects suit with added CGI that blends very well making it cool to watch in the action sequences that are well done. The action scenes were nicely shot, with it not having a lot of cuts but instead having nice long shots where you can see the actor doing the stunts. The movie has stuff from the comics that people will notice if they know the comics, and the family aspect to the movie was enjoyable to watch, along with this being the first Mexican superhero that does a respectable job representing the culture and how Jaime Reyes and his family interact in their own way which was cool to see in this DC movie.<br><br>Blue Beetle (2023) was a fun DC movie that I would recommend watching even if you do not know much about the character and comic books he comes from; though the antagonists and the plot might seem like something we have seen before, but Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle played by Xolo Maridueña makes the movie worth watching because he is a likable character. The movie was funny, it had good performances from the actors, great action, nice cinematography, and great effects on the scarab and Blue Beetle suit when using the many weapons that it can create making it entertaining; I would give this a watch when you can.",7
" No More Blind Dates

" Finally DC got something right
",Over the years DC has dropped the ball on so many flimsy and I don't know if that is because WB gets involved or if there are too many hands in the pot but FINALLY they got one right. Blue bettle is superbly done. Amazing visuals and the cast has so much chemistry. Xolo does an outstanding job in the lead role and you would think the kid has been in dozens of movies. The poly is straight forward and easy enough to follow or at least connect the dots. The light hoarded comedy glades back to other films but so many jokes stand on it own so there is no comparison. This is the flim DC got right since Aquaman. This is the film James Gunn should center around. A simply amazing movie even if you are not familiar with Blue Bettle you can still walk in and pick up the story and character but for the hardcore fans there are plenty of throwback references to catch throughout the film. Overall the rating should be a lot higher as this is a great family movie.,9

But that's not it, it's not an interesting story, the characters are forgettable and like The Flash before it, it's boring.

" Cliché after cliché
","I was excited to watch the movie after I saw the trailer. It promised to be good. Then...is this trying to be an homage to Mexican Americans? Trying to be do for Latino's what others did for the Asian community? It looks the movie is written by Chatgpt, with too much over the top Mexican clichés. I'm not Mexican but I'm what people like to classify as Latino based on my place of birth, and I felt that this movie tries to put all Latino's clichés on the same box. Everything is predictable, and the story is just childish. I could give it 1 for rating, but I don't want to be too mean. Susan Sarandon is the white token on this movie, which I also feel bad for having such a great actress doing such a bad role. I feel that, if the writers were not so focused on trying to make the film so Mexican American, the movie could have gone on a different and better direction. It doesn't connect the dots. Here is the take away of the movie: Mexican American are hard workers who are treated as secondary citizens, no matter how well educated they are. Family is the most important thing to them, they always have a crazy uncle that does stupid things but they are always there for the family. Oh, granny's are bad ass when it comes to protecting the family. Bottom line, its a movie for American Mexicans. The question is, do they feel it's a good movie for them? The FXs are great though...",4
" It's not bad, it's worthless.
","A mixture of Shazam, Venom, Iron Man and Taika Waititi jokes. Trying to copy all the good elements from other Superhero movies, doesn't make it a good movie (as illustrated). The cast is peeked just because their heritage and they also fail at getting anywhere near in being funny, because they try too hard. Comedy is natural and even adding George Lopez to the mix, can't save this disaster of bad jokes. They are not even bad enough to be considered funny. Other than that, photography is a copy from the Iron Man usages of light and cameras, music is mediocre and the scenario plot is at least plagiarized from other scenarios.",3
" Enjoyable but derivative and predictable
","Susan Sarandon is the latest big name to get a turn at playing an unconvincing baddie. Though I am a fan generally.<br><br>Seen a story similar to this lots of times. You could more or less plot the whole story after the first 10 minutes, the character traits and even the twist.<br><br>It was frustrating that there wasn't more information on the Beetle and its powers. It was sort of a given that it could do lots of fancy stuff without really explaining to us what it can do.<br><br>It is, of course, extremely far fetched not even close to realistic. Its CGI heavy, but also a little slower moving than I expected, and maybe less superhero stuff and more talking than usual.<br><br>There are two end credit scenes - surprises me that most people still walk out at the first ""end"" - even though the lights have not come on.<br><br>Overall its enjoyable enough, if unoriginal, a little long and a bit silly.",6
" Wasted potential
","The movie had potential, but DC squandered it by targeting a child audience, with cliché jokes, dire direction and a message about family love that has already been seen and heard..<br><br>If you want to see it, I recommend watching it with low expectations, or not too high. At no point does the movie manage to grab you/excite you with its drama or action scenes, and that's a pretty big flaw. I don't usually like superhero movies and this one could have been the exception, but DC failed to deliver.<br><br>What is worthwhile is the soundtrack, and the idea of the superhero was very good, a pity that it was wasted in this way.",5
" Kordy But Okay
","I had some bizarre reasons to see this, despite me favoring the DCEU over MCU: The Red-Headed Villain and the Hero's name hooked me.<br><br>No, not ""Blue Beetle."" ""Jaime."" I've never met a Jaime that wasn't gorgeous. Granted I only met three in my life. And despite only the character's name being Jaime, the actor continued that streak of mine. Also, I've always loved Susan Sarandon, especially when she's a redhead. So those two factors made me see this on opening weekend.<br><br>And if I knew Harvey Guillén was in this, I wouldn't have waited for the Sunday of this film's premiere. He's my absolute favorite part of the ""What We Do in the Shadows"" series.<br><br>Unfortunately, the movie is just okay. I literally stopped counting how many other superhero movies this took from. Iron Man, Venom, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Batman, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Green Lantern and on and on. I'm sure I missed a dozen more. I know this is an established DC character (I had bought one of the comics in my youth) and not fully stealing from those ideas, but it was hard to see this as a standalone origin story with all that baggage.<br><br>So, Jaime Reyes (you will hear this name 100x more than Blue Beetle, so get used to it) is eager to get a job after graduating college, save his family from eviction and bang his job lead. Instead, Jaime Reyes becomes an alien scarab's host who turns him into the title's superhero to fight the evil Kord corporation.<br><br>This movie is also part-sitcom about a super tight Mexican family. There is a ton of slapstick and absolute live-action cartooning going on here. Despite there being an alien presence, you WILL have to suspend your disbelief multiple times, namely when the family can out of the Blue operate high tech gear/weapons in split-seconds for convenience.<br><br>Actually, this movie is chock-full of coincidences and conveniences. If you leave your brain at the door, you can just let these slide and, again, this really is a live-action cartoon.<br><br>For the positives, forevermore, I'll always love Susan Sarandon. So much so, I didn't even pay attention/critique her performance here. I just adore her no matter what she does. And I did like the dynamics and chemistry of the family. Doesn't hurt the title character is, indeed, very handsome and there were a few near-naked shots.<br><br>Bring on his Blue Beetles in an uncut version!<br><br>I would mildly recommend it. There isn't anything here groundbreaking, original, fresh or creative. And on the flipside, it's harmless, entertaining and aside from a few slow scenes, it mostly flew by.<br><br>Like The Flash, they set these both up for sequels that will never see the greenlight. Sucks for this cast and crew who probably thought there would be more while making this and they did put their hearts fully into this movie.<br><br>***<br><br>Final Thoughts: Updated DCEU ranking from Best to Trash with only one more to go...<br><br>1.

" Had low expectations but they passed
","The highlight of this film is its heart. To do that they made the whole family central to the movie which then made Jaime not feel so much like a main character despite having the suit. There were some big characters that happen to over shadow him. Nana Reyes was hilarious and the MVP alongside Rudy Reyes. So, it added and took away from the film, if that makes sense. I got a bit teary eyed I can admit. The mix of English and Spanish really drove the authenticity of the emotional scenes. They were centred around grief, loss and pain. They were few and they were impactful. Throwing some throw backs in to compliment the past Blue Beetles was pretty cool too.",6
" Promising
","Directed by Angel Manuel Soto, the story follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) as he searches to find purpose in the world after just graduated from college, but suddenly life throws a curve ball when he unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab chooses Jaime to be its host, he is bestowed with an incredible range of superpowers and weaponry.<br><br>I get it, resetting what is already a risky and messy cinematic universe is a risky move, especially since opening it by introducing a quite unpopular character for the wider audience. But man I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't enjoy this one, it's a fresh and solid start if not a great one. It's slick, fun, and packed with emotions, while this type of origin story isn't new in the superhero genre but there's something special about Blue Beetle's central plotline. It's about the power of family's love and support also acceptance of what destiny has given to us, sometimes it doesn't meet our expectations, and sometimes it's exceeded it more than we can imagine. We can see it from Jamie's character developed throughout the story, actually not just him but also his family. Life after college isn't what he's imagined, Jamie even said he failed the family and it just gets worse when the scarab chooses him. He couldn't grasp the reality of it at first, but he slowly embraced it, Jamie is destined to be their hero, to be bigger than he had hoped for.<br><br>I never see Maridueña's prior work, but he's certainly the right guy for the role. He delivers a joyful and honest performance, not to mention the rest of the cast who played the family, their chemistry natural and strong. George Lopez' Uncle Rudy is probably my second favorite, The dude is literally a comic relief. I'm not a big fan of the villains in this movie, there's nothing really special other than they play an important part in the story, obviously. I think they are sort of merely a threat, Susan Sarandon's performance isn't bad though. It's crazy that the CGI is way better and cleaner than The Flash, which has more budget than this movie. Both of the suits are practical but, once again, the Blue Beetle is definitely superior. The first suit-up looks terrifyingly awesome.<br><br>Blue Beetle is a promising start for the DCU.",8
" Was pleasantly surprised
","Another super hero movie... Yes but with a difference.<br><br>Different continent with a whole new character with a plot that mixes Iron Man with Venom which makes for an interesting story.<br><br>Our main lead 'Jaime Reyes' fresh from graduating from Uni finding himself in the world gets a pleasant surprise to say the least...<br><br>What's most evident from this movie is it's heart, family being a core value that drives the story leaving you feeling invested in the warm aspect of the movie.<br><br>Action is very good throughout, the set pieces are very good with a great supporting cast, an enjoyable watch that's worth a viewing.",7
" Was I entertained, not really!
","Where do I start... Ok, the movie has family values, includes Mexican culture and characters to the superhero rosta and the CGI was decent, BUT<br><br>The movie just didn't pull me in, it reminded me of a mash up of other superhero movies but worse.. the Hero didn't make me root for him and the baddies sucked at thier job too, no chrisma and lacking in the threatening department. The supporting people came over as either pointless or unbelievable.<br><br>Sadly, apart for a couple of not too bad action scenes, It was easily compared to a tv episode rather than a full blown DC movie.<br><br>This was Dcs version of the ms marvel series quality wise for me. 5 out of 10 tops.",5
" This was an excellent movie!
","Yeah, it was a fun movie. Very humorous and very family oriented. I'm familiar enough with this version of the blue beetle to be overjoyed with its presentation on the big screen.<br><br>This could not have gone any better, in fact it was design to be what it was, and it worked.<br><br>It's not an Epic they are trying to make a billion dollars off of. I'm sure that would be nice and all, but it was really good to see a movie in the DC Extended Universe that perfectly fit into that without the pressure of having to be epic.<br><br>It was a cool film that allowed itself to have fun and because of that I had so much fun watching it,
Worth seeing!!!",7
" A Disappointing Miss for DC
","The highly anticipated ""Blue Beetle"" arrived in theaters with the hope of revitalizing the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Regrettably, this superhero film fails to live up to expectations, making it difficult to see how it can contribute to the resurgence of DC on the big screen.<br><br>""Blue Beetle"" introduces us to Jaime Reyes, a young teenager who stumbles upon an alien scarab that grants him incredible powers. While the premise is intriguing, the execution falls flat.<br><br>The film's primary issue is its lackluster storytelling. The plot feels disjointed, and character development is minimal. As a result, viewers are given little reason to become emotionally invested in Jaime Reyes or his journey as the Blue Beetle. The potential depth and complexity that could have enriched this superhero origin story are disappointingly absent.<br><br>The action sequences, while occasionally entertaining, are hindered by mediocre CGI and uninspired choreography. Additionally, the absence of memorable villains further diminishes the film's impact, leaving audiences yearning for a more compelling antagonist to challenge our hero.<br><br>It's disheartening to witness DC struggling to find its place in the superhero film landscape, particularly when compared to the consistent success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ""Blue Beetle"" represented an opportunity to introduce an exciting new character to the DCEU, but it ultimately falls short.<br><br>While the film is not devoid of merits, such as some decent performances from the cast, it is evident that ""Blue Beetle"" lacks the depth and vision necessary to elevate DC's cinematic universe. In a time when superhero movies continue to dominate the box office, this underwhelming entry does little to advance DC's standing. One can only hope that future DC films will learn from the shortcomings of ""Blue Beetle"" and deliver the compelling storytelling and character development that fans crave.",1
" Not Very Good. Just Another Poorly Written Film
","This is the reason why noone cares about the writers on strike, The writing in many of todays films is terrible with all sorts of fashionable Hollywood tropes that I cant really talk about or this review will get flagged and pulled.<br><br>None of the actors are familiar in this one and the acting itself is not very good. The story is convoluted and disconnected but still manages to come across as the same generic super hero film as others that are not well done.<br><br>There is a love story that is stifled due to the protagonists immaturity and comedic attempts. The female in this love story and the supporting actress is absolutely stunning, so there is that positive note.. The superhero lives at home in a small house with a massive Mexican family all squeezed into the same place.<br><br>I could write more on how things are not good but I feel as though I have already had enough of this film and want to move on to something more engaging, Avoid this one.",5
" Blue Beetle Is The Hero DC Needs
","In the midst of the DC inside turmoil and the SAG-AFTRA, WGA strikes, Angel Manuel Soto had to promote the movie he directed without any of its actors, and after the great disappointment that The Flash was, Warner Brothers Discovery needed a good movie to lift themselves up, and they succeeded admirably.<br><br>Xolo Maridueña is perhaps better known as Miguel Diaz on Netflix's Cobra Kai, but he also excels at brining Jaime Reyes to life. Maridueña is a very charming and talented actor, who has proven he could lead an entire movie. His boy-ish naivete helps him melt into Jaime, a recent College Graduate that needs to find a job to support his family.<br><br>This job hunt leads Jaime into the Kord family war, but more specifically to Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine).<br><br>Jenny wants to prevent her aunt Victoria Kord from harnessing alien power in order to create indestructible and unbeatable mercenaries. That alien technology has been in their family for decades, and it is one that Jenny's father, Ted Kord studied most of his life until his disappearance.<br><br>The Scarab is a sentient being that once it chooses its host, it provides them with an exoskeleton that can withstand many attacks ad create whatever weapon the host can imagine.<br><br>But of course, what comic book movie would be complete without a villain? And this film has two.<br><br>The first one being Ignacio Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo), a Guatemalan soldier recruited as a child to fight communist in the area, and who also became the first test subject of the OMAC, which is a suit powered by the Scarab, and its name means One-Man Army Corps. Producing this in mass to the United States Government would be a great win for Kord Industries and its CEO, Victoria Kord.<br><br>Carapax however is not a one-note villain. We can see that he lost his mother due to civil unrest in Guatemala, and as mentioned before he was recruited as a child by the United States into becoming a weapon to fight communism. He is a tragic villain, one that you can feel sympathy for.<br><br>But the undisputable villain here is Victoria Kord. Played by the ever-amazing Susan Sarandon, Victoria is a woman with a vision.<br><br>Victoria and her father created Kord industries from the ground, they created a company that would manufacture weapons of mass destruction, and she would even go into countries affected by them to report on the success of their terrible merchandise.<br><br>But when her father passed away, he left the company to Victoria's brother, Ted Kord, which infuriated Victoria into a corporate takeover once Ted disappeared out of thin air, and having the Scarab in her hands would not only mean her father was wrong, but she would also stop at nothing to harness its powers, even if it means killing children or entire families ""for the greater good"".<br><br>Under less-capabale hands a character like Victoria Kord could have easily be cartoonish in a James Bond villan-esque kind of way, but Sarandon is amazingly scary in the role, which she does not allow to go into camp territory.<br><br>Blue Beetle has a great supporting cast in the Reyes family, with actors such as George Lopez, Damián Alcázar, Adriana Barraza, Elipidia Carrillo and Belissa Escobedo as Jaime's sister, Milagro.<br><br>Not only do I bring it up because they are amazing actors, but also because their presence makes the movie that much better.<br><br>This film is about a reluctant Latino hero who gets his strength from the love of his family, it is an emotional roller coaster from beginning to end, and as I mentioned at the beginning Xolo Mardueña is amazing on every scene he's in.<br><br>The director of Blue Beetle, Angel Manuel Soto has given DC fans the hero we need in these times of uncertainty. This was perhaps the absolute best comic book movie I have seen in years.",10

" The superhero film the genre needs right now
","Blue Beetle is the superhero movie the genre needs right now. In a sea of tired, CGI-filled cameo-fests that are only focused on building out their multiverses than telling a good story... Blue Beetle is a refreshing reminder of why we fell in love with comic book films in the first place. Yes, it is a blend of Iron Man (the suit &amp; powers), Spider-Man (the character), and Ms Marvel (the family dynamic)... but it just works so well. It's a little too silly and cringe at times with a somewhat cliche story, but it's just so charming and has so much heart you can't help but enjoy it! A huge surprise for me - turned out to be one of the better DC films!",8
" I am afraid DC just blue itself
","The pre-New 52 Blue Beetle comic was solid and Jaime was decently used in some cartoons but has been on a string of Ls outside of that. His first and last solo movie is the latest one. A Disney Channel Original, as expected, with wonky direction, writing and performances. Even the Karate Kid star forgot how to act despite being decent in that show. The equally dreaded Aquahombre 2 will be the final time I sit through a DC film no matter what or even watch one blindly. Thank god that audiences continue to firmly reject the late-stage DCEU as we continue to reach new lows that even Sony would be ashamed of. If the film flopping in Mexico (I know that the IP is set in Texas) can´t prove that WB CEOs Hamada and now Safran make movies without an audience then I don´t know what can. The worst one yet after Josstice League and Jack Kirby´s OMAC being misused as another bland doppelgänger villain is the cherry on top.",4
" Likeable
","Newly-graduated Jaime Reyes returns to his family, living in a poor section of a city where the wealthy are gradually encroaching. He gets a menial job with his sister Milagro at a hotel, which he promptly loses, fired by Victoria Kord, CEO of Kord Industries. Jaaime was sticking up for Jenny Kord, daughter of missing previous CEO Ted Kord, and she subsequently slips him a mysterious item which Victoria wants back, and she is prepared to get it.<br><br>As a superhero origin story, this is perhaps fairly routine, albeit perfectly functional and a decent enough story in its own right - someone trying to cope with new tech which is beyond their experience is a well-worn trope, but with plenty of scope for humour, for instance. But Jaime's family add a lot of texture and heart to this movie. They are nicely and strongly characterised, and there are some great and emotional moments featuring them. They are not strictly necessary to the plot, arguably, but they strongarm their way in and demand a place.<br><br>If I have a criticism of this film, it is that there is a lot of dialogue in subtitled Spanish. I have no problem with this, and it's a good thing that a big-budget super-hero movie is built around a heavily Hispanic character/cast, but I know there is a not insignificant chunk of audience who dislike reading subtitles. So, on the one hand maybe this is restricting the film's audience. On the other, Everything Everywhere All At Once, right?",7
" Don't let it bug you.
","'Blue Beetle (2023)' is... actually pretty good? It's a bit of a weird one in the sense that it's exactly what you'd expect and it's even pretty janky in places, but it's pretty fun when it gets going (even while committing the same mistakes a lot of its peers have been making for the past two decades) and its emotionality is surprisingly resonant at times. You've seen it all before, for sure: a generic and slightly intangible origin story that focuses on heavy-handed themes of family (it might as well be an entry in the 'Fast and Furious' franchise) and has its hero eventually take on a baddie that's basically just a palette swap of them. Yet, there's just something that makes it more enjoyable than most of the other entries in the DCEU, an intangible charm that you can't quite put your finger on no matter how hard you try. The cast are mostly charismatic (the good guys, at least; Susan Sarandon is sleepwalking here and the main henchman is really boring), the comedy sometimes makes you chuckle (mostly thanks to George Lopez), the action is fairly energetic, and the messaging - as ham-fisted and often forced as it is - often leads to some shockingly affecting moments that make you realise how invested in the characters you must actually be. It's actually the latter that tips this into the solidly 'good' category for me, as a lot of the affair is middling to decent at best. It's honestly fairly forgettable, too. Overall, though, it just works way more than it ought to; it's better than the sum of its parts. It's not something I'm desperate to watch again, but it's far better than 'Black Adam (2022)' and it's a bit of a shame that it sits in this odd limbo between the existing DCEU and James Gunn's upcoming DCU. It's not going to cure your superhero fatigue, but it should entertain you if you're not tired of this stuff just yet.",7
" An Above Average Superhero Origin Film
","DC is in a bit of a flux right now as they are between the end of DCEU and the start of the new DCU, but we have Blue Beetle now and I saw it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man become combined with an alien scarab that gives him special powers, this causes him to be hunted down by nefarious enemies.<br><br>Main Character
Xolo Mariduena has been a young actor mainly known for his really good work on Cobra Kai. He plays Jaime Reyes here and he is great in the role. He brings plenty of vibrance to the role of Jaime and he nails the emotional scenes too. This is just a really likeable main character and I thought he did a really good job of being a lead for a character that I am pretty sure the majority of mainstream viewers no very little about.<br><br>Supporting Characters
This has a large group of supporting characters and some of them work, some of them don't. Bruna Marquenzie plays Jenny Kord and is a big ally to Jaime Reyes, she was good in the film and I liked the chemistry between the two of them. It was nothing special, but it worked in this film and I think she has a pretty decent future ahead of her.<br><br>This story really focuses on family, the main one being the Reyes family and all of them do a fantastic job in really building that bond. George Lopez is probably my favourite as his uncle and he provided the most laughs in the film. But all of them were great in their roles.<br><br>But the villains of this film fell flat for me. Susan Sarandon plays Victoria Kord and she is just really dull, she doesn't really add much to this role. It's not that she is terrible or anything like that it is just she is the most forgettable part of the film. They try to give the other villain Carapax some character but it is way too late to get the impact that I think people wanted.<br><br>Story
The best thing I can say about the story is that it is pretty functional. It does a good job with the Reyes family and how their bond strengthens Jaime and his ability as Blue Beetle with this linked to Jenny and her family it works too. But this is a really generic story, it would have been way better if it came out 15 years ago but we have seen everything here before in other films. It tries something towards the end of the film to rise it up but it doesn't quite work and makes the film feel a bit cheesy and predictable.<br><br>Script
The script is okay, there is some decent humour and drama in there that makes this an entertaining watch. But sometimes, the humour feels a bit forced, I mean it feels like some of the weaker MCU films with comedy that doesn't quite work. The drama also is a mixed bag with some of it not really working in the context that they want.<br><br>Style
The film looks pretty good. I like the design of the Blue Beetle suit, especially with it being a mostly practical suit, the film has some real exuberant colour and feel to it which is really great to see. Though, as I kind of mentioned before, the pacing and structure of the film doesn't quite work and is quite generic with a few lacklustre action scenes.<br><br>Overall
Overall, Blue Beetle is an above average film. This is an entertaining watch, especially for a new character on the big screen, but it plays it pretty safe and never does enough to push itself into a better film. If you are interested in this film then I would say give it a chance, just don't expect the next Dark Knight.<br><br>Rating - 6/10.",6

It's so bad that you end up not caring about the characters or what's happening because your not a 5yo child who is mesmerized by the bright colors and fight scenes. I'm not sure if that was what the movie was meant to be or if the marketing was off but it misses the mark when compared to other DC superhero movies.

" A good movie trapped inside of a terrible movie.
","These sorts of movies are particularly frustrating for me. Much like when I checked out of Flash during the ""baby shower"" scene, I checked out of Blue Beetle when the protagonist's family sings a theme song from a novella in the midst of a life-and-death situation.<br><br>You throw away story momentum and character intrigue for a cheap joke, and suddenly the cinematic experience is reduced to waiting for the next ""yuk yuk"" of a muppet show. This could have been the perfect sling-shot of a film to move the DCU into the rebooted universe. Instead, it's yet another example of how the superhero genre is weakening by the month.<br><br>I don't blame the casting, though. Xolo Maridueña is solid as the lead, Jaime Reyes. Bruna Marquezine, who I'll admit may just have helped me confirm what my ""type"" is in a woman with her sheer beauty and presence, did plenty of heavy lifting fot the emotional center of the film as Jenny Kord, niece of the villain of the movie (played expertly by Susan Sarandon). And yes, George Lopez wasn't bad.<br><br>There's just too much silly family stuff to make me actually believe in the family aspect of the story; like someone trying so hard to be liked it makes it difficult to like them. I guess I blame the writing, primarily, but the director has also got to pick a theme. Is it like a Batman film directed by Joel Schumacher or Christopher Nolan, because you can't have both.<br><br>I do think this would be a decent family-friendly film. The special effects are top notch, the fights are believably choreographed, a few jokes actually hit, and there is not only an origin story but a redemptive arc, as well. So it's not an awful movie by any stretch. It just could have been much, much more.",5

The dialogues are boring. The characters feel forced, and it seems like the actors were pushed in front of the cameras at gunpoint. The only bright spot is the visual aspect, but there aren't enough effects to pull the movie out of the mud. Oh, even most of the action scenes are dull!<br><br>All in all, below average. I won't say it's a waste of time - that would be too harsh, but not far from the truth.",3
" Hello fellow humans
","Hello all<br><br>Well I am wondering is this movie a standalone or will this character be a part of James Gunn's DC Universe. This is what is so frustrating is that DC wants what Marvel has. But they tossed away all their work because it didn't make as much as Marvel/Disney. So now they hired the main director from Marvel and will restart everything. Which is why viewers get annoyed.<br><br>So you get movies that leave you asking is this a part of the greater story or just its own world. Blue Beetle does mention Batman, Superman, Flash. So I guess they are in the world. But is this during, after, separate from the Flash Movie? If it is just an introduction movie ok fine. It was an introduction movie and we will see Blue Beetle more in the DC Universe. However if this was a standalone movie that will have nothing to do with any other movies in the DCU then it was not good at all as a standalone movie.<br><br>The movie was half just intro. I felt like an hour was just him and his family and whatever. I get you need to introduce your character. But if I was the director within the first 15 minutes he would have become the Blue Beetle. He would not have been such a (insert word) about becoming Blue Beetle. Let's be honest if I was in his situation I would be super excited. I would fly around. I would go into space. I would blow things up in the desert to see what I can do. I would not ha e spent an hour of him trying to not be a super hero. Because most people would love what happened to him. I get they are trying to make him the cute ole shucks kind of guy. But it is annoying.<br><br>Then we are to except all this 1980s 1990s stuff is supposed to just work and is amazingly high tech even though the processor back than were crappier than a Raspberry Pi. I wanted to like the movie and I really was hoping the ending credit was going to show something amazing. But it was a cartoon my friend said was of a real life show from Mexico apparently. As a guy from California it made no sense to me. The cartoon was funny but I didn't get the reference at all. But even my friend who knew what the cartoon was, was unhappy that the end credit didn't show anything interesting.<br><br>It made us both wonder is this a movie a standalone movie and we will never see Blue Beetle again. Is it because James Gunn didn't help make the movie so they just half assed it, because they figured it wasn't going to be a part of the DCU. I truly hope the DCU uses Darkside and Black Adam.",6

This is a short american view of the neighborgh country with the the same kind of history with Latinoamerica and specially the south border country although also applies for mos of the rest of the wold when trying to project stereotypes. Most of the mexicans dont want to live there for makind big ""amount"" of money in the marvelous utopian dreaming place, eating fast food, consume opioids, watching TV and being big fan of actress (actors)-musician and admire rich people(of course, an ironic comment regarding stereotypes).",5
" The incarnation of mediocrity
","This year's new installment of the increasingly numerous average superhero movies was this one. There's nothing original; the character's origin is once again poorly and haphazardly narrated with childish jokes, and in many aspects, it's quite mediocre.<br><br>I won't go into detail about missing this scene or that scene. Overall, the movie is just flat; a few scenes can bring a smile, and one scene was purely emotional, but other than that, I felt like I was watching a movie I've seen every year.<br><br>Speaking about the characters in general, if I come to Carapax, his origin is enjoyable, but in trying to adapt the villain to the present day, they've turned the character into an ordinary one that has lost its appeal. Nana Reyes is the worst character in the movie; I've never seen such a forced character that's not funny at all. They've written absurd scenes, claiming she's a grandmother who can do everything; I couldn't make any sense of it. Xolo Mariduena fits the role, in my opinion, but no one around him shines in the film.<br><br>I found DCU's initial character introduction to be mediocre as well. The quality of this film is truly mediocre; while watching, I felt like they were treating us a bit foolishly. The fact that the government doesn't get involved in any events, and the police or any higher authority doesn't intervene, made me feel incredibly foolish. Yes, maybe Kord could be a big corporation in the film, but it wasn't realistic at all.<br><br>These companies really need a more realistic scenario and a visionary perspective. At the same time, they need directors who genuinely read the comics, understand the characters, and have knowledge of them...<br><br>Addition: After seeing its budget, I felt like a fool; approving such a mediocre project for this much money is truly questionable for the future of the studio, in my opinion.",5
" Just bad and typical
",I watched this movie a month ago when it came out and i came out of that theater just sad and dissappointed. The movie constantly uses bad comedy to drive the plot (which is even worse by the fact that it is not listed as a comedy movie) which is already so predictable and cliche. Going into this movie i thought it would be a 7/10 fun movie but it was not that thing as i mentioned previously. Also the characters and their development is non existent . The villians are sub-par and have extremely predictable arcs. The ending was just badly written and feels more like a disney channel movie ending. Not recommend.,4
" Awful movie

I will mention that I could not continue watching this after 1 hour in, so take that in mind.<br><br>Acting: amateur.<br><br>Dialogues: as if the writers used ChatGPT, asking it specifically to generate the most shallow, boring, brain numbing text it can.<br><br>CGI: I've seen movies released in the early 2000s with better effects.<br><br>Characters: shallow and childish.<br><br>All in all, this is just another superhero movie, a really bad one. On the other hand, if you've had trouble sleeping lately and need something to help with that, watch this.",1
" Part 3 of the end
","The time is ticking...
There are three films in 2023 that are significant for the downfall of the MCU or the superhero genre in general. Story, nothing new, effects, mediocre, actors, average at most, entertainment, only as a hardline fan. So all of them are on a similarly low wavelength from the general level, but in the Single Film the central character always makes the music. All three characters are rather unimportant in their universes, so the actor has to be taken as a reference. And there I prefer the grey mouse to the idiot and even more so to the creep. Now I think everyone can encode my ranking.",5

" Is DC..... back?
","Not yet but finally we have a step in the right direction. I chose to see Blue Beetle on a whim, because I love George Lopez and the Blue Beetle character in multiple Teen Titans runs. My expectations were pretty low and they were blown away. This movie isn't perfect, but I didn't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I did. The theme of family allows this film to be a classic coming of age tale wrapped inside the ""I don't want to be a superhero"" trope.<br><br>Blue Beetle made me and a lot of my theater laugh out loud constantly throughout the film. It was quite funny. Xolo Maridueña is charming and committed as the lead, Jaime Reyes. His facial a&amp; body acting was especially good and really sold the role for me. George Lopez is absolutely hilarious and delivers multiple chaotic screams that sent me. Jaime's family is very well done, comedic, soulful and a pleasurable addition to the story.<br><br>The range of quality on digital effects is sorta wide. When just Jaime as the Blue Beetle is on the screen, I think the digital effects are quite good. When other effects and characters in CGI suits are added, they definitely fall down a peg.<br><br>Bruna Marquezine, playing Jaime's love interest, was one of the weaker performances. Her American accent went in and out and it really took me out of the movie at times. Her character isn't too well written either which doesn't help.<br><br>Susan Sarandon's villain character is something. I like the archetype, I don't care for the execution, and I think she's a bit of a caricature of a super villain by the end.<br><br>I think people should see this movie. If you spent time to see The Flash, Batman v Superman, Wonder Woman 1984, Black Adam or Shazam 2, you should ABSOLUTELY see Blue Beetle. It is far superior to many DCEU entries of the past 5-7 years.",7
" I was really surprised...just kidding, it's the same again
","I guess at this point every one of us who went through the bitter-sweet journey(mostly bitter) of watching every superhero movie that was released in the last 15 years or so is now on one hand worthy of a huge prize(or at least some kind of refund for all the wasted money for the majority of the movies) and on the other hand is capable of making a superhero movie or at least this type of superhero movie. Yes, I'm pretty sure about that and not because I'm an expert or because of unreserved believe in the ability of this community of masochistic Marvel and DC supporters but because the formula is always the same and we all know it.<br><br>I can't deny some successful elements that still exists(the overall ability to make visually well looking scenes; some good jokes among the other absolutely unnecessary ones; the acting is also believable and on the right place) but just because something works partly doesn't mean that it isn't rotting in its essence and needs drastic change in its core expressed in removal of the shallowness and replacing in it with meaningful and original to every movie narrative and relationship between the characters whose arc should be unfold slowly and captivatingly.<br><br>PS.

" Entertaining film.
","""Blue Beetle"" is a typical superhero movie but better than many others, this time with a script based on Jaime Reyes, a Mexican superhero. The performances are good, highlighting Elpidia Carrillo, Adriana Barraza and Susan Sarandon, the latter as a villain. The cinematography is well done, the music composed for the film goes unnoticed and the special effects manage to be good in some scenes while failing to look real in others. The songs used were not really well chosen, there were only two really good Mexican songs, the rest are based on the stereotype of rural Mexico. An entertaining superhero movie without being a masterpiece.",7
" Really Great!
","Blue Beetle<br><br>This was a great action movie, the whole thing rested on Xolo Maridueña, who played Jaime Reyes, he was so endearing, charming and charismatic that you couldn't help but cheer for our accidental hero. He really has got an incredible natural acting talent and would be perfect as a detective hunting down serial killers in Manhattan.<br><br>The movie rested too heavily on caricatures of Mexicans, the Rey family were economic migrants to Texas, some legal some not, constantly griping about the haves and the have nots, however, it was clear, like so many they were starting again from the very bottom and very fact that Jamie had a degree in law shows the possibilities for social mobility in America.<br><br>The whole cast was great but all the evil people were all ""white and entitled"", seemingly having to prove there were and good intentions, this was so obviously a political statement that I felt insulted, and maybe a little alienated and offended.<br><br>I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10 for a great origin story.",7

" My recommendation: Wait for streaming
","The latest DC superhero film, ""Blue Beetle"" seems to promise a combination of explosive action and sharp comedy, all wrapped around a kid friendly adventure where the importance of family is stressed above all else - and in a way, ""Blue Beetle"" delivers that. With ample heart, charm, and entertainment-value, ""Blue Beetle"" has more than enough to warrant a viewing on a rainy afternoon; it's nothing remarkable, but the characters are fun, the comedy hits, and the action is filmed well. The problem is, for all its action and comedy and positive messages, at the end of the day there is nothing remarkable about ""Blue Beetle.""<br><br>Originally planned for a direct-to-streaming release on HBO Max, ""Blue Beetle"" ultimately ended up being released in theatres, and I'm honestly not sure that it should have been. The word ""generic"" is written all over this film; with little to distinguish it in terms of plot, direction, and action, this flick falls directly in the category of ""average."" Listen, ""Blue Beetle"" doesn't offer you anything you haven't seen before - and besides the 80s synth score and occasional touch of neon-drenched decor, there's nothing too innovative at play here. And to be honest, at first I didn't mind because I was, admittedly, having a good time with it - by the third act, however, I found my enjoyment dwindling as the film failed to provide anything fresh.<br><br>Simply put, the movie is just stale; from the evil corporate villain to the Power Ranger-esque look and feel of the titular hero, everything looks and feels dated, almost as if directly ripped from an early 2000s superhero movie. And no matter how many jokes the characters tell or action set pieces the movie throws at its audience, the movie doesn't have anything original to say or do during its runtime. And for some, that won't be a problem - my cousin really enjoyed the movie, and, if I am to judge my audience's reception based on the amount of laughter I heard during my showing, I'd assume that they enjoyed it as well. But, God, I just wanted something new to happen.<br><br>Take the action sequences, for example. I feel like there's a lot you can do with the idea of a symbiotic suit that can create any weapon its wearer imagines.... and instead, all the movie gives us is a sword fight and some blasters that look like they're from Halo. Is that really the best they could come up with? And also, the action sequences were astoundingly small scale - for something shown on the big screen, I started to feel like I'd have a better time watching the action scenes on YouTube from my laptop; there's really just no reason for someone to see this in a theatre, as the movie doesn't feel theatrical.<br><br>All of my complaining aside, however, I don't hate this movie - as I said, I had some fun with it, and I'll definitely revisit it at some point. I just don't think this is a movie you have to rush out to see, and if you do want to see it, I'd recommend waiting for streaming. Sure, you can enjoy this movie at the theatre, but you can have just as good or better a time with it at home with a pizza and a few beers.",6

" Blue Beetle Was A Bit Disappointing😕
","For the very first time we got a live-action movie about Blue Beetle. I went and watched it at the theatre, and man, it was... Something new from DC, only that they were using the same superhero stuff over and over again. You know, a person got bit by an insect, superpowers, the superheroes girlfriend, I just feel that we got the same plot a million times before, but in different versions. The new thing is that this is mostly with a Latin-American cast, and the plot take place in Mexico.<br><br>If you mix Spider-Man with Iron Man, and maybe put Coco on the side, we are getting Blue Beetle. Even if the movie was generic, and sometimes some childish humor, it was some things that I liked. The action scenes were awesome, well planned and preformed, and the music score was great, too. The acting was pretty ok. But besides, this movie was generic, offers nothing new, and it doesn't expend the DC universe a lot, we just got a superhero movie that just popped out of nowhere. So if you want some fun, go and watch it, if you like DC, this is maybe not the best choice, but it's ok. After theatre I can't say I really like it. It was just ok. If you are going to watch some DC, I recommend The Flash or Joker more that this movie. Really Generic, but good action.",6
" Amazingly Good

The entire family cast did an outstanding job bringing it home. I cried a few times cuz their relationship was so good and so well done. You do care about them and you do root for the hero. Xolo was excellent as Blue Beetle bringing his top acting and humbleness to the role that we have seen in Cobra Kai.<br><br>The action sequences are very good as well and they are very entertaining overall.

George Lopez is hilarious in this movie it was great to see him back in action &amp; on a big screen. If you love comic book movies please do yourself a favor and watch this! It is really good and keeps you on the edge of your seat, it's got funny, thrilling, and emotional parts.

Good redemption plot as the story builds for one of the villains, well written and directed. Nothing questionable or non family friendly, violence is mild and not too over the top.

" A comic that was turned into a joke.
",This was such a bad movie. They really wasted a good character. Terrible acting except for Susan Sarandon. Terrible story line. Terrible props. Terrible everything. It was so comic it was a joke. I feel sorry for and actors involved in this movie as it's unlikely they'll get another role. DC just can't get anything right. There is so much potential for this character but it requires that it be given to people who can do it right and suspend our disbelief. To make it as real as possible despite being a comic. This is an appealing case for paying good writers properly. I hope this review will be read constructively despite its negativity to improve in the future.,1

He gets superpowers and struggles to control them. I could go on, but you get the point. The characters are kinda bland. The love story isn't believable. I have no idea why those two should be together at the end, except for ""He has a family and I don't"". Talking about the family.... . There's an annoying sister, a father for character development, a mother to give a pep talk at the end, an uncle who's a techie and for some reason knows how to build stuff and knows how to fly a ""space"" ship and a grandma who acts like she's Rambo, has some hidden anger issues and knows how to use guns (but she'll ""tell you all about it later""). I guess even the writers didn't care anymore at this point. I don't know man. It just wasn't that interesting.

" The most ridiculous super-hero ever, but a fun watch.
","The most ridiculous super-hero ever. Full of clichés, but a fun watch with great pacing and a great ending.<br><br>For starters, this is apparently a super-hero for Mexicans (Hispanics, eventually? Sorry: I can't never get my head around American race wars). It's only natural that global conglomerates finally start to act locally (remember the ""think global, act local"" motto from the 1990's?...) However, everything in the story was either started or developed by Americans (Ted Kord - the good brother, and Susan Sarandon's character - the bad sister)... which means that although it LOOKS made for Mexicans, it kind'a has a ""colonialist"" after-taste.<br><br>Anyway, if I was a Mexican I would feel deeply insulted by the depiction of this caricature of a Mexican family, as it's wrong in so many ways (from the multiple instances of embarrassing public behavior of the whole family to the depiction of the grandma in the brink of an orgasm while shooting people with what looks like a Nintendo version of a Gatling gun).<br><br>Anyway, let's get into specifics.<br><br>First of all, the whole saga starts off with the all-too-common unwitting-and-unwilling hero who is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Fine... But there is a little twist in it: his fat sister with eyeglasses (a double cliché) is the stupid one who actually starts everything. She's the one responsible for effing up her brother's homecoming with bad news (when explicitly told by everyone else in the family NOT to do it), then goes on to get herself and her brother fired because she wanted to take a dump in the boss's toilet (?!), then she acts like a child and manages to unleash this alien drone that goes up her brother's behind and gets the whole story in motion... then later she's the one responsible for their dad's fatal heart attack! Somehow, nobody cares that this stupid chick just screws everything up.<br><br>On the other end of the racial+social spectrum, the rich girl is always saying ""Sorry! Sorry!"" even though she didn't do anything wrong and explicitly told the dude to not mess with the effing scarab in the first place...
Is this the current zeitgeist? Are we, as viewers, supposed to think that it is OK to be a dimwit who ruins everything if you are a girl? A poor girl? A fat girl? A girl with glasses? All of the above? Are we supposed to think that anyone who is born into poverty should be excused of everything, from being fired to getting their dad an heart attack (or getting their brother sodomized by an alien drone)? Are we supposed to think that anyone who is born into wealth must be constantly apologizing even to the stupid idiots who screw up everything by ignoring every warning?<br><br>All this is deeply disturbing if you think about it. I rather not, but I'm still aware of it and I can't avoid mentioning it. But let's move on...<br><br>More clichés:
1. Nowadays we use tons of software applications that have several deployments per day without the need for a ""reboot"", but still... highly evolved alien technology beyond human comprehension always has to ""reboot"" at some plot point. And it has to take several minutes, so that the bad guys get a fighting chance.<br><br>2. ""Good"" is always blue, ""bad"" is always red. Hollywood is like paint by numbers.<br><br>3. The bad guy looks exactly like a Gundam robot or something out of Power Rangers. I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of copyright lawsuits are coming up their way.<br><br>4. The good guy is such a sucker that he always refuses to shoot to kill, even after seeing his family under live gunfire, and his dad dying. I guess this is supposed to be a ""family movie"", so lethal action is dialed down to a minimum. (although this gets an exception near the end of the movie, which is completely out of character and blatantly just for the sake of that specific plot point...)
5. The ""sentient alien technology"" has a sexy female voice.<br><br>Bottom line: this is a highly flawed movie, with some disturbing undertones you should be aware of, but it is actually very entertaining due to very good craftsmanship from everyone involved. Particularly, the production design, direction, editing and acting are very good, and the pacing is perfect. Plus, you get a (predictable but) gratifying ending.<br><br>Regardless of the above criticism, if you're into superhero movies then you surely got to see this one.",4
" A fair enough superhero movie...
","When I sat down to watch the 2023 movie ""Blue Beetle"", I was only familiar with the character from an animated DC movie that I watched some time ago. I have never read any comics with the character or anything, so I only knew very little about what I was in for here. So on that account, then writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer and director Angel Manuel Soto had every opportunity to impress and entertain me.<br><br>The storyline in ""Blue Beetle"", as written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, proved to be fairly okay. It was a rather generic storyline actually, for a superhero movie, but it definitely made for adequate entertainment, which is the purpose of the movie. So that was definitely good enough. I wasn't impressed with the story, though, and I can't say that writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer convinced me to venture out and get to know more about the character and the stories that he is in.<br><br>Visually then ""Blue Beetle"" was great. The special effects and CGI looked good, though there is an overwhelming abundance of bright neon-color themes throughout the movie, which made me think of the 1980s. Sometimes less is more, which somewhat applies here; I think if they had toned down on the excessive use of bright flourescent colors everywhere, then it would have been a bit more enjoyable. But I will say that the special effects and CGI definitely helped to make the movie all the more enjoyable and watchable.<br><br>The acting performances in the movie were good, and Xolo Maridueña was nicely cast for the leading role of Jaime Reyes. Aside from Xolo Maridueña, then the only other familiar faces on the cast list for me were Susan Sarandon and George Lopez, with the latter sporting a horrible beard and even worse mullet. I think it was a shame that actress Belissa Escobedo weren't given a more prominent role with more screentime and more influence on the storyline, because she seemed to be able to bring something enjoyable to the movie.<br><br>Essentially then ""Blue Beetle"" didn't really bring much of anything new to the superhero genre, aside from it being a Latino/Hispanic-based superhero, I suppose. So ""Blue Beetle"" was actually rather generic in some aspects.<br><br>If you enjoy superhero movies, then ""Blue Beetle"" should be candy for you. I sat down to watch it as a casual viewer, as I am not a superhero fan, but watch them for the mindless entertainment they tend to provide, which also was the case for ""Blue Beetle"".<br><br>My rating of director Angel Manuel Soto's 2023 movie lands on a six out of ten stars.",6
" Blue beetle has finally won the box office
","What a wild movie . The story taking place after the justice league, and the suicide squad. Jaime was the perfect young boy to carry the blue beetle and use that power for good and carry his fathers love and strength. Susan Sarandon was absolutely awesome in the movie. After going coco I'm rugrats in Paris 23 years and now she's finally playing a villain for the first time in live action dc movie history. I hope she works for dc and Warner bros again cuase she's got a remarkable way of playing a character so well . George Lopez really nailed it . His comedian and hilarious jokes really made blue beetle a big sensation. Xolo Maridueña As Jaime was the perfect actor for blue beetle . I hope to see Xolo Maridueña work for dc again and join forces with the justice league. Bruna Marquezine Was absolutely remarkable for playing Jenny kord .<br><br>I like to thank the crew for working so hard on this project even though they're striking for they're rights and support for the movie. I hope in the future dc does more films and series ajd gives the actors and actresses protection.<br><br>Blue beetle win the box office success.",10
" That was painful..
","The entire movie is. So you were 'chosen' to have superhero powers but the protagonist doesn't want it and instead just want a job? A JOB? No teenage boy or young adult would say that (Or even people with a job!), that's the part where I knew I'm in for a rough time. Well that, and the part where he bit into the taco and went 'mmmm' without even chewing for flavor.<br><br>Why was he 'chosen' again? Cause he white-knighted for the girl?<br><br>A chopper with a weapon is trying to kill/capture your family, beetle boy got a clear shot to incapacitate them all but one look at his father having a heart attack made him stop what he is doing. He didn't think for a second that by stopping the threat targeting EVERYONE might be a better decision than to stop and get emotional and thereby get caught anyway? OMG stop I can't watch anymore<br><br>So a few minutes later he would refuse to kill or at least permanently disable villains who would try and kill his family while at the same time his family members found it easy to step / impale soldiers with a huge bug leg. I'm so done with this.",2
" Blue Beetle
","This film was the fourteenth instalment of the DC Extended Universe, I was hoping it would join Wonder Woman, Shazam!, Birds of Prey, The Suicide Squad, and The Flash among the good ones, while the others have been average or terrible. Basically, in a remote part of Antarctica, Kord Industries co-founder and CEO Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) leads a team to locate an ancient alien artifact known as the Scarab. Meanwhile, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) has graduated from Gotham Law University and has returned to his hometown of Palmera City, only to learn that his immigrant Mexican family face eviction from their home due to financial difficulties. Jaime's sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) manages to get him a job cleaning at Victoria's mansion. However, they are both are fired after Jaime intervenes in a confrontation between Victoria and her niece Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), daughter of Kord Industries inventor and founder Ted Kord. Jenny thanks Jaime for trying to help and suggests he meets her the following day at Kord Tower to discuss a ""job opportunity"". The next day, Jenny finds out that Victoria intends to use the Scarab for her One Man Army Corps (OMAC) projects, to create an army of soldiers with high-tech armoured weaponised suits. Jaime goes to Kord Industries looking for, and when he finds her in a rush, she gives him the Scarab hidden inside a Big Belly Burger box to avoid security, telling him to guard it and not to open it. At home, Jaime's family convinces him to open the box, they find the Scarab and pass it around. While nothing happens with the others, Jaime touches the Scarab, it activates and launches into his face, terrifying the family. It crawls down and painfully infuses itself into his back, and his body is encased by a set of alien exoskeleton armour. The voice of the Scarab, later identified as Khaji-Da (Becky G) speaks to him, it begins a check of its systems, launching him into space, deactivating and sending him back to Earth, and flying him across the city causing damage. When Jaime eventually returns home, completely naked, the family argue what to do. Jaime's uncle Rudy (George Lopez) insists they cannot get the police involved, convinced that they work for Kord. Jaime later goes to find Jenny for answers, rescuing her from Victoria's armed forces. She tells Jaime that the Scarab is a sentient weapon, it chooses its own host. The Scarab cannot be removed without risking death, but there is a chance of getting it off using a digital key stored at Kord Industries. Rudy, Jaime, and Jenny break into Kord Tower to retrieve a smartwatch that once belonged to Jenny's father. They are attacked by Victoria's bodyguard Ignacio Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo), who has an OMAC prototype infused in his body. Khaji-Da temporarily takes over Jaime's body and battles Carapax, proving the suit's indestructibility. Rudy and Jenny help incapacitate Carapax, then escape with Jaime to take refuge in Jenny's childhood home. Jenny uses Ted's watch to activate his secret laboratory, revealing to Jaime that Ted was originally a vigilante named Blue Beetle. Ted spent years studying Khaji-Da before mysteriously disappearing, leaving the company to Victoria. When the group notice Victoria's helicopter approaching Jaime's home, Jaime summons Khaji-Da and returns to protect his family. As they escape, Jaime's father Alberto (Damián Alcázar) suffers a fatal heart attack, distracting Jaime and allowing Carapax to capture him. Jaime is taken to an island fortress in Cuba, where he is strapped to a machine that downloads information from Khaji-Da to the OMACs. While unconscious, Jaime has a vision of being in the afterlife with his father who encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Jaime awakens, moments after the download is completed; he is helped out by scientist Dr. Jose Francisco Morales Rivera de la Cruz, aka ""Sanchez"" (Harvey Guillén) who hates the pain Victoria is causing and betrays her. But Jose is killed by Carapax whose OMAC suit activates and evolves into a more powerful form. Jenny, Milagro, Jaime's mother Rocio (Elpidia Carrillo), and Jaime's grandmother Nana (Adriana Barraza) use Ted's Bugship to travel to the fortress. They arm themselves with the arsenal of weapons aboard, with Nana revealing her hidden background in warfare. Jaime reunites with his family, then encounters Carapax and battles him. Jaime nearly kills Carapax before Khaji-Da shows Jaime Carapax's past memories of enslavement for the OMAC experiments, and the death of his mother, both events are attributed to terrorist Victoria. Jaime spares Carapax, who rebels against Victoria, getting vengeance for his mother and setting his OMAC suit to explode, killing himself and Victoria, and destroying the island. As the Reyes family escapes from the island, they take time to mourn Alberto. In the aftermath, Jenny becomes the new CEO of Kord Industries and offers to help save and rebuild the Reyes family home. As the neighbours gather around the remains of the house to offer support, Jaime shares a kiss with Jenny, and flies her to the Kord Estate. In a mid-credits scene, a distorted voice is broadcast in Ted's laboratory; it is Ted trying to communicate that he is alive. Also starring Modesto Lacen as General Crane, Brianna Quinn Lewis as Kord Receptionist, Ayden Rivera as Kid Carapax, Xol Gonzalez as Teen Carapax, and Yuli Zorrilla as Carapax's Mother. Maridueña is alright as the twenty-something young man who becomes, Sarandon (who I haven't seen in a film for years) is a relatively sinister villain, Lopez is likeable as the enthusiastic uncle, and Barraza gets some hilarious scene-stealing moments as the feisty Mexican granny. I agree with the critics that the family element is very strong and very appealing, the supporting characters and villains are alright, the special effects are great to create some satisfying fight and chase sequences, it does feel like something you have seen before, but it is funny, exciting, and engaging in the right moments, overall, an enjoyable superhero fantasy action adventure. Good!",6
" Meh, as a Hispanic, was sorta disappointed
","All I can say, is they could have picked a more talented lead actor for the Blue Beatle &amp; the corniness kinda killed my vibe.(in Kendrick Lamar Voice) but it's DC, soooo. What do you expect! I'd wait for it to stream. I'd recommend Teenage Mutant Turtles if you're looking for a complete movie. I went in expecting a ton more but the only actor that earned his money was. G. Lopez. I don't know where this film will lead on the DC universe but hoping they get better! Should have expected less. Kids might be entertained while also being babysat &amp; that's all you can ask for. Hoping more Mexican superheroes can step their game up! Please! Or should I say, Por Favor!",5
" Blue Beetle
","Maybe this should just have been called the ""Blue Bottle"" after the annoying blowfly that buzzes around annoyingly to no apparent purpose? Susan Sarandon (why?) is the megalomanic corporate mogul ""Kord"" who is out to create a super-soldier (""OMAC"") using an extra-terrestrial scarab that can synergise an human being with an almost indestructible endo-skeleton. Fortunately for all of us, her cleaning lady likes to use the luxury bathroom at her home, and when she is caught and quite literally dumped, she and her brother find themselves out of work and introduced to ""Jenny"" (Bruna Marquezine) - the strong-minded niece of our baddie - who is determined to thwart the militarisation of her daddy's company. She smuggles the gadget out of their HQ and manages to pass it to the rather earnest and drippy brother ""Jaime"" (Xolo Maridueña) with strict instructions not to even open the box. Of course they do, and next thing he and the glowing blue gizmo are best mates - he can fly, zip around with great speed and has, of course, super-human strength. ""Cord"" is determined to get it back, so she energises her already semi-mechanised henchman ""Carapax"" (Raoul Max Trujillo) for a gradual/glacial build up to a denouement that a bat could see from space. This has all the feel to it of a standard television movie. Great visual effects but lightning pyrotechnics, cleaving a bus in half and endless explosions are no longer enough to sell a film. There has to be some semblance of originality with the thing. Aside from it's bilinguality, this has precious little by way of innovation to shout for it. The characters are largely forgettable - especially the annoying uncle ""Rudy"" (George Lopez) who's astonishing adeptness with all things super-tech was just plain daft! It's also way, way too long and I felt the ominous presence of a sequel looming at the end quite sad. This is a weak story with a weak cast that seems designed to fill a gap in the USA's expanding and under-served Hispanic market. I think it may work there? I'm not so sure anyone else needs this.",6
" B Movie at best
","Where do I start, went in to see the film full of hope, left disbelieving what I had just seen. The acting is so bad from all concerned even Susan Sarandon, who is normally so good. Think it was trying to be funny at times but it was just so cheesey and unfunny, Nanna turns out to be a gun wielding pilot lol, special effects we're quite good, action scenes good too but same old story that we have seen a million times before, very clichéd film, i would have walked out if it wasnt for my grandson being with me, not sure if they'll make s part 2, in my opinion do not waste your money on this rubbish.",4
" Excellent for what it is!
",Probably could've seen sooner but glad I saw today and was didn't expect how most the seats were used except the front maybe cause it's a marvel when I got my ticket yesterday only 1 other person had there's so it was nice to see at least 30 people. Anyways this movie was quite enjoyable I kept being on the fence about it cause it didn't do well not really sure why cause it's awesome for a superhero story that is fun and has somber moments too. Blue Beetle is exactly what it should be to me and has a lot of great action/heartfelt movements that really bind everything together to become a perfect taco lol!,8
" Good action, a few plot holes - a good weekend entertainer
","It's not the best superhero movie, nor is it the worst one. It had good moments and it has glaring plot holes. Good cgi and a coherent plot sprinkled with good old family sentiments. Ignore the few unnecessary politically driven digs and you'll enjoy it.<br><br>You'll find a lot of Spanish song references and throwbacks as well. All good fun. Personally I didn't get many of those references as I'm not Spanish. It was fun hearing them and the rest of the audience burst out in laughter nevertheless.<br><br>Don't see this because of the diversity factor but watch it because it is a fun movie, a solid, one time watch to be honest.",6
" A mixed bag
","I wanted to like this movie. I like all three iterations of Blue Beetle. The lead actor was good, but he seemed to be acting in a different movie than the members of his family. In a few scenes, they acted like they were all on meth. I find their behavior less believable than a guy getting possessed by a beetle alien. I like George Lopez, but his character couldn't have been a bigger stereotype unless he was running around in a bee costume for the whole move. It's also funny that they make a point about Jaime not wanting to kill anyone, because he was the only character that had any issue with it, whatsoever; even Ted Kord carried a goddamn gatling gun around with him in his incredibly user-friendly arsenal. The antagonist was basically Obadiah Stane split into two people. I contemplated whether I was giving away any spoilers, but I think that's almost impossible if you watch it for five minutes.",5
" BeetleMania
","Another film in what remains a weird time for DC. ""Blue Beetle"" seems to have the support of the 'Gunn Safran' era but wasn't commissioned by them, so who knows whether this is a one-off appearance or whether we might see the Blue Beetle again.<br><br>Jamie Reyes (Xolo Mariduena) a young man of Hispanic descent, is chosen by an item of alien origin to become a superhero, the Blue Beetle. As well as the power of flight and enhanced body armour, the suit is capable of producing weapons and forms a symbiotic relationship with its host. The item though is wanted by weapons manufacturer Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) for her enhanced soldier programme, and she's prepared to use her considerable resources to reclaim the talisman.<br><br>""Blue Beetle"" is, for me, another film in what can be described as the DCEU's perfectly fine goodbye. Like ""Black Adam"" and ""Shazam 2"" ""Blue Beetle"" is an acceptable time, which is both the films best and worst points. There are specific aspects that I do like, Xolo Mariduena is an engaging performer, just like he is in ""Cobra Kai"". I liked his family too, even George Lopez, who looked like he'd be insufferable in the trailer is actually a lot funnier and more heartwarming than he appeared. Visually it's OK, with the CGI looking solid and the fight scenes working well.<br><br>But ultimately, it's another superhero origin story like so many others before it. Whilst it avoids Reyes trying to keep his double life from his parents, it does include, for example, scenes of him struggling with his newfound powers, which we've seen before. Any of the ideas that might have been interesting or unique about this one, such as the fact that the actual power is sentient and can make its own decisions about what to do, are largely underexplored. Also, the Neon 80's vibes felt, to me, a little played out in a post ""Vice City"", ""Stranger Things"" world.<br><br>I can't imagine that really the film is going to draw particularly strong reactions, either positive or negative from anyone. It's too slick to hate, but too generic to love - if we see the character again, I'd probably see the film, but I see him shifting into a supporting role in team up films, going forward.",6

Dan Garrett was the first Blue Beetle with Ted Kord being the second and Jaime Reyes being the current one. Xolo plays Jaime, a young college graduate looking for a job. Susan plays Victoria Kord-Ted's sister-that now runs Kord Industries and is looking for an alien artifact called a scarab. Bruna plays Ted's daughter that wants to run the company like her missing father wanted her to do-on the up and up-and not like her aunt Susan is doing. George plays Xolo's uncle that is also pretty good with computers and engineering. Susan finds her scarab but Xolo gets a hold of it and it bonds with him-it's sentient-and Xolo and the scarab become symbiotic, with the scarab becoming a suit of armor around it's host and giving Xolo all kinds of powers. It's pretty standard, as far as plotwise; Susan wants the scarab back and Xolo wants to protect his family. There is plenty of humor, mostly from Xolo's grandmother and George. George likes a Mexican super hero called El Chapulin Colorado-The Cherry Cricket-who makes a couple of appearances, one of which is after the end credits. There is also a scene just as the end credits start concerning one of the other two Blue Beetles.<br><br>It's rated PG-13 for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 7 minutes.<br><br>It's not the worst super hero movie I've seen but it seemed like it could have been a little better, maybe story wise.

" A not-bad superhero origin story, but we desperately need newness in this genre! [+59%]
","As yet another superhero origin story, Blue Beetle sticks to the basics and mostly gets them right. While the set pieces and the villainy didn't surprise me much, I enjoyed the ground-level combat the most (wish there was more to that!). A major chunk of the action takes place in the air and (of course, the titular superhero is a ""beetle"" after all), and that's where I felt it could've been executed better. The suit and its internal AI will definitely remind you of various other superhero flicks. Xolo Maridueña plays a likeable protagonist and shares decent chemistry with Bruna Marquezine.<br><br>The makers did a good job embedding the Mexican family dynamics into the plot, which not only gave it a distinct setup, but the emotional payoffs also worked well. Jaime's relationship with each of his family members is neatly explored, especially the one he shares with Uncle Rudy (George Lopez). The revolutionary nana bit was a fun little surprise. On the other hand, the Kord side of things was rather unexciting and didn't feel very engaging. Susan Sarandon gets to play a baddie, but I thought her backstory wasn't given a whole lot of importance. Also, they should've added hardcoded subs for the Spanish dialogues.<br><br>The thing with superhero films (for me, personally i.e.) is that they're extremely CGI-heavy, and since I've had my fill of them for more than a decade now, I feel disengaged whenever I'm seeing one of those green-screen set-pieces.

" An Uninspiring Superhero Movie that is plain lazy story

It's tempting to write this off as just another DC B-team dud, but the fact is that the fare coming from Marvel these days is just as weak.

He speaks Spanish!) is just insulting, because it's the same old tired storyline dressed up in slightly different clothes.<br><br>Studios need to wise up. Marvel lucked out over a decade ago, but there's no point racing for that bus today - it's left long ago. There have been a few examples of people trying to do something genuinely creative or entertaining with the superhero genre, but studios keep chickening out.

The story follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a young man who gets superpowers after discovering an alien scarab in a takeaway container he was meant to guard with his life. The plot is engaging and well-paced, with enough twists and turns to keep me interested. Maridueña delivers a standout performance, and his character's journey of self-discovery and acceptance is one of the movie's strongest aspects. Other characters are well-developed and relatable. Each one has their own unique personality and motivations.<br><br>Angel Manuel Soto, the director, brings a fresh and unique perspective to the superhero genre - which is a relief given the many ""template"" superhero movies we've had over the years. Blue Beetle is visually stunning, with some truly breathtaking shots. The score and soundtrack are excellent, and the cinematography is top-notch. The special effects are also excellent, with the alien scarab and Jaime's superpowers being particularly impressive. The dialogue is well-written and engaging, with some memorable lines. The scarab's interactions with Jaime provide some of the movie's funniest and most memorable moments. The editing is also excellent, and everything flows smoothly from scene to scene.<br><br>Blue Beetle explores themes of family, identity, and the immigrant experience, which are rarely explored in superhero movies. Blue Beetle handles them with sensitivity and nuance. Mexican culture is presented with little fanfare or explanation, which is a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood approach of exoticising or stereotyping other cultures. And Jaime's family, the Reyes family, is a central part of the movie, with Jaime's relationship with his parents and younger sister providing a solid emotional core.<br><br>Blue Beetle is a fun and engaging superhero movie that delivers on all fronts.",8
" An excellent Latin superhero movie
","DC Comics has featured many superheroes from their universe and even though Blue Beetle has been around for a long time and is not that well known, this movie presents him with a lot of freshness. Xolo Maridueña has gained great popularity for playing Miguel Diaz in the Cobra Kai series and now as he offers his second best role in the role of Blue Beetle. It has very good special effects as usual in superhero movies and a very good balance of action and humor. The strongest point in favor of this film would be its way of representing Latino people. In fact, the film becomes a good combination of superhero cinema and Latino cinema. It has a couple of references and tributes to the world of Latin entertainment through the songs used in the soundtrack and some fragments of Mexican productions. Many of the leads are empathetic and charismatic, especially Uncle Rudy Reyes, played by George Lopez. He knows how to raise the issue of the community in the United States very well in a quite natural way. In fact, the movie feels Latino enough to take its place alongside movies like Coco, El Mariachi, Cronos, Encanto, and Machete. Definitely, Blue Beetle is one of the best movies of 2023 and a great gift for the Latin American community. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.",10

Visual Effects for CGI was pretty good and so well done, and so glad it's not all that goofy like this year's The Flash did. The Flash (2023) had messy goofy CGI effects and it was not that enjoyable, like Blue Beetle is.<br><br>Xolo Maridueña, from the number 1 hit show: ""Cobra Kai"", did an amazing job with his performance and he's a super star of the show, and let's not forget the number 1 comedian: George Lopez!

From the guy getting possessed by a beetle, followed by the mysterious backstory of this beetle, and then he's just like Spider-Man, starting off awkward and then merging to become super powerful. Even though it all matches the expectations, the most surprising thing I saw in the theater was the fake Iron Man. Of course, the real Iron Man, after three movies, we know all about his weapons and strengths. Without giving away too much, I can definitely recommend the part where this happens as the highlight to watch in the theater. The rest is kind of dull, you can imagine Spider-Man's copyright still being with Sony, so introducing a similar new hero is understandable. I bet there'll be loads of Blue Beetle merchandise hitting the shelves soon.",8

","This is a typical super hero movie with absolutely nothing special to differentiate it from any other super hero movie. Take your choice: Iron Man, Spider Man, whatever-man... Blue Beetle is just more of the same.<br><br>The emphasis on family is great, but a lot of that is spoiled by the excessive amount of un-translated Spanish in the movie. Almost 50% of the dialog is like this. Seriously, that's nonsense.<br><br>The Blue Beetle himself is pretty much an Iron Man clone. I'm not talking about the comic book, I'm talking about the movie. The suit is blue instead of red and yellow. Big woop.<br><br>All in all, not impressed. If you need an adrenaline rush this *might* suffice.

","Blue Beetle is a decent superhero movie which would have made a bigger impact if it was released several years ago.

" nice superhero
","My Summary:
watched it in IMAX and it did feel good for sure since I'm hearing/watching this superhero for the first time, the entire film was nicely made except for the family drama part which felt like a cliche and the boring drama of family coming to save a superhero was the most draggy part, removing that part alone from the movie would've made this one a racy entertainer.<br><br>Overall, it was a good one-time watchable superhero fictional drama.<br><br>ChatGPT Summary:
I had the opportunity to watch this film in IMAX, and the experience was undeniably enjoyable. As someone who was encountering this particular superhero for the first time, the overall cinematic experience was satisfying. However, despite its many merits, the film does have a few drawbacks that are worth mentioning.<br><br>One of the film's strongest attributes is its overall production quality. The entire movie is well-crafted, boasting impressive visuals, engaging action sequences, and a captivating storyline. For a viewer who is new to this superhero's world, the film serves as an excellent introduction, immersing them in a visually stunning and immersive cinematic universe.<br><br>The film's ability to draw the audience into this superhero's world and maintain their interest throughout is a testament to its well-executed storytelling. The pacing of the narrative, the character development, and the integration of various elements of the superhero mythos all contribute to a cohesive and engaging viewing experience.<br><br>However, there is one notable aspect of the film that detracts from its overall quality. The inclusion of a family drama subplot feels somewhat clichéd and, at times, drags down the film's momentum. The idea of family coming to the rescue of a superhero is a familiar trope in the genre, and in this instance, it comes across as a somewhat uninspired narrative choice.<br><br>Had the film omitted this family drama subplot, it might have been a more streamlined and thrilling cinematic experience. The absence of this particular storyline could have allowed the film to focus more squarely on the superhero's journey, his challenges, and his growth, which are often the most compelling aspects of such narratives.<br><br>Nonetheless, it's important to note that the film still manages to deliver a satisfying one-time watchable superhero fictional drama. While the family drama element may not have been a highlight, it doesn't entirely overshadow the film's strengths. The superhero's journey, the world-building, and the action sequences are more than enough to keep audiences engaged and entertained.<br><br>In conclusion, my IMAX experience with this film was undoubtedly enjoyable, particularly as a first-time introduction to this superhero. The film succeeds in many aspects, offering impressive visuals and a well-crafted storyline. However, the inclusion of a clichéd family drama subplot does detract from the overall experience and results in moments of drag. Nevertheless, it remains a solid one-time watch for fans of superhero fiction, showcasing the potential for a thrilling and entertaining cinematic journey if certain narrative elements were refined.",5
" The villain isn't very compelling.
","IN A NUTSHELL:
An alien scarab beetle chooses Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the recent college graduate with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle.<br><br>The film was directed by Angel Manuel Soto, and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.<br><br>THINGS I LIKED:
I first noticed Xolo Mariduena in the Netflix TV show Cobra Kai where he does a fantastic job. He's excellent in this role and has a very bright future. I'm so happy for him and for his success. His character features a scrappy, naïve element to the Superhero genre, much like Spider-Man has done for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br><br>Other cast members include Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon, comedian George Lopez, Harvey Guillen, Belissa Escobedo, Adriana Barraza, Damian Alcazar, Becky G, Elpidia Carillo, Bruna Marquezine, and Raoul Max Trujillo. They all do a great job by clearly defining distinct characters. The grandma character is awesome and hilarious.<br><br>DC Studios CEO James Gunn ultimately decided that the Blue Beetle character would be disconnected from the DC Universe. That being said, we see the name ""Lexcorp"" on a tower from the Superman movies. We also see Jaime wearing a Gotham Law hoodie from the Batman movies.<br><br>Final Fantasy video game fans will get a kick out of the scene when Jaime creates the Buster Sword as his weapon of choice.<br><br>We're introduced to Mexican culture. The Latino population will love seeing one of their own featured as a superhero! One of the Hispanic characters dies, something that the DC studio pushed for in order to make it more emotional. Angel Manuel Soto didn't want to do that but later saw it as an opportunity to share how the Mexican culture views death.<br><br>Family is at the heart of this movie. It's what gives the film both a soul and humor.<br><br>Humor has been one of the magical elements to the success of Marvel movies and where DC movies have failed, for the most part. This movie taps into the natural humor of a Mexican family and gives it all of the charm DC needed to level up to Marvel.<br><br>The town of Palmera City is fictitious, much like Gotham City.<br><br>Fun fact #1: Roberto Gomez, son of the original Chapulin actor Roberto Gomez Bolanos voices a radio transmission in this movie.<br><br>The film has a lot of entertaining Easter eggs to look for. For example, in Spanish, we hear someone announce on the TV that ""Bruce Wayne Bought Twitter."" Ha ha I remember seeing ""Sabado Gigante"" on TV when I sailed through the channels. In one scene in this movie, we see it playing on the TV in the background.<br><br>This is the 14th movie in the DC Extended Universe.<br><br>One element that I really loved was when the Blue Beetle is able to truly understand a bad guy's unique perspective. Hurt people hurt. If only we all took the time to understand, rather than judge and react without the full story.<br><br>Keep watching during the rolling credits for another scene.<br><br>THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Because of Xolo Mariduena's work in Cobra Kai, we know that he has some serious karate skills, yet they were, sadly, underutilized in this movie. His physicality and skills could have been a real highlight. He's not much of a superhero throughout most of the movie, but just bumbles his way through fights and, most of the time, gets beat up or tries to run away.<br><br>So much CGI.<br><br>So much screaming.<br><br>The villain isn't very compelling.<br><br>It's extremely cliched with wooden dialogue.<br><br>Very predictable.<br><br>Sometimes, the Blue Beetle suit's robot capabilities work but other times it's silent and doesn't seem to help. I didn't understand the inconsistencies.<br><br>TIPS FOR PARENTS:
A lot of Spanish is spoken with subtitles.<br><br>There is a surprising amount of profanity in English and Spanish.<br><br>Superhero fighting
Lots of destruction
Talk of a parent who died in the past
Someone in the family dies a sad, unexpected death.<br><br>Some blood splatters.<br><br>We see a flashback of a child kidnapping.<br><br>Bug farts.<br><br>To see my full review, check out my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!",8
" Breath of Fresh Air after So Many Bad DC Movies
","*Extremely minor spoilers ahead*<br><br>It's no surprise that DC movies have been extremely hit or miss recently, with The Flash being one of the biggest disappointments in cinema history. However, this movie was finally a hit for the DC universe and really surprised me.<br><br>Coming into this movie, I had heard decent things about it so I kept my expectations neutral and went in with an open mind. And by the end, I walked out happy, knowing that I just saw, finally, a really good DC movie. Keep in mind this movie is not for everyone, and gets pretty generic at times, but overall, it's pretty solid.<br><br>The plot revolves around Jaime Reyes, a 22 year old man who just graduated and went home to his Mexican family. His family has strong love for each other, and they're all really funny. After learning they're in debt, he wants to get a job to help his family. He eventually meets a young woman named Jennifer Kord, who is a descendant of Ted Kord, the owner of Kord Industries, a tech company. After meeting, she tells him that if he wants a job, then he should meet her at Kord Tower the next day. When he shows up, he finds Jenny running from law enforcement. When Jaime asks what's wrong, she gives him a case with a special Scarab in it and tells him to protect and not open it. When he returns home, his goofy family tries to convince him to open it, so he does. A Blue Beetle hops out and attaches to Jaime, transforming him into the ultimate weapon.<br><br>The rest of the movie involves Jenny Kord's aunt attempting to retrieve the Beetle from Jaime and his family, with the help of a hardened soldier in a tech suit, similar to Jamie's. The villain is probably the weakest part of the movie, and her voice acting is really monotone. Her motivations are also really cliche and overused, but the way the movie plays out turns it into something unique.<br><br>The movie turns into a beautiful story about family and family dynamics, and the Reyes all have incredible love for each other. In my opinion, that's where the movie succeeds the most, as the Reyes are really sweet and absolutely hilarious, especially George Lopez' Uncle Rudy. It's a breath of fresh air with some amazing action and an even more amazing sense of humor and emotion. I really recommend this movie; it's heartwarming, epic, and really, really funny. Really the only thing the movie fails at is making a legitimate motivation for the main villain other than ""money!!! Power!!! Corporate stuff!!""
Overall, it's a 9/10, would recommend :)<br><br>Oh and also the main theme song is epic :)",9
" The Coolest Bug In DC-Town
","One of the oldest DC heroes gets the heritage treatment in ""Blue Beetle"". The movie exceeded expectations and delivered fantastic high-octane action deserving of a hero with such a gilded comic-book pedigree.<br><br>The story went back to the roots of this hero's lore. An off-world scarab was unearthed and, in almost Green Lantern fashion, found and chose Jaime Reyes as its symbiotic host in classic Venom style. Though he was only a college graduate, the all-purpose multi-capability suit granted him mind-boggling powers just a simple visualization and vocal request away.<br><br>Xolo Maridueña's performance as Jaime Reyes was a perfect fit for this hero. He balanced trend appeal, vulnerability, humanity, and familial love in ways that did the role justice. Xolo also brought such contagious energy to the screen that it was hard to look away each time he came into focus.<br><br>All the family members, especially grandma Reyes (played by Adriana Barraza) and Rudy Reyes (played by George Lopez) did stellar work in this goosebumps-guaranteed movie from DC Studios. Jaime Reyes' family became heroes without capes, in a way.<br><br>Khaji-Da (by Becky G) as the Scarab-Suit system voice was amazing. Though they under-used his character, it was nice to see Harvey Guillén (as Jose Francisco Morales Rivera de la Cruz) being his naturally comedic self.<br><br>Special shout-out to Susan Sarandon whom I have always enjoyed watching on screen. She did remarkable work as the heartless power-hungry and money-grabbing Victoria Kord. For the first time since Bane (played by Tom Hardy), they gave us a well-written villain who was monstrously human.<br><br>On a related note, Victoria's goon Carapax (played by Raoul Max Trujillo) took me by surprise in a lot of ways. They could've done more with this character, but no matter, the plot still flowed strong.<br><br>I also liked what Jenny Kord (played by Bruna Marquezine) brought to the script, to say nothing of that underground Kord Estate 'lair' where answers lay in wait. Apparently, her father Ted Kord was the original Blue Beetle.<br><br>The wonderful ways in which they captured Spanish culture and wove it around a Hispanic superhero was admirable. I was glad to see DC didn't 'white wash' things when it came to properly depicting Jaime Reyes. This is, after all, a hero as old as Batman; by comic book reckoning. I loved that Superman-and-Lois-Lane moment Jenny and he shared near the finale.<br><br>I liked the emotional angle they wove into the plot, particularly between Jaime and his father. We couldn't see a lot of that with Batman's parents in DC, because he was a kid when they were murdered. But here, much like Marvel's Spider-Man, DC gave us a hero in his 20s who lost a parent. This created plenty of room for immediately relatable sadness as opposed to Batsie's years-long psychological trauma.<br><br>Every single element of Jaime Reyes' 'scarab suit' was *chef's kiss*. It was a gold - or rather blue - standard in costume design, one that carried over the original look from the comics. It was great to see a suit that genuinely felt desirable. Anyone will want one, that's how amazing the super-suit was in ""Blue Beetle"".<br><br>Some suit functions almost resembled the workings of a Tesla Neuralink (fully implantable brain computer interface). And don't get me started on Ted's 'Beetle Plane' and Victoria's military OMAC (One Man Army Corp) systems. Their designs were compelling in so many ways that may well be real and in use today. The Scarab-suit was already integrated with an ancient A. I., namely Khaji-Da.<br><br>Scintillating VFX and engaging synthwave further enriched ""Blue Beetle"" and made this classic superhero feel real and rooted. The story was simple but packed great visual value. I loved all the action choreography, it had a curious Capoeira style to it.<br><br>When you truly think about it, much of the designs used in the movie came from the original comics, which themselves go back decades in lore. It was therefore curious for me to see so many nifty ideas that today hold ample relevance in the Metaverse.<br><br>Being able to create whatever you can imagine is something people have been doing using blockchain technology these past few years. Just like the tech-driven Scarab, maybe the future of the Metaverse will have its own digital Blue Beetle superheroes flying all over the space.<br><br>And seeing as how wars, rather cyberwars, are being fought in digital realms, perhaps the Blue Beetle 'invincible solider' concept may be closer to reality than we think.<br><br>Now imagine if soldiers armed with such advanced tech suddenly stopped fighting, turned to face their respective politicians, and said, ""No more wars, we will protect both sides."" A new unified military order may soon prevail and govern the globe, thus ushering in the alien race who created and perhaps divulged this information to us purely so they could use the 'system' to enslave humankind, thus revealing themselves to be the real puppet-masters and us the gullible and greedy species that fell for the oldest trick in the alien-book, namely power through technology . The house always wins, indeed. I can almost hear the Scarab beetle tittering with glee.",9

" Fun... But that's not enough in a 2023 superhero movie
","It's all just too similar. Even though this movie is fun, and is generally well done. It feels like DC went from being very original and eventually controversial, to then scared to do anything too daring or bold, and kept everything within the ""safe"" box. And that's just not going to cut it if you want people to leave the theater with a spark.<br><br>I'm honestly surprised and pretty disappointed that DC is still releasing these three movies this year after telling the whole world that they don't matter. Firstly, people aren't going to see them but more importantly in my eyes, people are losing any kind of respect or value in what the brand of DC has to offer.<br><br>Moving forward, bring some compelling writing, and serious threat that audiences grab ahold of.

Very family friendly and something that all group ages will adore.<br><br>Love the family aspect of this film and showcases a great representation of mexican neighbourhood, life and their struggles as well as some of the mexican cultures. Very light hearted movie full with thrilling actions and comedy. Few romance scenes and sad scenes.<br><br>Not familiar with Xolo from the karate kids but he was definitely the heart of this film. Very compelling acting skills. The villains were a bit on the weaker side but some of the cast were a bit miss for me. The cgi sometimes were awful but judging from the budget, i will give it a pass.<br><br>Love the world building aspect and felt like i want more of it. Great scores, the audio/sound effects were amazing. Had a great imax experience. Hope it does well at the box office despite having a great superhero fatigue. Recommended.",7
" A Superhero Movie that Deserves Watching
","In Blue Beetle, everything deserves praise. The story and the themes it deals with (family and its importance), performances of the cast, especially the ones of Mariduena and Trujillo, soundtrack, emotional weight, visual and sound effects, action scenes, cinematography, which focuses on the blue and the purple color, direction, screenplay, and ending, which sets up a future for the character in the DC Universe, were all excellent and have nothing to be said againt them.<br><br>Regarding the flaws, to be honest, I couldn't find any flaws in the movie except for some story elements that their origin and background was not explained. Other than that, everything else was nearly perfect. That is why when it comes to the score, I gladly give Blue Beetle 9 out of 10.",9
" I am truly touched.
","I loved it. I am truly touched and grateful for the Hispanic representation, it truly made me feel seen. It was long overdue and it was well done. In most DC movies, we have only been the help in the kitchens or as gang members...so thank you for giving a better depiction...Family is everything for my culture, as well as finding purpose and creating meaning in life. It was genuinely authentic. Well-done to everyone! I will be buying it as soon as it is available. And I will be going back to the theater to watch it again soon. Thank you to everyone for putting this together, and fantastic job with the musical selection and score.",10
" I actually had a lot of fun here
","The reviews I saw initially pointed out the ethnicity of the character or characters. It seemed like that was all they really wanted to harp on. Well if you can't figure out that much from previews than why did you even sit through it?<br><br>As I'm watching this, I'm wondering what Robert Rodriguez could have done with this movie. He had a string of decent movies involving comic book characters and even started his own franchise in the very fun movie Spy Kids.<br><br>After the disappointment of those other marvel movies like Shazam and that God awful Black Adam, this was a refreshing surprise with its humor and heart. The kid from Cobra Kai leads the way among a group of veteran actors and comedians to make a fun 2hr and 6 minute movie.<br><br>The blue beetle itself is some sort of relic when hosted with the chosen person it wants, that person possesses all the strength of their imagination. George Lopez in a supporting role lends to some creative inventions and is the backbone of its sense of humor. I've got to say this was a refreshing take on those cheesy other DC movies that have come out because this one is actually good. Above all, I recommend this one because this the kind of superhero movie all those other DC disappointments should have been. Although I do have one question: if anyone can be a superhero now, does that mean we can be stuck with that awful Conan O'Brien trying don a cape now?? God I sure hope not. ****1/2 of *****",10
" Probably the worst superhero movie I've seen.
","There are decent special effects. But the story is boring and most of the characters are extremely annoying. Nothing makes sense. It feels like a parody more than a superhero movie. Like the deadbeat Uncle that drives a $60,000 Tacoma with a picnic table for a spoiler that sleeps on the couch as the whole family complains about living in the slums. The guy could sell his truck and buy three of their houses. Not to mention he somehow afford to make some generator garbage tech in the back of his truck that disables the security system for a multi million dollar tech company. So suddenly, this deadbeat is a genius. Several sections go into full Spanish with no subtitles. Not that you're missing much because by that point you're already thinking what I'm thinking we're just waiting for the credits to roll. I couldn't even finish it.",1
" Blue Beetle's Film Debut
","First Black Adam, now it's Blue Beetle's turn to introduce the movie goers that often watch superhero movies. And the results, it does make the most of the material for the character. Blue Beetle is a decent origin movie for the character. The first half of the movie can be basic with the ""family issues"" aspect and the characters don't really provide a lot of personality. But the rest of the movie gotten better with stunning visuals that experiments Blue Beetle's abilities nicely, enjoyable action, and great performances that make the movie quite entertaining. Because it's rare to see Blue Beetle in other form of media outside of comics, this probably will be the one movie goers would get introduced to the character. So maybe this would be worth watching either that or even as a DC fan. I wouldn't consider this as one of DCEU's best movies, but they did a pretty good job making an origin for the character.",7
" Cerita yang tidak masuk akal dan banyak membosankan
","The first impression that comes from this film is ""how is that possible?"" Almost in every scene. How could someone with no talent and who knows where suddenly be chosen as a super hero? The scene of his family being able to use weapons also gives the impression of ""how is that possible"", very unnatural and seems forced. The criminal who suddenly became good just by remembering moments from his family, he himself said that it was his feeling of pity for his family that made him weak, and he also did it. Moreover, the villain loses when he has great power, which is really strange. Jennifer's character also looks ""pretentious"", too superior even though she can't do anything big. This film is more like Fast &amp; Furious which prioritizes its family.",2

" Too Preachy
","Yes, too preachy. From the beginning, Blue Beetle was full of preaching about family, Latino principles, values, etc. When I watched it, it immediately gave the feeling of custom order film. Producers dictated what they want to see in the movie, copied scenes from other movies and even lines to be said by actors. Coz the director met the majority of the dictation, the movie felt disjointed and forced in most scenes.<br><br>George Lopez was clearly recruited to save the film sensibility by throwing jokes and comments. He kinda lifted the film a little, so it was watchable as a TV Series pilot. Blue Beetle was, IMHO, a TV Pilot. It would replace Arrowverse that finally ended after a decade. It would also the opportunity to build the new generation of Jistice League, considering Blue Beetle and Booster Gold are famously JL members.<br><br>The good news is Blue Beetle is watchable. The bad news is nothing memorable in the film.",3

","Just caught BlueBeetle in its dazzling debut! James Gunn's DC Universe kicks off with a bang, serving up an exciting and expertly crafted origin story that's anything but ordinary. From introducing a fresh hero to a wide audience to weaving in Mexican culture, language, and music, this film nails it! Prepare for some intense themes that'll get you talking.<br><br>Xolo Mariduñea brilliantly lights up his character (Jamie Reyes/ Blue Beetle ) creating space for the supporting cast to embrace a delightful comedic charm. A special nod goes out to George Lopez (Rudy Reyes) , Belissa Escobedo (Milagro Reyes), and Adriana Barraza (Nana Reyes) for crafting moments of pure and authentic laughter.<br><br>Key elements sought in an origin story are effectively met: authenticity that resonates with the character, growth as the hero navigates new-found powers , heartache , and a burgeoning romantic interest with Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezina). The portrayal of the love interest is captivating, rooted in the concept of Familia , and resonates with profound emotional chords. Certain scenes may evoke tears from viewers.<br><br>In the end, Blue Beetle presents a startling and remarkable cinematic experience. It is certainly worth watching. Regardless of whether one is an avid superhero enthusiast, anyone with a Mexican background will embrace this narrative. I rate Blue Beetle a solid 4 out of 5.",8
" Poor, elementary writing/cliches out the wazoo.

Something written that simple and ridiculous let's you know what to expect the rest of the way. Cliche characters, crazy uncle, struggling family, story flaw after story flaw. I am encouraged however, it seems DC visually went for a Marvel look. I believe the Meta Score is 6.1/10. In academic terms that a 61% which is a D- That seems appropriate. Not quite an F, but close.

" Another average superhero origin story
","What it does well is have a strong cast with a great main lead of Xolo Mariduena as Jamie Reyes. The costume department and designers also did a terrific job on the suit. When you see it practically, it looks like they brought the suit from the comics to life. There are also some very fun and well-choreographed action scenes.<br><br>Unfortunately, the writing is just not up to par and suffers from all the cliche tropes of origin movies. The first act is a drag to get through with its slow pacing and the writing for the family dynamic is not funny. The plot is predictable and the villain is another entry in the same as good guy but evil! There is also many question about plot points such as how Jamie is against killing but is okay for others to do it.<br><br>Overall, it's a fine movie to kill 2 hours with and at least it's better than the previous DC entries.",6
" An isolated film with good and bad qualities
","I am only minimally familliar with the Blue Beetle through past super hero animated shows on Cartoon Network. So i only had a rough idea and watched this film out of interest for the character.<br><br>My real opinion on this movie consists of only two words:<br><br>All right.<br><br>That's it, it was exciting to see a new character in the big screens besides all of the familliar faces we have seen across years. What makes this movie unique, is its focus on the importance of family love. While very basic, I felt high levels of affection and a sense of comfort.<br><br>Mexican Heritage or not, there were a lot of heart warming loving moments where I thought it would be nice to be that close to your family. Plus the humor wasn't too bad, it was just right.<br><br>My issue with the movie strikes on the story and bad guys being the same as usual. Everyone here understands the concept of secret evil organization weaponizing stuff, yet that was the wrong choice here. It could of been any other direction besides this and the film would of been so much better.",7
" A deserved addition to the world of super Heroes...!!!
","Its mexicans turn to bring a superhero subject on silver screen that exceeds the expectations...
The major strength of the flick is that masterfully hits the emotional note &amp; family values constantly...
While director skillfully manages the diversity of superhero subject without breaking the stereotype legacy...
The heart pounding action sequences with an Amazing sound track easily beats the vfx work of THE FLASH effortlessly
A must watch theatrical material and xolo mariduena does an excellant job in titular characters bringing out charm and charisms ie universally accepted...
Few dialogues are meant to connect ur love towards the family in every ways...",7
" Its simple but I expected that
","Its everything you would expect from an origin story, it feels kinda formulaic at times and not all the jokes land but at the end of the day, I went to watch this with all my family and we had a good time, we did laugh at some of the jokes, we enjoyed the story and liked some of the action scenes. Its definitely not the type of movie you will remember after a month but it delivers at entertaining you for an hour. So while I expected just a little more out of this movie, I dont feel dissapointed at all. I still have hopes for the DCU and this movie I think probes that they can still give enjoyable little fun stories out there, they just need to make them better with more time and planning.",7
" worse than shazam and black adam. Is this movie for children to watch?
","I thought the above 2 movies were the worst until I saw this movie :))
The plot is bad, one-color, too predictable, I could already imagine how the movie would play out after just watching the first few minutes. The main character is stupid, weak, needs an event to strengthen him, there are too many of this type of plot. 2023 Does DC still think many people will like this type of movie?. The power of friendship, the power of family is like a Japanese shounen.<br><br>What is the villain's motive?. What a terrible movie.<br><br>I spent 2 hours watching this nonsense. I think DC should go make doll movies for children to watch, it will probably reduce losses in future movies :))",1
" Awesome!
","Some of these bad reviews are just laugh out loud laughable. It's so obvious that some of these people haven't even watched the movie. I even read one that said the CGI was bad! Now that in itself is proof that that particular has not actually seen the movie, because the CGI is actually near flawless. It was probably some of the best CGI I've seen in recent years. It's so frustrating that people review bomb particular movies based on which comic book studio they originate from!<br><br>Anyways, back to my review. It was action packed, heartfelt and funny. The characters were all very likeable and cast well. My only criticism is that it went on a little longer than it needed to, but that's what all comic book movies do.",9
" Children's TV
","I went into this with optimism. I was wrong, as previously mentioned in other reviews, this is a very childish film that portrays a very poor story. I only watched to the end because I bought it through the sky store. Normally with DC and Marvel I would watch this type of film several times ( even using the Subtitles to further understand) but in afraid this film will never be revisited as there is nothing really to understand. You could start watching it and leave the room for 15 minutes and you would not lose the plot. It's one for the kids. This is not a thinkers film, give it a miss and save disappoint.",2
" Rather boring and George Lopez was anoying
","Movie overall was boring and predictable. Acting was ok expect for George Lopez. His over the top Mexican stereotype was annoying every time he was on scene. Now like him as a stand up comedian but in this movie he was horrible. His over the top performance and utter disgusting stereotype was funny for all of 2 seconds before it annoyed the crap out of us.<br><br>The plot of the movie is your regular superhero vs bad guy story. Rich bad family trying to monopolize an army to gain power. Only to be taken down by some family and a niece with the help of the scare of course. Now I've never heard of the blue beetle before so this world is all new to me, coming from fresh eyes.",5
" Bored and a waste of time
","It's always fun when a new sci-fi/superhero movie comes out. I always try to view them if I can find the time. This film in particular did not entertain me and in fact kept me wondering how much longer. The acting and the storyline were not very good in my opinion. Maybe that's why I feel this movie would have better suited a child, not even a teenager. There were cheesy lines throughout the film which made me think that possibly George Lopez wrote some of it. The character development was good however, it was predictable. Good guy versus bad guy. Bored and a waste of time. I would not recommend this film to the next movie watcher.",5
" I wanted to like it but that dialogue...
",Weird cross between spiderman/ironman but the dialogue is rough and there are so many stereotypes and tropes that it felt very far from genuine.<br><br>I thought Xolo did an ok job as the lead character but he was cut short by too much involvement from side characters. This device added humor but left all the characters shallow and made it hard to deeply connect with any of them.<br><br>After that there was a lot of stereotype humor and jabs that just didn't land.<br><br>The story was also pretty predictable. On a positive note the action was fun if you enjoyed iron man/spiderman. I wouldn't sign up to watch a sequel.,4
" Family
","Ramario Xolo Ramirez, famously known as the Blue Beetle, returns to his hometown only to find that his family is on the brink of losing their home due to financial difficulties, involving his mother, grandmother, uncle, and sister.<br><br>As for the villains in this story, something seems off. They come across as rather lackluster, with Susan Sarandon's portrayal falling short of true intimidation, portraying only a hint of cold-heartedness. Surprisingly, her bodyguard exudes a more imposing presence.<br><br>In contrast to the apparent emphasis on being a badass hero, it's refreshing to see the true heroes emerge within the Ramirez family. Blue Beetle's attempt at adopting a Batman, Iron Man, or Ant-Man persona might feel a tad excessive.<br><br>Among the characters, Grandma stands out with her resilience and fighting spirit, and George Lopez does justice to the role of a supportive uncle. Ultimately, Blue Beetle offers an enjoyable superhero movie experience, though it may follow a somewhat familiar superhero plot formula seen in many other films.",7

" Good But Not Great
","Blue Beetle like many DC movies suffers from a storyline that just can't bring it full circle. It is not bad however and I did enjoy it flaws and all.<br><br>The story focuses on young Jamie who is getting a degree in law, but comes home to see his family and finds out they are struggling so he quits his studies to work and keep his family afloat. He and his sister are working at Victoria Kord's house cleaning when they overhear Jenny Kord her niece and her fighting. They are discovered by Victoria and end up getting fired however Jenny realizing that she has inadvertently costed them their job gives her number to Jamie and tells him to come meet her for a job the following day. What follows is the adventure of Jamie going from poor boy to superhero and eventually boyfriend.<br><br>The movie as I said doesn't have an impressive storyline that will blow your mind away, however it's story is good enough and will keep you entertained. It has all the usual tropes like bad guy finding redemption, the guy getting the girl at the end etc. What makes it entertaining though is the dynamic between Blue Beetle/Jamie and his family as well as his interactions with Jenny Kord and the Scarab suit aka Khaji-Da.<br><br>In terms of casting I haven't read the comics so I don't know how accurate to the source material the casting is. Jamie is played by Xolo Maridueña who is both good looking and seems like a pretty good actor considering this is the first performance of his I've seen. Jenny Kord is played by the absolutely beautiful Bruna Marquezine who kills it and steals every scene she is in, definitely a great casting choice there. Jamie's sister Mila played by Belissa Escobedo is a good supporting character who brings just enough comic relief along with her with witty remarks here and there. Rudy played by George Lopez is the cool uncle who actually seems to know the most when it comes to the Blue Beetle and making cool gadgets and contraptions. The final shoutout for acting has to go to Jamies grandmother Nana played by Adriana Barraza who turns out to be a complete badass later on when she is strategizing like she is in the mafia and handle a minigun like she was born with one in her hands.<br><br>In terms of VFX and SFX well it's a big budget DC film so they're really good. The soundtracks are nice and the effects of the Scarab and the blue beetle suit are pretty great. No complaints from me here.<br><br>Overall Blue Beetle is not bad, it has a decent storyline though nothing mind-blowing or out of this world but it is still entertaining and that's what is important in the end. The cast as I said is pretty great and so are the visuals and audio. So overall a well deserved 7/10 from me. If you like superhero movies or are a DC fan definitely give Blue Beetle a chance and I'm sure you'll like it.",7
" I was Wrong...!
","Let me start by saying the 1st Blue Beetle (Dan Garret) was an A-List hero in the 40's to the mid 50's; the 2nd Blue Beetle was a B-List hero (and my favorite); and finally the 3rd Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes) is honestly a C-List hero for the past twenty years. He never really worked in the mainstream of the DC Universe.<br><br>The reactions for the first Shazam (Captain Marvel) movie made think this would work. I thought Shazam was going to fall flat... the second one actually did. Nobody remembers Captain Marvel even though he was an A-List hero (40's-50s), that outsold Supes and Batman for over a decade.<br><br>Despite DC pushing this 3rd Blue Beetle HARD since introducing him, he just hasn't garnered much of a following. Reyes' verision has been ""kid friendly"" hero since being introduced (like Captain Marvel/Shazam), and I honestly thought it was going to be REALLY good! A goofy ""Scooby-Doo"" kid friendly Super-hero romp, with a young Latino as the alter-ego! It's gonna be a hit!<br><br>I WAS WRONG! I found myself checking the time over and over again... I was just bored! The CGI was kept to a min imum compared to other movies and what was there wasn't that great. The movie did nothing for me at all. Again, Reyes in the comics has never been one of my favorites, but I really thought it could work on the big screen. I wish it had.",7
" Totally predictable bland entertainment
","Will see what Dunn can do to revive DC but their movies are so predictable.<br><br>Cliche characters, with typical ""invincible"" characters who have a single flaw/weakness, who don't behave like real people, and cheesy stories with poor acting. A family who doesn't do much with their lives who become ""sidekicks"" including a vulgar ghetto sister who swears as much as she must eat.<br><br>Very unsympathetic hero who is a failure in life, with a family that blames everyone else but themselves, finds a magical alien device that ""chooses"" him thereby transforming him into a superhero that doesn't want to harm people. A diabolical rich corporate elite who wants to create powerful military tech and wants the alien tech to ""power"" it. Hence the mind bending clever evolution of the story...resulting in a box office bomb.<br><br>Wow who would have thought this would happen to DC again. I guess they will release another reboot of Superman and Batman sometime to try and steal more money from people....oh wait.",1
" silly to the point of stupidity
","Modern movies should consider existing culture, especially when making movies about modern world. Current one does not consider any sort of reality related character conditions. All of them are flat, stupid, not able to predict any immediate implications, purely reactive and totally oblivious of consequences of their actions (even if one substracts sci-fi part of the situation). What is particularly disapointing is the fact that even characters like kord daughter who supposedly should know about corporation and its inner workings acts like a 5th grader not able to plan even 1.5 steps ahead. Main character in fact demonstrates complete lack of any logical analysis whatsoever. Movie about little kids in grownups bodies, who are just mainly lucky because villain is not much smarter. I find especially hillarious main hero constantly pleading to villains ""get me out of here"" or ""let me go""",2
" Blue Beetle's Family Rocks My Socks
","Streamers, it's time to hit the theaters again. Yes, that's what we did this week to see the DCEU's Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle follows an alien scarab that chooses a recent college grad, Jaime Reyes, to be its symbiotic host. This relationship bestowed the young man with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes a superhero. Let's see how the DCEU's first Latinx superhero comes across the big screen.<br><br>Honestly, we all know the DCEU has its issues in the live action movie realm. We know the leader at the helm has changed, but Blue Beetle is the last film from the previous regime. This film was set to be a streaming movie on Max but for whatever reason it was given the courtesy of debuting on the big screen. Just like Blue Beetle is currently missing from Max, there is something missing from this movie being great. The great part of this movie is Jaime Reyes' family unit led by George Lopez as his uncle, Rudy. Lopez and crew are full of energy, funny, familiar and bring life to the movie.<br><br>What lacks from this movie is a discernable character that fits a superhero. Xolo Mariduena, as Jaime, does a nice job toeing the line of culture, nerdy, cool but something just was missing. Maybe it was the predictable and foreshadowing storyline and writing or maybe it was just me. Either way, something just felt not engrossing about the story. What was a joy to watch was the action sequences. Unfortunately, a few of the better sequences were displayed in the trailer which contributed to the lackluster response I probably had in viewing. Speaking of lackluster, the bad guys in this movie were kind of boring. It's hard to have an invested villain in a movie with a character that is pretty unknown himself to the masses but here we are. The major question is where this movie will fit into the James Gunn version of the DCEU. I hope he continues this franchise going forward.<br><br>Trip: To me, Blue Beetle felt like a pilot to a HBO Max/Max television show. It did not feel grand enough to warrant the big screen treatment. Everything felt so basic. I appreciate the diversity of the depiction of a Mexican-American family in one of these superhero movies, but I wish the film had been more interesting. Yes, the family was cute, especially Nana played by Adriana Barraza. She was spunky and fun. However, I didn't find the family as funny as the rest of the audience I saw this with, but I do agree that the family brought the movie to life. They are a necessary component of what makes this movie work, if it works. Other than that, while the villain, Victoria Kord, has such a basic agenda and no real ethos behind her plan, Susan Sarandon was really fun playing her. She really sank her teeth into the villainy.<br><br>I'll put it out there, if this had gone straight to streaming this would be a big box of fresh popcorn to enjoy at home. Since it hit the big screen, of course the action needs to be seen large but we couldn't help but feeling like something was missing from making this movie good. George Lopez and family steal the show from the superhero and that's not a great sign for a superhero movie. Needless to say, go check out Blue Beetle with a bowl of popcorn during the matinee time but definitely when it hits Max (formerly HBO Max).",7

Who knew....<br><br>Based on the comic book of the same name, Blue Beetle tells the story of Jaime Reyes, he's just graduated from Gotham university, he comes back to his family home in (Palmera city, which I think is a fictional city in the same way that Gotham and metropolis is, but Palmera looks more like a city in florida... Like if metropolis is new York, Palmera is like a Miami)<br><br>He comes home to the news that his family is in financial trouble, he gets a job with his sister cleaning rich people's houses, here he bumps into Susan's Sarandons corporate bad villain Victoria Kord, along with her neice Jenny played by Bruna Marquezine. Victoria and Jenny and at odds over the direction of the family company, and krone specifically, about the application and use of a magical, out of this world, super power giving blue scarab thingy...<br><br>Jenny steals it, gives it to Jaime to hide... And... Off we go with the plot.<br><br>Thats all covered in the first 60 seconds of the trailer, so if you're ruining late for this movie... Fear not... As long as you've seen the trailer, you've seen the first 20 mins of this movie.<br><br>Blue Beetle is one of those characters that I'd never really heard of.... Other than I think one or two appearances on Smallville, and I think the character is in one of the injustice games.<br><br>It's not like it's one of DCs flagship properties....<br><br>So when it was announced they were making a blue Beetle movie.... I and many others were like.... Really...?..... Why...?<br><br>Buuuuuuut.... The exact same thing was said about guardians of the galaxy... And look how that turned out.<br><br>And blue Beetle does the same.... To a lesser extent I'd say. I'm not saying blue Beetle is on a par with guardians of the galaxy.... It's not....<br><br>But it is an enjoyable movie.<br><br>It's hard not to draw comparisons to other comic book movies... And this movie had a healthy dose of ant man, spiderman and iron man.<br><br>Especially iron man.. Character beats and structure wise.... Theres a lot of iron man in here... But... If you're gonna borrow.... Borrow from the best,<br><br>Cast
Everyone does a good job with what they're given....<br><br>Xolo Mariduenua carrys the film quite comfortably, and he gets to show case a bit more range than I think he's been afforded on kobra kai...
Comfortably and believably switching gears from likeable and humourous to emotional and thoughtful.<br><br>The familiar faces rounding out his family are equally likeable, good, and most importantly, believable. You definitely buy into the closeness of the family and of the culture.<br><br>Susan Sarandon isn't exactly breaking new ground as a by the numbers corporate villain.... But... She's. Susan Sarandon, it's not like she's bad in this.. She's just playing a stereotypical bad guy.<br><br>Oh... And it's great to see What we Do in the shadows actor Harvey Guillen also.... He's got a very small role in this, but great to see.<br><br>(if you haven't seen the what we do in the shadows tv show... Definitely check it out, it's BRILLIANT)<br><br>Something that took me by surprise was the social commentary aspect of the film....<br><br>Sublte comments on racism, classism, corporate patriarchal traditions, gentrification of poorer areas, plight of immigrant life... ....yeah. All of that is very subtly peppered thought the movie... All of it will go right over the kids heads.... But that's OK cos they'll be busy enjoying what is a fairly enjoyable movie<br><br>Speaking of kids, I saw this with my 6 year old and my 9 year old.... And both very much enjoyed it (I'll give their scores at the end)<br><br>And speaking of being subtle.... If you like this content be sure so hit the like button... And if you wanna see more....you know what to do....<br><br>Both the soundtrack and score is pretty on point also...<br><br>There's a couple of needles drops (motley crue and Cyprus hill being 2 standout, grin inducing moments)<br><br>The cgi is for the most part pretty good, there's no 'omg look at how bag the cgi is' moments...<br><br>So, while this is a good, fun, not overly long movie (about 2 hours...).... Much like the flash.... It feels like too little too late in the dcu or dceu...<br><br>Like... Is that part of the old dcu continuity? The 'Snyders verse'? Is it part of James Gunns new continuity?<br><br>Blue Beetle, like the flash, shazam, and aquaman 2 is one the movies that was and is kinda caught in limbo... With the regime changes at Warner bros dc....<br><br>I know James gunn has talked about it being part of his dc... It least the character... But yeah...the whole dc continuity thing just seems a bit of a mess....<br><br>Which is a shame.... Cos the Jaime Reyes character would have been very fun to have alongside the bigger guns in a justice league movie... Bringing aix of spiderman / antman vibes, kinda like civil war...<br><br>I could that dynamic working well... But alas.... Who knows what's gonna happen justice league / team up movie wise.<br><br>Like if I knew Jaime Reyes / blue Beetle was gonna be in a team up movie next year or the year after... I'd be hyped for that.... Time will tell....<br><br>So gonna go with 7/10 for this one....<br><br>The 6 year old gave it 7/10 also and the 9 year old gave it 9/10!<br><br>Its an enjoyable, if by the numbers, superhero origin story.... With a likeable lead and a likeable, believable surrounding cast, pdecent enough cgi.... And hints of where potential sequels might go.<br><br>(btw there is scenes during AND after the credits...

" Better than I thought.
","I always said don't let the critics decide what movie you want to watch.<br><br>My local newspaper gave ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" two starts. It turned out to be a wonderful romance and while I watched I predicted Louis Gossett Jr. Would win the ""Best Supporting Actor Oscar"" for his performance as Sargent Foley. 'Nuff Said.<br><br>Growing up in South Florida I saw first hand how important family was in the Latin Family structure. This was one thing I liked about the movie. What I didn't care for was the wokeness. What drew me to the movie was Xolo Mariduena as Jaime Reyes. I am a big fan of his work on Cobra Kai and he doesn't miss a beat. Graduating from college he comes home ready to take on the world only to be disappointed landing a job at a hotel where he gets fired. Here he meets Jenny Kord played by Bruna Marquezine the ""Black Sheep"" of the Kord family neice of Victoria Kord played by Susan Sarandon. The actor who blew me away was Adriana Berraza's character ""Nana"" who goes from a typical grandma to ""Rambolina"". There were some hiccups but the movie is worth seeing. I believes it does deserve the sequel that the hint after the credit shows.",7
" Much better than I expected
","This movie is a great example of how to make a comic book movie. I loved it from start to finish. Initially, when this movie was announced and the trailer was shown, I was skeptical and I didn't think it would be very good. But after seeing it, I am shocked to see that I was wrong, and I couldn't be happier. Immediately the movie has this great sense of style, it feels like the 90s, when comic book movies were wilder and more fun, it's a completely stand alone experience so you don't need DCEU knowledge to see this. The characters are great, Jaime Reyes is a great main character, but his family shines with him to create an incredible ensemble cast that gives the movie a great and unique feel and personality to it. The costume designs and special effects really made the movie for me too, it has this power rangers feel. The costumes are by no means bad, but they have this quality to them that adds significantly to the unique style the film has. The main villain has an amazing design, and while I would've love for him to have an extensive set of scenes to flesh him out more, I feel like they utilize the time he has in the movie to a beautiful effect. If I had to pick a standout actor in the film, I'll definitely have to go with George Lopez, he really brings a lot of heart and humor to his character, and his development is very well done and heartfelt. The soundtrack was great too, a standout to me and one of the main reasons the movie has such a distinct 90s flavor to it, and the world we're shown throughout the movie is so unique and true to its comic book roots. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie, every character is excellent and it never drags. It tells a great story dealing with family and finding purpose, it's a hopeful tale that feels extra special to me, as I am about the same age as our dear protagonist. I hope by some stroke of luck, Blue Beetle gets to shine on and get another movie, so we can see more of his development and the great performance Xolo brings as the character. I'm so happy this movie was way better than I thought it would be.",10
" A DC film that doesn't suck for once
","This film was a bit of a surprise as I actually quite liked it.<br><br>2023 has been a year of disappointment from both DC and Marvel with only Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and parts of The Flash redeeming either of the respective studios. Perhaps superhero fatigue is setting in or perhaps the studios are running out of ideas but with the bar set so low this film is actually quite entertaining.<br><br>Coming across as a more comedic mash-up of Iron Man and Venom, it certainly isn't flawless as it is guilty of some shonky digital effects in a few places and is a little bit predictable too but it has a big heart, an unknown but charismatic lead, an engaging turn from. Susan Sarandon as the villain and a nice family orientated plot.<br><br>The film is nicely plotted and doesn't feel overly long either, which makes a nice change in a film of this type. It very loosely connects with the DCEU, making a fleeting reference to Superman and Gotham City. There is no brooding of the main character and the plot doesn't feel particularly flabby. There is a touch absurdity but it's generally for comic effect and most of the gags work. Seeing as the DCEU era is coming to an end, this is actually a decent effort to go out on. It may not be a classic of its kind but it hasn't been massively hyped either, making it a pleasant and fun surprise.",7
" Kept me wondering things and engaged
","I liked things about this movie. I read the other reviews complaining about this movie. Popular complaints are that it's a typical super hero movie. It's been played out over and over again. The mixed feelings about the family dynamic and humor, fake or forced. A super hero that's not a hero willingly and he's not active but saved a lot. The villains are lame.<br><br>All these criticisms are mostly true but I was still very interested and entertained. I liked the general vibe, the music, atmosphere, the humor, the main characters, visuals, the plot... though simple, felt intimate and very understandable.<br><br>I think what drew me into this movie in the very beginning is wondering what the main characters are going to do to get out of poverty. Then, what got me interested next what is the scarab or beetle going to do to this kid or young adult, is he going to be hurt? Then I was interested in what are the capabilities of this scarab beetle, and what can it do? It has very unique capabilities. I was interested in finding out more about this beetle alien to know it's history. Then what made me interested next was how is Jaime, I think that's the main character's name, going to escape the bad guys and get away. There was always something else to wonder about.

","Average movie, feels like a film done a 100 times already. If you think of Iron Man and Ant man, but no where near as good or enjoyable. It actually reminds me of the lower budget films during from the 90's, such as Guyver 1991 or Star Kid, where a boy finds an alien super suit.<br><br>The action really wasn't great I have to say, it was actually quite boring in my opinion. There was no real character development either. Would have like to have seen more about the backstory of the scarab and the previous Blue beetle and less of the family. None of the characters really held any weight or had any substance.<br><br>Basically there was nothing of the film to shout about it was just bang average. A film you can watch once and be done with. Anyone that scores this movie over 6 IMO is pushing an agenda. Rating should be based on the film alone and the film was very much average. THE END<br><br>That being said, If you have some free time to kill or want to chill out and don't have much else to watch then the movie is worth a watch, but don't be expecting anything new or exciting.",5
" Very Marvel Like
","Aside from already having one strike against it with a horrible human being like George Lopez in the movie (And was as mediocre as normal), the movie was as boring as many Marvel movies normally are.<br><br>DC movies when they're bad, they are pretty bad, but unlike Marvel movies, are not extremely boring. Normally being compared to a Marvel movie is a good thing with how good they can be when they are not overrated or have a bad script, but this one has the possible overrated or boring aspects of a bad Marvel movie.<br><br>To me DC movies when they good can be better then a Marvel movie, but when bad, again, they can be worse. This is DC movie because though not good, it's bad because of how boring it is.<br><br>A bad human being that really is not as talented as some think likevGeorge Lopez aside, and how it drags out, almost boring, there are some amazing shots, that helped it for me to st least give it a 5.",5
" finally blue beetle
","Recovering from car accident, i was happy to discover the Blue Beetle. Not only was he the first hispanic (I'm half and half), but what i thought was even cooler was that he was the first super hero from the southwest (El Paso). Being from northern NM and have visited Las cruces, NM, El Paso, TX, and Juarez, MX, I was happy to find a hero from my neighborhood, not some super hero swinging from, New York, Gotham or Metropolis. I loved looking at the artwork. Many NY artist have never been to the SW, and can't draw the Southwestern desert to save their lives, and to compensate, they draw tons of Saguaros, a cactus only located in the Sonoran desert of Arizona ansd Mexico not the Chihuahuan desert of Texas and New Mexico.<br><br>I know that it is difficult to bring the written/drawn comic world to screen, but given that there is a huge film presence in NM, a lot of scifi (roswell) and scientific (Los Alamos) communities to draw from, it wouldn't be difficult to film Blue Beetle in his native environs vs a made up city in Florida....and the reason for the 9 stars.<br><br>Regardless of location. I laughed my head off, as I said half my family is latino and the Jaime's Nana is combination of my grandma and tia. About 30% of the expression were unknown to me as my background is Panamanian not Mexican, but what i did understand both verbally and body language made me laugh. There was a handful of us in The Wednesday afternoon matinee and I was laugh most of the time.<br><br>If you want to find out more of Blue Beetle, check out the animation series, Batman, the Brave and the Bold. There are several episodes that team the Blue Beetle with his mentor, Batman. They are hilarious.",9

The movie was flat, the cgi were not as worst as the flash but it still hurt my eyes.

","I'll be outright and say was going give it a 5 or 6 but 1) nobody said ""I love the Powerglove, it's so bad"" and 2) there was smooching so it had to have points docked.<br><br>Is a pretty good picture though. Feels a lot like the recent Saint Seiya picture with the suits and the helichopter and the climax and the chick side character parental figure lady villain. Not saying this aped the Saint Seiya picture cause they was prolly in development same time but its a trend. Not too bad a trend, suits look cool and we love a lady villain.<br><br>Superheroes who whine all ""noooooo, I can't kill people"" are booooring and need to stop, we hate it. But we love to see acknowledging the original Blue Beetle even though this is a modern Blue Beetle picture. Blue Beetle and Booster Gold picture soon maybe?",3
" Terrible script and graphics
","I regret the lost 1:11 hours (I couldn't watch it till the end).<br><br>I don't know why they filmed something like that. However, such a film was predictable after Black Adam. It should probably be called the Latino beetle :S
Also the terrible graphics in 1978's Superman are better than the graphics in this movie. It clearly lags behind the works of graphic artists of other studios.<br><br>In general, you can't blame dc for using bad graphics in other comics, but here they obviously used newbies or fixed it on fiverr. :)

I was very entertained from the time he gains his powers, shows them off and gets into a few fights. The special effects were on point, too. I hardly noticed them.<br><br>The latino humour fell flat in places. However, the theme of family hit home for me and was very well done about halfway through when my heartstrings were well and truly pulled.<br><br>I highly recommend this film for a fun time out for late teens upward.

" Don't do it to yourself
",Okay! So this was not a great movie ! Not a good one at all !! The script was dreadful. Back story wasn't good and quite difficult to keep track off. It all felt very random and rushed . One of them movies you would absolutely not watch twice ! It's very very disappointing ! Really Is a shame because there idea is a great idea and they could have done so much with it. Acting was okay good few actors in there but again could have been better. There really is not much more to say about it if you haven't seen it save yourself 2 hours and watch separate house wife's instead a lot more entertaining.,2
" Please stop giving George Lopez work!!! lol
","The Blue Beetle was the only decent character in this film and the suit was awesome. The rest of the family has a made for TV vibe. I couldn't have cared less if they all were wiped out. It seems like the creators were looking to get a lot of laughs but It all fell flat. It makes me wonder how much influence Lopez had with the comedic side of the movie because that joke stealing hack never was and never will be funny and this movie never was and never will be funny. The family vibe felt forced. The most adrenaline filled song in the film was used for a slow crawling scene. The other song choices were terrible. The villain never seemed to pose any real threat besides being something Blue Beetle had to fight. Whoever put this together just slapped parts of other superhero movies together and it shows. Not creative in any way. I'd say it's better than Shazam 2 but that's a low bar to overcome. I don't see myself ever wanting to watch this again. Stop giving George Lopez work. This is a bad movie, thus the 5/10 The hero was cool and it's the only thing saving it from an even lower rating. This was brutal to watch.",5
" Loved his mechanical BeetleSock gadget. Great film!

All he had to do was imagine it and the sock opened up and shot a blue lazer beam in the general direction of his arch enemies.<br><br>I particularly enjoyed the scene where his arch-enemy stole the BeetleSock and strapped it to his leg. He arranges a meeting with the other underworld bosses in an effort to impress them with the power of the BeetleSock.<br><br>Unfortunately, the sock was rigged to be only worn by Blue Beetle himself and it began squirting milk around the room instead of a lazer beam.

" Great cast but mediocre story coupled with CGI overload.
","If Blue Beetle had been released in 2019, it would've released to far more praise but sadly, Blue Beetle simply regurgitates the same story and visual effects overload which has become a staple to the superhero genre.<br><br>The only saving grace of this movie is the cast and what they bring to the table. However there are a few moments which clearly show that the writers had no idea what to do with some of the cast members, and would've been far better if they had simply discarded those scenes or changed the scenes to omit these characters from those scenes instead of forcing them to be part of the script.<br><br>Furthermore, it feels like the script kept jumping between comedy, action and drama. It would've been far better had the script focused on comedy since this the strong suit of majority of the cast.",6
" Why such disappointment from people?
","This film is great. Don't follow what the nay sayers say. Make up your own mind.<br><br>For me, even though I have zero Spanish, it was a really enjoyable superhero film at the high quality I expect out of DC.<br><br>I didn't know any of the storyline for Blue Beetle prior to this film so maybe I missed something there.<br><br>The comments about casting are mostly bull.. Sadly the one point that I found disappointing was Ms Sarandon didn't quite fit the role. Otherwise, the family as part of the story line is brilliant. And I have to say why not have more of that. It makes the film more relateable for younger crowds and there are some great moments to the family scenes.<br><br>Some of the fight scenes were a little OTT but really it's a superhero action movie.. I want that OTT because it's fun..I don't need to see blood and gore in slow mo..<br><br>I would have scored this film higher but for a few little slips in the continuity and story line.. 8 is the second highest I score a film..<br><br>like I said at the start - watch this film and make up your own mind.

It is a great family film and the cast and collaborative piece of entertainment art they produced with this is out of this world and then some.<br><br>I think that the dialogue and some of the scenes with the abuela and the Tio Rudy were probably the best and really moved the movie forward to give you both jam-packed, edge-of-your-seat thrills while throwing in some really epic heartwrenching and wholesome loving moments as well. I was more than pleasantly surprised.<br><br>I was totally captivated and loved every single detail about this movie from the DC universe. I really loved the way this family worked together and how each of the characters was a solid and comical character on their own - not just a supporting role but an extension of the very core of the most powerful emotion in the universe, LOVE.<br><br>I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action superhero films that stick to your heart and leave you laughing, cheering, and smiling the whole entire way!",10

If you want something good for yourself, you listen to the actors and spend time with your family instead of the movie. Bad actors, boring story, terrible direction. Annoying side characters and unfortunately ends with a cliffhanger. Just hope that there won't be a sequel, because I understand that other cultures should be presented, but instead of diversity, a good story should have been better. However, this movie leads in one thing: we have never seen such an imperfect protagonist in any Marvel movie. He whines and suffers, completely unmanly.<br><br>The family is absolutely dysfunctional, the bearded bastard is horrible and I kept rooting for him to die during one of the battles. Unfortunately, he didn't die and continued to be unlucky. I, on the other hand, almost died of boredom.",2
" Definitely could've been better.
","Blue Beetle was something I had been awaiting to see. Not because I know much about the hero itself, but mainly because I was looking forward to something different other than The Flash or something that we've already known about for so long. Blue Beetle I knew from the Injustice video games as a playable character. The trailer itself had looked pretty cool to me and I honestly had some hopes about it. However, ehhh, it wasn't all what I had really expected it to be.<br><br>The cast of this movie is fine. The effects are cool as well. That's really why I am giving it a 5/10. That's not my problem. I had a problem with how long the film was. How much it seemed to drag for me, as there wasn't really much of an engaging story to keep me focused throughout the movie. Plus, it got super annoying watching Blue Beetle the whole movie, being completely clueless on how to use his powers and running away like a scaredy-cat all the time. I would've at least thought that after the beginning, we see Blue Beetle adapt fully within himself and then become this ruthless, badass hero that we would've love to have seen. I mean, was this the actual intention the writers wanted with this character? To be lost throughout the whole 2 hours?<br><br>Kinda glad I watched this movie in the comfort of my own home when I was in boredom. I couldn't have imagined seeing this on the big screen. If I did, it would've made me even more disappointed. Other than that, Blue Beetle is something I would most likely not be watching again. And the post credits weren't all that exciting to me either. So I can say for myself that I don't have anything to be looking forward to.",5
" 5 for special effects
","I just can't give DC anymore chances! This movie COULD HAVE BEEN amazing! However, it was so much unnecessary humor and punchlines. My husband also point pointed out to me some of the dialogue was racist. It was reminiscent of the the first Iron Man in that the beetle was the perfect suit but a big corporation wanted a military style killing machine. The beetle, Jaime (Hi-me) was a recent pre-law graduate who was chosen by the scarab (beetle). He apparently was book smart but had NO COMMON SENSE. The beetle's one function was the protect Jaime and neutralize any threat to him. However, Jaime wouldn't kill anyone. When he was being beaten nearly to death, his logic was to talk it out - literally. When his family was being shot at, he wanted to stun the enemy, who kept getting up, and eventually caused his father to have a fatal heart attack. His family killed everyone who got between them and rescuing him. Some of the ""questionable"" dialogue and scenes were....<br><br>1) When the bad guys came to his family's home, they were Hispanic, the bad guys, (the ones with the guns) told the head bad guy, a rich white woman, they found his family. She said ""You know what to do! Round them up!"".<br><br>2) Jaime went to the corporation, (bad guys) and told the white receptionist his name, ""Hello my name is Jaime ( I can't remember his last name) and she said Jaime (Ja-mee). It seemed they did that to all the Hispanics in the movie.<br><br>3) The grandmother, who only spoke Spanish, turned out to be a former guerrilla rebel!<br><br>It just had me rooting for the bad guys. The only thing that made this movie tolerable was the special effects! Outstanding!<br><br>Other than that, save your money and wait for it to come on Max!",5

Having a movie converted into multiple languages is one of the guarantees of its success.<br><br>Movies tell stories that people all over the globe can be interested in or relate to.

I don't know if it's just me but this ""we/I don't kill"" needs to stop in the superhero realm, because things are just going to come back over and over again as did one of the villains in Blue Beetle.<br><br>The Spanish subtitles were a good touch but adding curses in Spanish within the audio and not the subtitles was a dumb idea. Just don't add in the curses if you're trying to make it PG-13. I know the script writer tried to make it enjoyable for adults and children but something went wrong somewhere because the jokes were weird and the children didn't understand in the theater.<br><br>The main building were most of the movie took place was clearly an attempt of CGI... it was horrific to look at.<br><br>And that brings me to my last point, the fight scenes. ALL OF THEM and i mean ALL were waayyy to close to how anime fight scenes are. The sound effects, the way they recovered when knocked down, and the speech during it... it was appalling and I don't think we should be bringing ideas from different genres of film over just because your ideas are lacking originality and you want views.",4
" Little better than the Flash(movie)

The camera movement and generally the fighting skills shown were really commendable. They actually engross you in the scene. On top of that background music was really great.<br><br>Kind of fit with the whole and many scenes for kind of almost perfect. You could actually feel the feelings of different people and what they were going through.<br><br>This thing is what I found different in this movie that this had a holistic approach i.e it wasn't more focused only the superhero and his fighting.<br><br>Animations may seem a little off on buildings constructed by CGI but overall a negligible factor.<br><br>Flash had all these things accept a good background score, I suppose.

This was a waste of my time.<br><br>Kid gets superpower and he goes ""Oh no, how do I get rid of this inconvenience, all I wanted was to get a job and work for the rest of my life so I could pay off my debts""
Then after all of that comes the ""Oh no, I'm not a killer"" So now we have to watch a fight between this loser hero beating the same guy 50 times just for the sake of ""action"" because ""action"" is supposedly sells...<br><br>You see, when your family is at risk, there is absolutely nothing you wouldn't do to protect them, but these bs scripts ...

Representation matters!<br><br>I knew this was giving me Black Panther vibes, and I cried just as much too. The films only quirk is you see elements from other heroes timelines. A little bit of Iron Man, Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Black Panther. A lot of deja vu, but still a great film. The Spanish representation is really present with icons inserted throughout the film: Don Francisco, El Chapulín Colorado, Cheech &amp; Chong, Thalia, Selena, a soundtrack of popular latin singers and a classic telenovela that made both audiences laugh.<br><br>It's nice to see the DC Easter Eggs throughout the film as well. A little bit of Batman, Flash, and Superman sprinkled in for fun. Blue Beetle is a great start to the continued new DCverse that Gunn is about to reboot.<br><br>So Blue Beetle gets a 9 out of 10! That emotional climax really got me. I cried both times!

The problem is it was missing the originality essence it felt like more of venom with Spiderman (stark's) outlook unlike superman Batman and other heros this was missing originality it would have been better if you have touched origins a bit movie is just 127min could have added another 10min and show some of its origin would have made it much better may in next part if made try it's origins and another problem is it's more on childish side I am clearly confused may be in future if you Collab blue bettle with justice league how it would look already have one child in form of Shazam now another one. If next part is made try to improve the maturity of the character too...,8
" Infuriatingly Dumb
",The hero is annoying and stupid with no redeeming qualities aside from being cute. No character development... not someone you would want to root for. He's stupid.. not fun stupid..just stupid. When his friends are being shot..he ran towards them instead of stopping the villain right in front of him. Just stupid!<br><br>I didn't have high expectations going in... just to have fun at least. Writing is so bad you dont know how it got approved in the first place. I'm usually okay with mindless fun... but the writing will take you out of the fun. Actors tried their best but with the writing.. they can only do so much.,5
" Great film!
","Great movie, did not understand the hate this film got. I decided to give a try despite reading the negative reviews and was really surprised at how good the film is! It has a real nostalgic vibe whilst also being comical at the same time.<br><br>It's refreshing and something very different in the franchise of DC. I just hope they make a sequel as it deserves it.<br><br>The down to earth character are what make this film so lovable and the aesthetics too of the neon, plus the soundtrack is great, real nostalgic vibe. Brought back memories of the 80s and general good vibes.<br><br>Give it a go, you won't be disappointed !",8
" Made for children
","This film was written and aimed at children and their families. Don't expect violence, eroticism, progressive speeches or red flags, in other words it falls into the same category as Shazam and Black Adam, with the exception that in the case of Shazam 2 the concern of to empower the female characters was implicit, in this film on the other hand there is a balance of genders, appreciation of family and latino culture and that typical DCU childish sense of humor that matches the b-side character like Blue Beetle. So don't expect a film full of surprises, twists and a script intertwined with the League's confusing universe, but just entertainment, school theater performances, silly jokes and not so special effects, typical of recent years where most of the fight scenes are always conveniently done in the shadows or at night. And that's it.",5
" Classic superhero film that keeps engaged
","Blue Beetle is a fresh film for DC which will surely get positive reviews.<br><br>I liked the film's story and also the way family bonding was shown. There are funny scenes, emotional scenes, action scenes as well as romantic scenes.

" So/So
","I thought it was a decent movie, but it had some flaws. The acting was good, especially from Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes. The film also did a good job of representing Latino culture. However, the plot was a bit predictable and the action sequences were not that exciting. Overall, I would recommend Blue Beetle to fans of superhero movies, but I wouldn't say it's a must-see.<br><br>Here are some of the things I liked about the film:<br><br>Xolo Maridueña was great as Jaime Reyes.

I was still confused about what he could do by the end of the movie.<br><br>Overall, I thought Blue Beetle was a decent movie. It had some good things going for it, but it also had some flaws.

" Brilliant
","I loved it! This film reminded me why I love superhero films, it had cool fights and powers, good characters, and most importantly a lot of heart behind it.<br><br>The main character was likeable and relatable, I like that this film is about a struggling Mexican family, and brought a different perspective to most other superhero films I've seen. One big thing I liked about the film is the focus on family, and how they love and look after each other. I really liked Jaime's sister, she was funny (even if she was slightly annoying a couple of times), I thought she'd be my favourite family member, but actually Jaime's grandma was my favourite (I won't say why, but if you watch it you'll know what I mean!). I thought Jenny was a very good character, well-defined personality, good heart, and very skilled - not ""just"" a love interest for the main character.<br><br>The villain was also very good, in that you love to hate her and hope she gets her comeuppance. And at least one person working for the villain also gets character development which was really nice to see.<br><br>The film had good emotional moments, I cried at one point and there were other times that moved me. The blue beetle suit was great and we also get to see some other gadgets and things which I thought were really cool.<br><br>I didn't know anything about Blue Beetle before watching the trailer for this film, but I saw it with someone who knew more about Blue Beetle and he thought they adapted it well.<br><br>As I said before, I love the heart behind the film and the different perspectives that it offered, as well as the classic elements it has that contribute to a good superhero film. I really liked it and can't wait to see more of Blue Beetle in the future!",9
" Typical but still fun superhero film
","Blue Beetle tells the story of Jaime Reyes (Mariduena) as he finds himself at a crossroads in his life. He is the first person in his family to graduate from university but comes home to find his family struggling financially largely due to the hands of Kord Industries led by the power hungry leader Victoria Kord (Sarandon). Jaime is desperate to do anything to support his family, so when he comes across Kord's niece Jenny (Marquezine) who asks him to protect a stolen piece of alien technology, he accepts. But the technology unwittingly chooses him and infuses him with godlike powers. He must now learn how to control the persona of the Blue Beetle, a figure who can create any weaponry with his mind.<br><br>The first two thirds of the movie are a generic fun blockbuster led by a man born to play the role of Jaime Reyes. Xolo Mariduena is a delight as the main character and plays the unwilling hero trope to perfection. He is a good kid that can still become emotional as anyone would be if they were thrusted into receiving godlike powers. However, it does mean that for the first two acts of the movie he is basically untouchable. This does detract from some of the tension the movie tries to build. However, the third act does offer some twists.<br><br>As Jaime is put into this terrible situation, the people he loves most, his Nana (Barraza), Mother (Carrillo), sister (Escobedo), father (Alcazar) and uncle (Lopez) are all put in peril and have to come to terms with the fact that Jaime cannot be anyone other than Blue Beetle. The family dynamic is what really makes this movie truly special, they didn't ask to have their house foreclosed nor did they ask to have their son/grandson/brother/nephew infected with alien technology, but they came together and each one of them got an emotionally acted moment to shine in the movie. Every single family member got to get involved in the action, and because of that angle, it truly embodied the Mexican/Latina spirit so incredibly well.<br><br>The third act of the movie makes it worth watching, but it does not necessarily forgive the movie from being formulaic in the first two acts. From the secondary villain (Trujillo) being the same as the hero but evil, to the main villain being just a power hungry military industrial manufacturer only after money, to love interest character also being an exposition machine; it even has a henchmen with a change of heart. This movie is full of these plot points that can be formulaic/weightless at best to dragging at worst, and it is exemplified by the fact that for most of the movie, the audience cannot see Blue Beetle or Karapax's face in the suits, they are just two faceless creatures punching and shooting electric pulses at each other. And it really is a shame because they could have just played up the biggest selling point of the movie: family and how even though they are not superpowered, they are the strong shell that protects their respective selves. There is one twist I did like involving the secondary antagonist's backstory which I thought should have gotten more screentime, and does tie into the themes well. This plot point is effective because it not only breaks the suits and reveals their faces of the characters but also their imperfections, and gives the actors a chance to deliver heart wrenching performances. However, like the suits, this movie brings up some heavy topics in the first act like gentrification of Hispanic neighbourhoods and imperialism and its effects on Central and South America and hides them from the audience for the vast majority of the movie.<br><br>This movie could have been greater then the sum of its parts, but in the end I am just relieved that it was as good as it was, given the circumstances surrounding it's tie-ins to the larger picture. The DC Extended Universe is coming to an end, and taking its place is the DC Universe, and I do not know if this movie will be successful enough to continue on the family legacy. I do hope that Xolo Mariduena continues to play Blue Beetle because he is a charismatic and humorous talent that can make an audience both laugh and cry, but above all else I hope that Nana (Barraza) joins the Justice League alongside Superman and Batman.",8
" Some won't like it because it's anti-Imperialist
","A very un-narcissistic super hero is not going to go down well with mainstream US pop culture audience. But it's going to do really well with everyone else.<br><br>An anti-Imperialist pro-Latin American super hero. A communist revolutionary for a grandmother. A illegal immigrant for a father. An anarchist sister breaking all the class norms. Lots of slapstick, lots of heart. A super hero for the people.<br><br>A lot of political messaging tucked into the story. Ronald Reagan bombing rural American villages, the CIA funding child soldiers, training mercenaries and political elites at the school of the Americas, islands acquired by multinationals acquired by the CIA from dictators ... The business of war.<br><br>And it's just a good old super hero movie.",9
" Painful to watch...
",The storyline was just predictable and boring.<br><br>The acting was... well.. fake.<br><br>Very formulaic but without a good formula.<br><br>I never connected emotionally with the main character. The storyline seemed just to be taking from different hero stories and adding in scenes that audiences would react to. We all need a hero. To see ourselves in our heroes. But this. Wow.<br><br>I hate to say it but DC writers need some fresh perspective. It seems the new DC heads made a movie geared to a demographic which in the US is the largest and has the greatest economic power. This guaranteed economic returns not based on the quality of the movies but demographic support.,1
" Stereotype and predictable.
","I watched that movie in cinema. The scene is amazing and shock. I love the mecha and the beetle car. The main characters have good look, I like the actress, so pretty. The fighting Scene is so good.<br><br>But the reason I give 6 is that it's too stereotype for 2023, the plot is so predictable. I even nearly fall asleep in the cinema.<br><br>The hero's father is a bright spot I think. It is kind like about the sense of destiny. I love that.<br><br>The grandma role is cute, but wouldn't you think it is a little bit embarrassing? And not funny, I think that, sorry.<br><br>I watched the movies with my bf, he loves the movie. He said it is a good Marvel movie though.",6
" It's ok if you are under 12
","First, I have to admit I can't stand Lopez. Why anyone would use him in a movie is beyond me. It's like he's the only Hispanic they know, which is sad because I live in Mexico and there are so many others to choose from who can actually act.<br><br>This was made for a very young audience not sure why they felt the need for Spanish curse words in a movie made for kids but hollywood seems to like destroying any moral boundaries that are left. Like most superhero films put out lately the script is nothing new, just different characters doing the same things we've seen them do over and over. It's like boy bands whose music is computer generated, it's fine for kids but boors me to tears.<br><br>There are much better movies for your kids, unless you enjoy spending $15 each to sit in a theater listening to other kids making noise because even they seemed bored at our viewing.<br><br>Skip this one until it comes on your streaming service...",3
" Family!
","I don't care what the critics say, this movie has got a lot of hearts. I love it, especially the first half. The theme of family is strong here. Jenny Kord said it best: Jaime's house is full of love. Everyone in this movie gave good performances, but the one who really caught my eye is the guy playing jaime's father, alberto. It's no coincidence the good things in the movie happen when he was around. George lopez also did a great job as rudy. I had such low expectations coming into the theater, but I sure left with a big smile in my face. I was never familiar with blue beetle character, and this movie did a great job introducing him. I hope he stays on in james gunn's DCEU. It's not a perfect movie, and I wouldnt even call it a good superhero movie. The villain is kinda weak, but at least this movie doesnt pretend to be bigger than it is. The second half of this movie is a bit stereotypical of superhero movie, which is getting old, but it shouldnt be how this movie is judged. It's a lot of fun.",8
" Surprisingly good super hero movie
","This movie is amazing! I went in thinking it was going to be a typical super hero movie with predictable plot and cheesy Characters. However, all my expectations for this movie were surpassed. You will be on a rollercoaster coaster ride through out the movie. The film does a good job of making the scenes not too long and not too boring.<br><br>There is Great story line and characters that surprise you. I loved the fact that there was a mixture of Spanish, Portuguese, and English throughout the film. So much of the movie is rooted in the Latin American Community and connection with family. Take everyone you know to go see it. I will definitely watch it again. Imax is recommended.",9
" Have all the Superhero Films already been written?
","Honestly the 5/10 is possibly a bit generous but Xolo Maridueña gave such a great performance that it certainly lifts the film. Apart from that, what more can be said? It's just another Superhero Film which to me, is heartbreaking to say because 5 years ago, I would be saying the more the merrier! Little did I know that writers would be going on strike because they were worried about AI stealing their jobs (I am aware it's not just that, pay is a massive factor too) but it feels like AI is already writing these films..... It is SO by the numbers. It could easily be just another Iron Man/Spider-Man/Ant-Man/Shazam! Etc. It just happens to be about Blue Beetle who is actually a fun and interesting character but is in a mostly boring movie.<br><br>The weirdest decision in this film is that Jaime is extremely against killing but I guess is perfectly fine with his family members doing it....? Jaime isn't aware of this moment at the time but Rudy kills someone and Mili yells ""20 points!"". It is so incredibly jarring consindering like 10 minutes ago Jaime was adamant about not killing.<br><br>Anyway you already know everything that is going to happen in this film within the first 5 minutes, even the credits scenes were predictable.",5
" Loved it
","On an emotional level.. i rank it up there with Endgame, the episode of Young Justice where Conner died, and the first Wonder Woman with Gal. I haven't felt so much in a short couple of hours in years... This heartfelt explanation of Blue Beetles origin made me grateful I decided to buy it now instead of waiting for it to maybe show up on Max. The acting is superb. The cinematography is on on point, then there's this scene that was so weep done it took me back to a moment I haven't to confrin my real life. I won't describe it. I sincerely thank everyone who participated in bringing this to life.",10
" A bit too childish, but entertaining enough to watch.
","Blue Beetle will still be a reasonable newcomer to the superhero world for the general public. That's not surprising either since Blue Beetle is a comic that only saw his first issue appear in February 2006. Now DC has been expanding the DC universe for quite some time, but that goes with peaks and troughs. Nowhere do the movies really want to tap the level of the first 4 phases of the Marvel movies. Still, there really seems to be progress in it, because after a few disappointments such as Wonder Woman 2 and the terrible Harley Quin- movie, where I don't even feel like mentioning the entire title, there seems to be an advance when we look at The Suicide Squad from 2021 and the recently released The Flash. Adding Blue Beetle could therefore be a good move, although DC is unfortunately not really known for its good CGI effects, which often seem to be very substandard despite the expensive productions. Sometimes it feels a bit like this is happening on purpose, but real logic can't be found behind that. Hopefully Blue Beetle will then become a bit of a tipping point and hopefully the DC movies will finally go in a direction that we want to see.<br><br>In terms of effects, the film is still fine. Here and there the CGI might have been a bit better, but taken by boat it's fine. So no bottlenecks there. Where the bottleneck actually lies a bit is the extremely childish and bland humor that the film contains. There is a bit of an attempt to put some kind of Ant-Man-like humor into the film, but this happens in a way that you normally see appear in The Power Rangers or such a youth production. Here and there, the names of Superman and Batman are used to cultivate recognition, naming Batman as a wealthy fascist. It will all have to do with the all-Mexican cast and the fact that DC wants to come across as politically correct. By the way, this is something we see more often, there was the last Transformers movie recently and a few years ago of course Terminator: Dark Fate who also made a very large part of the cast Mexican. What is very disturbing in Blue Beetle in that is that there is a lot of English spoken to which the opposing party responds in Spanish. Still a bit disturbing and annoying, especially considering the burned-in large English subtitles marred the image.<br><br>Fortunately, there are also positive things to report, because actually just like in The Flash, you won't be bored for seconds. The film lasts just over 2 hours and takes about 20 minutes to explain the story a bit and let you bond with the main characters and then the action starts and you are immediately plunged into a lot of fights, shooting, walking, screaming, jumping and so on. The film was actually made to get directly to MAX (formerly HBO Max), but they still opted for a cinema release and this is quite understandable when you watch the film. These types of action movies often come into their own best on the big screen and probably this would have been more disappointing on a smaller home screen than it does now. Not everyone acts equally well, of course you get a lot of drama about halfway through that stretches the film a bit unnecessarily, but luckily the makers didn't pull it towards the 3 o'clock, something that the Marvel- films in particular were good at.<br><br>Blue Beetle has become a nice movie, where you won't be bored.

" What an amazing surprise. Loved it
","Blue Beetle is the latest offering from DC and trust me when i said, it's the best one I've seen since the suicide squad in 2021. Before going into the theatre, I had low expectations, but boy I was just blown away by the film<br><br>Let's start with the Pros:<br><br>1. The film takes a step back from the city of Gotham and brings us to Palmera City to meet the Mexican family of Jaime Reyes consisting of his father, mother, grandmother, sister and uncle<br><br>2. The film's visual effects are much much better than the Flash, Black Adam and Shazam 2.<br><br>3.

" Good start for the DCU!
","Great start for the new DC! This movie reminded me of a solid Marvel Phase 1 movie. It really felt like a mix of Ironman 1 and Antman. This movie was a blast, embracing Hispanic culture and style throughout. For those who grew up in Hispanic households, it's likely to trigger many core memories.<br><br>The standout aspect for me was the emphasis on family - refreshingly, they're all in the loop about what's happening, avoiding the usual secret identity trope. The trailers showcase their united front, and George Lopez's unexpected role shines as my favorite character, much like Luis from the Ant-Man series - injecting wild fun into the mix.<br><br>The movie's soundtrack was another highlight. Balancing original tracks with a variety of Spanish hits, it added an extra layer of richness. The storytelling remains self-contained, peppered with DC Easter eggs. Director James Gunn's choice to kick off the new DC Universe with Blue Beetle seems to be a smart move, given the potential the movie sets up. It's evident that the world-building has begun, introducing significant players already.<br><br>Originally planned as an HBO Max stream, the film's promotion to theater release under the new DC regime was a wise decision. Blue Beetle makes for a strong start, both for the character and the new DC direction. The mid-credit scene promises exciting possibilities for future projects, and there's a clever audio surprise if you stay till the very end. I enjoyed it, and my girlfriend absolutely adored it. A solid opening for DC! Great Flick!",7
" Probably the worst hero movie I've seen so far
","This is probably the worst hero movie I've seen.<br><br>It's like looking at Fast and Furioso with Vin Petrol saying ""for Family"" over and over again. If you count the number of times ""family"" was said, you would probably wind up at around 120 times.<br><br>I do understand culture, and I do understand that this movie is targeting Latin American culture, but man... Actors are really bad, and their lines are so bad. The Protagonist doesn't even contribute to the plot or anything at all.<br><br>Also, we don't really get an origin story for the Beetle, which is kinda' strange, considering this is a new character on the big screen for folks like me that don't read or have access to comic books.<br><br>Total let down.

" The Penultimate DCEU Outing...
",It's got charm. Similar to the first Shazam movie. Not the second one. Let's not talk about The Fury of the Gods. Susan Sarandon shows up at the start and the end. Earns her pay check. The female protagonist has this odd speech thing that sounds almost Dutch. The main guy has a family. They are all parts of his personality. It's actually the only subtle part of this movie until it isn't. Everything just seems too convenient. The actual premise is vague. We've got Scarabs and super powers and every trope there is. For a bit I thought it was just like a DC version of Iron Man. Susan Sarandon should really not be doing this type of movie. Let's hope Aquaman 2 can end this DCEU extravaganza properly.<br><br>Oh and the comedian Mexican guy is also in it. Not the one from Ant Man.,5
" A great adaptation of one of my favorite DC characters
","""Blue Beetle"" stands as an underdog with the troubled DC franchise and the character's modest popularity. However, it delivers a great, though not perfect take with a commendable message about family, and as a mexican viewer, I resonated with the character and the film in general.<br><br>While the focus on Jaime's family enhances character development, it overshadows the superhero element, giving us few action sequences and leaving gaps in explaining essential aspects, such as the scarab's origin and powers. I also feel like the relationship between Jaime and the scarab remained underexplored. Additionally, the antagonist's vague motivations and little sense of threat lack the depth needed to make a compelling villain.<br><br>I enjoyed the action sequences, which show creativity and great choreography, but as I said earlier, there are only a few. Visual effects and the suit design are really positive. In terms of humor, the film is a mix of hits and misses.<br><br>The cast is mostly meh, with the exception of Maridueña and Sarandon.<br><br>Overall, a fun experience with some issues, but I think the real problem is that the movie will be, unfairly, a box office failure in the midst of DC's struggles. Other than that, worth watching.",7
" What a nice surprise
","I walked into the theater expecting ""Blue Beetle"" to be just another run-of-the-mill, CGI-heavy superhero flick that leaned heavily into clichés, particularly after the cinematic trainwreck that was ""The Flash"". However, I couldn't have been more wrong.<br><br>From its very outset, the movie sets itself apart by placing family at the forefront. The genuine chemistry between the core family members is palpable and gives the film its heart and soul. Director Angel Manuel Soto beautifully maneuvers the storyline to ensure that it's a film about family first and a superhero origin story second. This unique perspective is not only refreshing but also allows the movie to carve its own niche in an otherwise saturated superhero film genre.<br><br>Xolo Maridueña of ""Cobra Kai"" fame delivers a standout performance, seamlessly blending humor, vulnerability, and action. The moments of humor are pitch-perfect, effortlessly eliciting laughter from the audience. Yet, what truly surprised me was how the movie, despite its superhero facade, managed to evoke genuine emotion, leading to an unexpected tear.<br><br>Drawing comparisons, the film's tone and content have shades of ""Upgrade"" and ""Venom"", particularly given the symbiotic relationship between the protagonist and the extraterrestrial entity. There's a distinct parallel in the family dynamics with the delightful ""Shazam"" movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed as well.<br><br>Visually, a notable mention goes to the decision to utilize a practical super suit in scenes where the protagonist isn't masked. This choice lends a tangible realism to the movie, making it stand out from those that rely heavily on CGI.<br><br>To clarify, ""Blue Beetle"" might not redefine cinematic excellence or be labeled a ""masterpiece"", but it most certainly is a well-acted, well-crafted film that promises - and delivers - a great time. A family movie at its core, with the added thrill of a superhero narrative, ""Blue Beetle"" is a movie experience I'd strongly recommend. And in a time where some superhero movies are missing the mark, this one hits its target with finesse.",8
" This one deserves more love!
","Went in not sure what to expect. I knew that because of the strike, the film hasn't done as well in the theaters. That said, this film was WELL DONE. It's funny (Spiderman like funny), but not overly dumb like Love and Thunder. There are really moving scenes that just get you emotionally. It is both a heartfelt and an action packed film. The heartfelt part ties its elements to current realities and historical events. The action packed... Well, it's just that.. action packed. Good fighting scenes, good use of technology references in it.<br><br>The storyline is well developed, with just enough backstory to help you make sense of it. Cannot recommend it enough!",8
" Painfully Unoriginal
","It's 2023, and the superhero movie is no longer new or a rare novelty. In truth, there have been so many over the last decade plus, that the typical formulas have all been seen dozens of times.<br><br>For fans of the source material, this version of the Blue Beetle is particularly galling. Rather than the 1939 original (yes, that old), or the better known and written second version, Ted Kord (who does at least get some references in the film), we get a third, dull-as-dishwater incarnation, Jaimie Reyes.<br><br>Jamie is young, well-meaning, and as bland as possible, but he is also American Mexican, and THAT is the theme and focus of the movie. Being Mexican, while being in a kick-ass Mexican family, and referencing Mexican pop culture (songs and TV shows).<br><br>For those who believe a movie should focus on race above all else, Blue Beetle is a triumph. Alas, dissenting viewers ares likely to be bored, and grow disinterested as this limp film hits you with cliche then CGI, then more cliche, then more CGI etc... for 2+ hours.<br><br>Blue Beetle isn't true to it's source material, and manages to be predictable above all else. It's truly a wasted opportunity.",3

I miss Zack Snyder's vision now more than ever cause in that universe, DC had its own identity, and wasn't trying to ape the competition.<br><br>This movie is another reason why I support DC hitting the restart button with James Gunn.

","This movie has just about zero surprises. The plot is cookie-cutter, the acting is mostly fine, but nothing particularly special. The humor is meh, the antagonists are meh. The best thing this film has going for it are its stunning visuals. It has great cinematography and production design, the city of Palmera is incredible just to look at. The great CGI is a nice break from what The Flash gave us a few months previous.<br><br>The story is fairly engaging and funny, but not particularly compelling. There weren't many crazy twists or layered plot points, and it was quite predictable. Enjoyable setup, leading to a payoff that was decent at best.<br><br>The musical score is in a class of its own and definitely adds plenty of emotion to the scenes. It has some really powerful moments that make the film more enjoyable.<br><br>Looking back at the film, there were no performances from any of the actors that particularly stuck out, but I'd go far enough to say that the acting has consistent quality, and never pulled me out of the viewing experience.<br><br>In closing, it was a lighthearted, funny, fun-filled adventure about a reluctant young superhero, but calling it more than a popcorn film would be generous.",7
" It passed the time...
","Blue Beetle does little to impress as far as superhero movies go. Now, we might decide to ""not take it seriously"" and just enjoy the film as a feel-good super-powered adventure, but we've gotten better movies of that nature.<br><br>For example, DC's very own ""Shazam!"" Interestingly, both films make family a prominent theme in their plot and it proves to be a bankable choice once again. There is a beautiful family dynamic on display here that is hard to deny.<br><br>The movie falls back on the protagonist's family for most of its comedic content too. However, more often than not, the jokes unfortunately don't land for me. They might come in the form of harmless antics and cheesy lines, but I don't think they really cater to a more mature audience due to their simplicity and lack of originality.<br><br>The events in the film are equally unimpressive to me because of how recycled everything feels. We've seen too many elements of this story in other superhero movies, and so Blue Beetle's character starts to lose his uniqueness besides the suit (which we learn too little about). It makes me begin to question the point of telling this story.<br><br>Thankfully, the visual and special effects in this film are one of its positives. The suits and tech on display are deliciously detailed and the fight scenes are choreographed quite well. It makes the action scenes really engaging.<br><br>Summarily, I think Blue Beetle had the potential to be better. I don't know what the vision for the film was, but what we get is a bit underwhelming.",6
" This movie is fine, what's with the terrible reviews!?
","Blue beetle is average. I still gave it an 8/10, because it had a great story, great fight scenes, amazing comedy, and perfect dc references. Why I found it average though, was because it had too much Mexican dialogue, and jokes, and it took too long for anything exciting to happen. For most of it, I thought this is worse then quantamania, but the last hour made me change my mind. And I didn't hate quantamania, it's just it was very mid, and it was the worst superhero movie I had seen in a while. This one seems like more of a kids movie, I have to admit I am a kid myself, but I watched it with my friends, and they loved it. However all of these reviews I just read, hated it. We also came across a little boy with his Mum, and he gave it a 10/10, but his mum gave it an 8. I see why the kids prefer it, it does have a lot of g rated jokes, and it's not very violent compared to other dc movies. So yeah to sum it up, I would recommend this movie, but I'd say your more likely to enjoy it if your under 18.",8
" Not mind-blowing, but definitely underrated
","My expectations going in to this movie was that it was going to be just ok and not anything that good. Thankfully I was mistaken, because Blue Beetle is honestly a very fun time. It has some really great elements, but is pretty generic for the most part. This movie feels like a mix between the original Iron Man and Spider-Man in terms of it's writing. With that said, I like how grounded this movie feels in terms of its stakes. So many of the superhero movies are about saving the multiverse, the world, whatever. Jaime's main motivation is protecting his family. Speaking of the family they are built as characters extremely well. They really do feel like a family, and you start to really care for them. To the point where I may or may not have cried during multiple intervals of this movie. The emotional stuff is done so well, and the CGI doesn't suck! It's a shame that decent CGI is the goal for superhero movies now a days. Also George Lopez is absolutely hysterical in this movie, he's a riot. Another downside is the villain, who is super boring and really just reeks of Iron Man. The whole movie reeks of Iron Man, not necessarily in a bad way, but it just makes the movie feel all the more generic. In a period of ""superhero fatigue"" doesn't help the movie at all. Overall I think it's a very enjoyable time, with fun character moments, and some great emotional beats. It's a shame that this movie will bomb, because this is the best DC movie I have seen in a long time.",8
" Awesome story and great visuals
","Now I'm not a blue beetle fan from before. The main reason I know of this character is from smallville show called Booster back in early 2000s. (Not the best episodes) Coming to this as a beginner, I really enjoyed the story behind it. The love for family and as a refresher and def made me have the feels being a Latin person myself. We do everything for family and this was awesome to see. The visuals for the movie was also very well done. It didn't feel like they cheaped out on putting together a good movie. The movie was funny, imaginative, and emotional. Great touch on casting George Lopez as uncle Rudy. He made that part fantastic and added an awesome touch to the movie.",10
" Fun experience at best !
","Another superhero movie ?! Well that's a shock ! But this one was ok ! Not as amazing as the critics think it is ! Classic storyline and mirror similarities to the concept of the fast and furious franchise !<br><br>To start off proceedings, I thought the casting choices were great, highlighting the Hispanic culture and the chemistry was excellent among the cast ! Along with light hearted moments and wacky moments at times, it was fun !<br><br>Nevertheless, I felt the movie could have done even more with the action sequences and felt it was too soft and predictable! Although, the sequences didn't really delivered to the heights of a classic super hero movie ! The last post credit scene was a bit unnecessary and completed moved away from the main plot of this movie.<br><br>Despite this, it was fun and I really enjoyed the humour and the soundtrack choices was well done but plenty room for improvement for future outings !",7
" Parts were perfect
","This movie was predictable, campy and suffered from glaring plot holes, but got damn it was fun to watch. Some moments were cinematic perfection, others had me physically angry.<br><br>What this movie does well, it has done better than any other DC movie. What it does poorly is still better than most of the DCU.<br><br>The score was amazing and most of the cast turned in fantastic performances.<br><br>I have very few complaints, it was funny relatable and sets up a sequel very nicely. I would definitely watch a sequel to this movie.<br><br>The end of the movie felt as cinematic as a gut wrenching cut scene from a masterpiece like Mass Effect.",9
" Enjoyable entertaining what more can you ask of a superhero movie?
","I enjoyed this type of super hero...which reminded me of the character Flash...or Shazam...has this super hero is chosen by an outsider and/or is hill equipped for the task at hand. He has to grow, to mature. It also reminded me of Mexican comic with the humour, the black or white ...super good or super evil... It plays also on the American misperceptions of the Mexican, &amp; South American by extension, all the stereotypes are used. The rhythm is good, no down time. Of course the colour are very now neon pastel touch everywhere, the acting is good...done well with in the limit of the stereotyping ...nice little touch of an ode to the Terminator with the Nana.",8
" Rename and Redo....
","Looks like the age group of this movie is 5yo-15yo..
Movie should be renamed as Blue Scarab which sounds way better than beetle and have the movie redone to more of a young adult to adult and make it actually be a better movie/story.<br><br>It's like power rangers meets robocop meets most disney kid shows...
Like most movies now, special affects are good, but is destroyed by crappy story line...
Plus the beginning shows more than one Scarab flying through space and different colours...
What movie does that remind me of?<br><br>🤔
Oh yes, Avengers...
Infinity stones all different colours flying through space...",2
" give this movie a shot
","Great movie overall. I enjoyed watching it. The movie hilarious at times. Other times it might've tried a little too hard, but overall most of the attempted jokes made, landed. The movie was also very endearing and touching(some might even say tear inducing). Family was a very big aspect of the movie, and the family in this movie was portrayed very well. The family felt very genuine. The final villain maybe felt a little underwhelming, but i don't really know what i was expecting in terms of the villain or the final fight. Overall most of the main characters are very like-able, some more than others. That being said i would definitely recommend. The sound track is also amazing. Good job to whoever choose the songs. Overall 10/10.",10
" Weak ass spiderman wanna be
","At first, I was hyped but as I watched further it became obvious this movie wanted to be as witty as spiderman and as bad ass as batman but failed to do both.<br><br>A weak ass scared and pacifist main character who didn't want to even fight to protect his own loves ones? Then suddenly turn character 180 degrees after seeing some tech with no background story is weak as hell.<br><br>This kind of plot might work in a masked rider series, but even then the masked rider series would still have more depth and background story to the characters.<br><br>Whoever wrote the script should reconsider tbeir choice of career.",2
" Sick of superhero flicks, but I actually enjoyed this!
","I didn't want to watch another superhero movie. But it's the summer holidays, and kids want to go to the cinema. So I grabbed some food and drink and expected to snore through yet another superhero movie. At least i'd enjoy some food huh..<br><br>But I was pleasantly surprised!<br><br>This movie is colourful, yet gritty.<br><br>Fun yet emotional.<br><br>Dream-like yet realistic.<br><br>The way our protagonist changes into the blue beetle is done in such a way, it's kind of difficult to watch.<br><br>Gaining a power like this and turning into a bug-powered superhero wouldn't be a comfortable transition and this film captures that brilliantly.<br><br>I'm not a Latino, but being from an Asian background, there's definitely some similarities. The love and support of the protagonist's family is refreshing to watch. His family stick by him through thick and thin and it was truly wonderful to see. This film has some heart and soul that is not present in many other similar movies.<br><br>It's a refreshing take on the tired superhero genre which is on its last legs. It was very fun to watch and also makes you sympathise with many of the characters.<br><br>If this was a marvel movie, it would've recieved a higher rating. I don't know why DC is judged so harshly.<br><br>This was the best superhero film I have seen in quite a while. Give it a go if you like this genre. It's better than the usual snoozefests that fill up a cinema screen.",8
" Why is this getting bad reviews?
",Blue Beetle is hands down one of my favorite DC movies. George Lopez stole the show. CGI was great unlike the previous DC The Flash. It took the Fast &amp; Furious approach aspect in that it's all about family. DC delivers again on the big bad. The villains is one thing DC always does well. The jokes landed very well. I'd watch this multi times in theaters. It might make gangbusters at the box office but if this is the direction that James Gunn and Peter Safran want to take the rebooted DCU then I am 100% on board(not that I already was). It also felt like Shazam in the way that Billy Batson struggled in his new life as a super hero.,8
" New superhero, same cliched narrative
","The world of superhero movies has now entered the point of diminishing returns. Be it MCU or DCEU, there's hardly any new momentum that makes you wanna 'shiver with anticipation (to borrow a line from Dr Frank-N-furter.)<br><br>And Blue Beetle clearly lands into that puddle of mud. It borrows narrative tropes that we've seen before, from Spiderman, Shazam, Venom. That includes allusions to political correctness that is the craze now in Hollywood. If you go in expecting some level of originality, then you will be disappointed. Plot parts revolving around family, Uncle Ben-type scenes, down on his luck boy-meet-pretty-girl, symbiotic aliens, the funny uncle - it's all there. Which for the discerning viewer, feels more like a cut and paste job from the scriptwriters instead of aiming for something fresh.<br><br>It also feels that the director threw realism out the window in order to meet room for the fun aspect, the jokes. Consider for e.g. The meekly Reyes family turning into an Stallone-Expendable level rescue team five minutes after experiencing tragedy, or that Uncle Rudy suddenly becomes an expert at flying an aircraft with alien tech, or small bodied grandma Nana holding a behemoth-sized weapon reminiscent of the Terminator's M143 minigun, or, ""Your house is full of love"", notices Jaime's soon-to-be love interest; duly arriving at said conclusion after spending hardly more than 10 minutes meeting his family for the first time.<br><br>You then wish that at least they would throw in villains who weren't one dimensional. Instead, that too lands in the territory of cliched bad guys, with Sarandon being the chief culprit, playing a boring villain spewing lines that would make Austin Power's screenplay sound like Oscar material. How does an Oscar winner come down to this level? The cheque must have been terrific, I guess.<br><br>Some of the acting fall short. Apart from George Lopez, I can't say the others were memorable.<br><br>In short, Blue Beetle won't be the movie that would revive DCEU's fortune.",5
" new Latin angles on Spiderman
","My guess is everyone will respond to this pretty much the same way they responded to the Disney+ Kamala Khan Ms. Marvel series (filled with creative juice; yet, off the beaten path for white people). The good news is all tropes old and new are executed with 100% energy and vitality, which says a lot about the teamwork of all concerned.<br><br>Its entertainment value is enhanced by the new Latin angles on Spiderman; including, a smiling anti-Imperialist Grandma. Ha!<br><br>Geore Perez is useful as the lead acts as the normal ""foil"" for the wacky supporting cast around him.<br><br>The VFX are top-drawer delivering even more visceral Iron-Man vs Iron-Man melee combat and body slamming impacts.<br><br>I liked the female lead. Susan Saradan has eh job of anchoring the villainous energy and commits fully despite the tropes she is saddled with.<br><br>While I get the creators' focus has to be on the origin story, to me BB seems too powerful. Who else can he fight except Superman?",8
" The first half of the film is absolutely great
","The first half of the film is absolutely great, then it degenerates into total garbage. The only praiseworthy thing is the CGI. They are better than Flash or Black Adam! The plot is totally cliché laden and incredibly uncreative! The 2 post credit scenes are also meaningless! Normally he would get 5 points from me because he amused me after all, he got another weak star from me. A character with a lot of untapped potential. DC (Warner) doesn't want and doesn't want to be creative, just make a quick buck. I have hope that James Gunn will turn things around and make the DC universe what the MCU used to be. From now on, I will avoid DC films in the cinema for the time being, there hasn't been a single one that has really convinced me! Except for the first two Man of Steel movies. Let's see what James Gunn makes of it!",6

" He's the First Superhero in his Family
",I am happy that Latinos are finally getting roles as superheroes. For some reason we were always overlooked. Few actors like Ricardo Montalban could achieve super stardom.<br><br>Now a new generation of young actors are getting their chance to shine. I applaud Warner Brothers and DC Comics for being more inclusive to minority groups.<br><br>This movie is a typical action/sci-fi movie filled with special effects. Overall it was very funny and I enjoyed every aspect of it. Xolo Maridueña as the hero Jaime Reyes did a beautiful performance as a young college graduate struggling to find work. George Lopez is there to support the younger cast members.<br><br>One thing was missing and that was a blue Volkswagen Beetle. Instead a Toyota Tacoma is prominently featured.,8
" DC hasn't been great, but this was
","I'm not entirely sure why there was so much hate for this movie. Xolo Maridueña was great. If you watched Cobra Kai at all then you can see how far Xolo has come as an actor. He did a great job in this film.<br><br>There were definite moments where it felt like Iron Man, or Spider-Man, or even Black Panther, but for the most part Blue Beetle stands on it's own. Is it another super hero movie? Absolutely! This movie is meant to be a super hero movie, but this is the type of super hero movie we've all been asking for and they finally provided it. The last 6 DC films were trash, but this is what we we've hoping for. At this point though, I feel like everyone is tired of super hero movies and did not quite understand the Latino culture in the film. There seemed to be a lot of jokes that were made if you have a Latino background. Since I have somewhat lived in that culture, a lot of things might have stood out to me more as funny than someone who doesn't speak Spanish or has not been immersed in that culture. (If you haven't, it's an incredibly beautiful culture and would highly recommend it).<br><br>The sense of family that Latino's have goes beyond Fast and the Furious and they did a great job of showing that family dynamic in this movie. The movie did a great job of representation as well. It's rare to see this kind of representation in super hero films and as a white American, it's always great to see other cultures and races represented in this way.<br><br>Nana was a fun character and if you know her acting history it makes her character that much more fun.<br><br>George Lopez's character plays that crazy fun loving uncle and he really fits in his role. He made the movie that much more enjoyable with all his quirks.<br><br>Lastly, if you're sick of super hero movies in general, I would not recommend this movie to you. But if you're a fan of any of the characters I mentioned above, this is a fun and entertaining movie. Solid 8/10.",8
" A Classic Movie to Kick off a new Universe
","Blue beetle is one of the dc best movie since Zack Snyder. The patient of this movie was good. I really liked the family dynamic in this movie. Xolo killed his role as blue beetle in this movie. Jenny Kord was an amazing supporting character in this movie. The villain was kind of generic, but was still one of the best parts of this movie. I like his suit and the advancement of his suit. Victoria Kord was surprisingly OK, expected more from an award winning actress, but performance still good. I am looking forward to this movie sequels and hopefully James Gunn uses more of him in his DC projects 🔥🙏🏻. Overall love this movie would see it again.",8
" A good 1st swing, but a sequel is needed to perfect
","BLUE BEETLE was a good first-swing, being the first Latino-driven superhero movie. It's not perfect, but it's definitely a good first swing.<br><br>A star is born. Xolo Mariduena delivers a charming, charismatic and vulnerable performance in the way that Toby Maguire does in Spider-Man (2002).<br><br>George Lopez gives a torch-passing performance that shows what luminaries of his caliber should do for the next generation of actors. He was funny and cynosure without upstaging his fellow cast members.<br><br>Alternatively, Susan Sarandon was not needed. She delivers a carbon copy villain that we've all seen 1000 times. It was bland and too familiar. She added nothing special in a culturally historic film targeting Latinos around the world.<br><br>Her role should have gone to an actor with Mexican ancestry -- Hayek, Trejo, Longoria, Olmos -- someone with as high a public profile as Sarandon. I think they would've brought more depth as Jaime Reyes' supervillain and helped fill more theater seats.<br><br>Unfortunately, Blue Beetle is going to come in under $30M at the weekend domestic box office, which is a shame.

" Who was this for?
","As a Latino i was excited that Xolo Maridueña would be playing a Latino superhero, albeit a lesser known character. I saw it with my family and..What the Heck? Ok, so i thinking this was made for the Power Rangers demographic, young kids. All though it was fun at times, I could not recommend this movie. It had all the Latino cliches, typical hard life story, typical super hero story and the music was overkill. Who wrote this? It was a Mexican born Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. Now does he think all Latinos are Mexican? Hollywood obliviously doesn't know to include all Latino cultures into a Latino movie. Very few films have been done like that. Also including George Lopez in the mix was another reason I didn't see the film in the theater. My opinion but I don't care for him. This was disappointing all the way thru. We were saying ""This is like watching Spy Kids"" . But that was a better movie with the same strong family message. I like the optimistic strong family that stays together message. This seemed like it was made not for a wide theatrical release. More like made for TV. Xolo Maridueña did a good job and I hope he gets more roles in better movies. But these stereotypical Latino movies do not represent us as a people. Again Hollywood is to blame. As for DC, I'm a long time DC comics fan. If they thought this was going to bring more fans to their side, what were they thinking?",4
" Fun and full of heart
","'Blue Beetle' is a fairly by-the-book superhero origin story featuring some cool action and one of the best practical comic book movie suits I've ever seen. Xolo Maridueña is perfect in the title role as Jaime Reyes, and much like Jaime himself, the film's greatest strength is his family. Each member brings something distinct and special to the table, making the movie a joy to watch. However, the two villains are pretty generic and Susan Sarandon's acting is as believable as Bigfoot's existence. Overall, it's a fun movie with a lot of heart, delivering a solid cinematic debut for an awesome character.",8
" Blue beetle sometimes is a bite you can't itch but it's not bad
","So I first saw this advertised on another social media all singing all dancing app and it was a scene where he first became blue beetle and let me tell you I said yes, this is me..as a lover of any type of origin superhero movies I was sold and that one film showed promise.<br><br>So after was I disappointed? Yes and no.. I felt the blue beetle scenes themselves when in action was good but I think I wanted more and he got too fast used to what he was as did his family. I loved the action scenes, I liked a little bit of the humour but no real laugh out loud moments. I liked the characters..nobody was super annoying but in terms of believability? Lets just say a couple of them you think yeah no I'm not buying it.<br><br>At 2 hours long I don't think it necessarily felt it but at times the non action bits felt slow and to me didn't add anything to the film but I guess they wanted to drive home the message about family which yeah in a super hero movie we don't want that all the way through and to be the main focus in each part of the film again and again.<br><br>I liked the guy chosen for blue beetle but he was still unremarkable I think anyone could have played him..I won't certainly remember his face after I have left the cinema. His romantic interest a pretty face but again forgettable.<br><br>I think definitely more could have been done.. it was your basic storyline and it has been played out in so many other movies.<br><br>Would I like a sequel? Possibly. I think I would like it if he was a superhero in all the sense of the word and a bigger landscape fighting villains and definitely more of the blue beetle in action as I quite liked the suit and what it can do although it does seem like it can do too much and it left me wondering what time this was set in because the tech was so much and advance it was like right let's make it do this and that and all shiny and bright but don't necessarily make it better. One thing worth noting I think I never had the belief that the boy was anything until activating powers in the suit I never really truely felt they were combined as they led us to believe like a lot of other superheros.<br><br>So worth a visit to the cinema? Well if love super heroes then why not but will it leave you wanting more...possibly if we get more of blue beetle and try and develop blue beetle more then just a kid in a suit he loves his family. Would I go watch a sequel..possibly.",7
" Stands strong with the best of the DC movies
","I'm officially dubbing Blue Beetle as the Mexican Spider-Man. He's unsure of himself as a superhero and a young man. He's funny, a little geeky, and holds back from executing when given the opportunity. Where he differs a bit is the family dynamic and the support he gets from each member throughout the movie.<br><br>The movie itself is fun and funny, packed with action and jokes, heartfelt moments between his love interest and within the family. When you combine all these elements, you get a character that really start to emotionally invest in, a movie that keeps you entertained, and a soundtrack that sneaks in some really great songs in English and Spanish. The 80's vibe you get from the movie is amazing, but not overwhelming.<br><br>For Mexicans/Latin Americans, this is our hero. Don't let the jokes and stereo types offend you, it portrays Mexican familia in a positive light. Blue Beetle could be a great addition to James Gunn's new DC as a key character to help carry this universe.",9

This movie isn't bad but I expected something really good for the start of a whole new dcu.even tho it was boring it doesn't deserve all the hate it's still could be enjoyable for viewers but for me it didn't capture the magic the old movies used to have more tried something new and fun.6/10 watch with your family you'll have a good time.,6

" Very genuine movie about family.
","Honestly wasn't planning on reviewing this one despite liking it, but after seeing so many negative and quite unfairly critical ones I felt the need to get my own opinion on here.<br><br>I'll start by giving a brief plot synopsis.<br><br>The movie centers around Jaime Reyes, a recent collage graduate coming back to his home in Palmera City only to discover that things aren't the same as when he left. Things aren't going well for his family so he vows to get his family out of their situation. He manages to get a job offer from Jenny Kord but when he comes to meet her she instead giver her the Scarab, an ancient piece of alien technology. Jaime is tasked with protecting it but the thing instead bonds to his spine and transforms him into the superhero, Blue Beetle.<br><br>Let's start with the positives:<br><br><ul><li>The Cast, this is the films strongest element. All the characters are extremely likable and the Reyes family dynamic is the highlight of the film. Everyone gives out a great performance, Xolo Maridueña is an excellent leading man, and he really feels like Jaime Reyes and is perfect casting. George Lopez is also excellent, and very funny as Jaime's paranoid uncle Rudy. Bruna Marquezine plays Jenny Kord, Jaime's love interest, and a hero in her own right. The final actor I want to talk about is Damián Alcázar who plays Jaime's father, he is excellent in the role and gives of a very emotional performance.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>The visual effects, This is the best looking superhero movie this year in terms of effects. I believe the reason for this is that a lot of the movie is practical so the few visual effects that are, have all the effort put into them to make them look as clean as possible.

" A MARVELized DC film..but still fun...
","In a era where Superhero movies became part of our daily life it's hard to see Blue Beetle and not to compare it with several other superhero origin story movies.. I think this movie is very similar to Iron Man 2008 and Venom 2018 in many aspects of story and characters..Xolo Maridueña is a good actor I loved seeing him in my favorite show of all time Cobra Kai, here he played role of a Superhero very brilliantly. Bruna Marquezine looks very hot n sexy on screen and her role is same one as many other female characters play in many superhero movies to help our hero and become his love interest. Lol
Action wise this movie is good there are 2 big fight scenes between blue beetle and main villain OMAC which are great rest of action includes jumping, running and kicking bad guys while shooting blasts from hand.. Visuals are good Palmera City looks like a futuristic city from video games rest of world feels alive and filled with bright colors. Soundtrack was good especially Blue Beetle theme.. Story wise this movie feels cliche filled (Guy gets superpowers, bad guys chase him and kidnaps his family, villain comes and best hero badly and finally hero overcomes his weakness by power of love and defeats the villain meanwhile he gets a girl who kisses her at end and they live happily after. Lol)..
There is also some forced sense of humor like McU..<br><br>Overall Blue Beetle is a enjoyable movie which you can see or skip it's upto you..it's nothing special just wait for it to arrive online..
Despite whatever James Gunn said about blue beetle being first DCU character this is still connected to original DCEU and Henry Cavill's Superman and Ben Affleck's Batman are mentioned in the story there is also a reference to Ezra Miller's Flash makes you wonder What James Gunn is doing at DC and how poorly David Zaslav destroyed this universe when he could've saved it and used these movies to further hype up next installments.. But their poor move is blowing back on them this movie is also a big disaster at arrival. . Sequel or not I won't care even if this is last apperance of these characters. Lol.",6
" Awful!!!
","The individual responsible for churning out this abomination should seriously contemplate a career change, one that involves absolutely no association with the film industry whatsoever. Let's delve into this cinematic catastrophe, shall we? Brace yourself for a litany of lamentation as I dissect every wretched aspect of this atrocity.<br><br>First and foremost, the plot is an exercise in abject mediocrity. It's as if the screenwriter took a nap halfway through and decided to just roll with the most insipid and uninspired narrative elements possible. The result? A plot so devoid of creativity that even the most dedicated fans of mind-numbing tedium would struggle to find any redeeming qualities.<br><br>Now, let's talk about the characters - or should I say, the vapid caricatures that grace the screen. These characters are not just your run-of-the-mill dull; they are remarkably, unbelievably, and profoundly stupid. Their actions and decisions defy logic and common sense to such an extent that you'll find yourself questioning the very fabric of reality.<br><br>The dialogues, if you can even call them that, are about as generic as a cardboard box. It's as if the scriptwriters employed a random word generator to craft the lines, resulting in exchanges so devoid of wit, depth, or originality that you'll be pining for the days of Shakespearean prose.<br><br>And then we arrive at the acting. Oh, the acting. If you could even call it that. The performances in this travesty of cinema are so wretchedly poor that you'd be forgiven for thinking you stumbled upon a community theater production gone horribly wrong. It's as if the cast was instructed to channel their inner wooden planks, with every emotion delivered in a painfully forced and unconvincing manner.<br><br>The only semblance of redemption in this cinematic abyss lies in the special effects. I suppose if you're the type of viewer who derives satisfaction from pretty lights and flashy explosions, then congratulations, you've found your silver lining. But even the special effects can't salvage this sinking ship; they merely serve as a shiny distraction from the underlying ineptitude.<br><br>To liken the acting in this film to that of a ""cheap TV series"" would be an insult to the multitude of talented actors who grace the small screen. No, this is a level of performance that can only be equated to the most bottom-tier, bargain-bin productions, where thespian skills seem to be optional.<br><br>The entire film feels like a mind-numbing descent into the depths of idiocy. It's as if the creators took inspiration from the lowest quality, brainless cartoons and decided to replicate that asinine formula on the big screen. As the film trudges on, it only becomes increasingly moronic, pushing the boundaries of absurdity and leaving the audience in a state of bewilderment.<br><br>At some point during this cinematic train wreck, I found myself teetering on the precipice of anger. Yes, anger. Anger at the audacity of subjecting viewers to this festival of imbecility. It's a genuine affront to the intelligence of anyone unfortunate enough to have wasted precious minutes of their life on this abomination.<br><br>I had such high hopes for ""Blue Beetle,"" but what a colossal letdown it turned out to be. In comparison to this travesty, even the most maligned entries in the DC film universe shine like beacons of cinematic excellence. This film isn't just bad; it's a new benchmark for cinematic incompetence, a testament to the depths to which a movie can sink in its quest to be utterly dreadful.",1

" A disappointing mess...
","I really wanted to like blue beetle man... It had a great RT score and solid metacritic score beforehand and a lot of people were saying the movie was pretty great but unfortunately I just couldn't get into it. I'll start off with the positives: Blue beetle is a fun character and the actor is going a great job and I would love to see him in a better film! Some of the action was quite cool and I think the soundtrack was quite good, The whole family dynamic was also very nice and definitely added a unique flare to the film that set it apart from other movies. And last of all I think the uncle character had some pretty funny jokes ""It went up his --"" was probably the funniest joke in the movie. And I also really liked the transformation scene and the shot of his eyes reflected on that painting was GREAT! But unfortunately that's about it when it comes to positives... Let's begin the negatives. Cons: The villains suck! The corporate villain is incredibly boring and her motivation is as bland as a plank of wood. Carapax had some cool action scenes but he was never that menacing and he literally had no backstory until the last like 10 minutes and then that said backstory was literally flashed over in less than a minute and now we're supposed to feel sorry for him? Literally 5 minutes before this he killed an innocent man but we got 20 seconds of backstory so you gotta care about him cause he's a good guy and he teamed up with blue beetle nowI also HATED how Jaime got the scarab, Jenny didn't even know Jaime but he decided to give her the most powerful weapon in the world to him and told him not to open it! You don't know him, How do you know if he's trustworthy? What if he just gave he scarab to the bad guys? What was your plan, It's such a contrived way to get his powers and they easily could've found a more sensical way to do it but no we have to rush to the powers scene because the film's pacing is atrocious! You have an action scene and then there's like 30 minutes of downtime to the next action scene and it makes the movie exhausting to watch and it's most definitely to skimp on the budget! This movie only cost 100 million and was originally supposed to be on HBO max and you can definitely see why. The film's effects are pretty abysmal at time and there's very few extras to make the city feel alive, Even Netflix movies feel more big-budget than this! The overall plot was incredibly boring and it felt like a mish mash of every other superhero movie but done so much worse. Now I said earlier that I really liked the soundtrack which was mainly composed of authentic Latino music and it was great but then sometimes they just played random American music and it completely messed with the tone, It feels like they put a random soundtrack on shuffle and it DOES NOT WORK. And the whole final battle was genuinely atrocious, The movie was kinda okay before it but then the final battle happened and it completely killed the movie! In the whole movie blue beetle has this no killing rule and he even has conflict with the suit about killing carapax but for whatever reason he's fine with other people killing bad guys?!? His grandma literally takes out a gun and murders a bunch of guards and blue beetle just stands there and does nothing. And then carapax blows himself up to kill corporate lady and blue beetle does nothing and yeah let's talk about that scene. Why did carapax need to kill himself? It was not established beforehand but okay he wants do a suicide.. WHY DOES HE BLOW HIMSELF UP IF HE KNOWS BLUE BEETLE IS THERE WHY NOT JUST SHOOT Corporate LADY AND THEN SHOOT YOURSELF YOU DID NOT NEED TO BLOW YOURSELF UP BECAUSE BLUE BEETLE ALMOST DIED THAT WAS SO STUPID! And the final thing I didn't like in the movie was the final post credits scene, We waited 5 minutes in the theatre for like a 5 second gag that we already saw in the movie! Overall I was incredibly disappointed by this movie and it sucks cause I was kinda enjoying the first half with Jaime and his family just vibing but as soon as the plot took over and Jaime became blue beetle the movie dropped off incredibly hard and we get is a disjointed mess filled with some cool aspects and some terrible stuff as well. I don't think it's awful but it's still a pretty bad film and I wouldn't even recommend for some dumb action fun cause there isn't even enough action for that! There's like 3 action scenes in the whole movie and the rest is just boring exposition and quote on quote ""Emotional Moments"". The dad's death scene was absolutely hilarious, He died in the most melodramatic way and combined with the terrible acting of the sister screaming over his body with the genuinely comedic timing of the house's explosion makes for a disjointed mess of a scene... Kinda like the movie! 4/10.",4
" Possibly the most generic superhero film ever.
","Blue Beetle is possibly one of the most generic superhero films i've ever watched in my life.<br><br>It follows a teen who gains superpowers from a mystical artifact, who must protect it from an evil business tycoon, along the way learning about family or whatever.<br><br>To get the positives out the way so I can properly rag on this film. The film has a few good jokes, the CGI is not too overused, the world building of Palmera city is great &amp; (most) of the fight scenes are pretty entertaining.<br><br>However the film has a pace that absolutely crawls, it's charterers range from tolerable to unbearably obnoxious and the actually good actors, like Harvey Guillén are shunted to the side to make way for bland love interests and quippy comic relief characters.<br><br>The films central family has two interesting &amp; fun characters and the rest make me want to drink antifreeze, it became a genuine pain to pay attention to the film, because every single sodding scene has one of his family members doing an oh-so-funny scream.<br><br>But I think this movies primary sin is how unremarkable it is.

" DC's Latin Hero is pretty generic...
","The mashup powers of a super hero that got a lot his colleagues similar strengths work fine for kids. My 11 years old had a great time with it, but I was closer to sleep than saber any moments from this one to the collection of great comic genre films.<br><br>Its fine. Its OK and even not bad and a little bit funny. It has its moments and it really want to be progressive with his Latin-American audience.

It probably will be even more progressive and satisfying for its audience, but I have to say that it is not a bad or crappy movie - just mediocre to its core.<br><br>HBO Max should have released it but Money came to the path and though not sure this character and its plot will move on to DC's next stage, the captains of DC saw an opportunity to grab cash from their audience and there we are - instead of getting out in a smaller screen it came out to the movie theatres. Not justified, but hey...there are worse and this one also could get a lot worse.",6
" Missed opportunity
","Massive, Massive disappointment.<br><br>Some great actors but some terrible, terrible characters. - special shout out to the completely unlikeable sister who I'm sure on script was supposed to be witty and sassy but in film comes off as an UTTER liability on top of being actively mean spirited and lacking any self awareness by trying to sabotage her brother in both carrier and romance endeavours. (not the actors fault and again I doubt that's the intention of the authors but they were trying to push the family fish out of water dynamic and the sister just seems to have it dialled up to 11)
For the most part the actors bring their A game, Xolo making a likeable protagonist and does the best with what he's given and Susan Sarandon brining her best bad guy boss lady even if occasionally she seems to be almost channelling Sigourney Weaver and the entire character arc of the main dragon is expodumped in about 45 seconds (by design) which is a bit of a shame because he's a little 1 dimensional up to that point.<br><br>The main problem the movie has though is that anything that differentiates the character is completely beige and watered down to protect the PG rating when it really could have been served by adding a little more peril (in fact it's far tamer then Black Adam even though they have the same cert in the UK so the first transformation takes what seems to be a horrifically painful body horror transformation as his body literally morphs into the beetle armour with attachments growing out of his body turns into a muddled CGI mess interspersed with his family doing their best pewdepie / mark kalplar reacts faces, any tension and drama is completely sapped and then it's followed by a bad remake of the Iron might learns to fly sequence........ (more of that later) which then resolves into a super fast and santisised sequence of him morphing back to almost human but with the alien graphed onto his body but that's barely an inconvenience.<br><br>Then there is the action sequences: sadly there is a very strong reliance on ""homaging"" MCU movies with a few sequences being more or less remakes of MCU sequences, iron man first flight for example and the shang chi bus bisection another, even the blue beetles ship gave me da ja vu of Archie from watchmen (also why, the blue beetle suit can fly and take him to space, and conjuror any weapon he can imagine so dafuq does he need a ship for?) and what little new ideas the movie has of it's own or at at least when it's mixing it up to feel new still feels lacking in any punch of steaks like creating a pair of spinning cudgels and then going beast mode in a corrie smashing mooks up and literally pinning them to the ceiling with his beetle claw appendage things.... all devoid of blood or even sound effects that convey and punch or weight.... it feels so.... bland.<br><br>It's also painfully predicable...
It's one big missed opportunity and I can't even say it was the John Carpenter effect in play as while this character dates back to the 1930's in this case it's very much leaning on paths forced by much newer brethren.",4
" Definitely see this in theaters! Xolo IS the Blue Beetle!
","Definitely see this in theaters! Xolo IS the Blue Beetle!<br><br>Greatly enjoyed this movie. It had so much heart. It had family love. It had the action. Ok, some parts were corny.... But it didn't bother me. I love a FUN superhero movie. But this has heart. I cried, a few times. Some of sorrow some of joy. But in the end, I laughs and smiled.<br><br>I thought it was well made and a fun film. Xolo does a great job in the titular role, I was worried because his character in Cobra Kai is kinda whiney, a little annoying; but not Jaime (his character in Blue Beetle) as he is older and I'd say more mature than his CK character. I definitely suggest seeing this in theatres!!!",8
" Beetling Past Expectations
","Blue Beetle, directed by the talented Ángel Manuel Soto, is a refreshing entry into the superhero genre. Defying the odds, it showcases that not all heroes need to belong to the 'A-list' to leave a mark on the audience.<br><br>From its very inception, the film promised to be unique, presenting the lesser-known but beloved Jaime Reyes (portrayed with gusto by Xolo Maridueña) as the titular Blue Beetle. The narrative beautifully dives deep into the rich tapestry of Latino culture, making it one of the first mainstream superhero movies to do so, and is anchored by Jaime's strong familial ties, which includes his charismatic father Alberto (Damián Alcázar) and an endearing conspiracy theorist uncle Rudy (George Lopez) among others.<br><br>The film's heart undoubtedly lies in its characters. Maridueña, in particular, exhibits moments of brilliance, hinting at a promising leading-man future. He takes us on a journey through Jaime's life post-college, with his earnest endeavor to support his family, leading to an unexpected tryst with the alien entity, the Scarab.<br><br>The storyline, though an origin tale, does not feel stale. Instead, Soto manages to weave a tapestry of emotional threads, using family as its fulcrum, making the stakes personal and thereby elevating the tension. The narrative's domestic undertones, blended with the larger-than-life superhero elements, create a harmonious balance that few movies achieve.<br><br>Furthermore, the film's commitment to diverse representation is commendable. Through genuine scenes where the characters just 'exist', the audience gets a genuine sense of Latino culture, adding depth and dimension to the narrative.<br><br>In terms of visual effects, Blue Beetle doesn't hold back. While the third act showcases CGI in its full glory, there's a seamless integration that keeps you engrossed in the narrative, rather than being distracted by the visual spectacle.<br><br>In essence, Blue Beetle emerges as a genuine surprise package, proving that with the right vision and execution, even lesser-known characters can make for gripping cinema. While it has its minor flaws, its heart, soul, and respect for the source material make it deserving of an 8/10.",8
" Typical, but Fun Superhero Movie
","Superhero shows are everywhere. They are inescapable. There are always shows based on Batman, Spiderman, Avengers, Justice League, etc.,. Then, last week, another one arrived in the form of the Blue Beetle - a superhero that I've never heard of until I started seeing the previews for this year's flick ""Blue Beetle"" directed by Angel Manuel Soto. Now that I've watched that film, I can say that I'm glad that I did because even though it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it certainly stands out from other superhero movies with its emphasis on heritage and family.<br><br>""Blue Beetle"" is about Jaime (pronounced Hi-may) Reyes (played by Xolo Maridueña) and how he becomes the titular superhero. An alien scarab chooses the recent college graduate to be its symbiotic host, providing him with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers. This forever changes his destiny.<br><br>Like I said before, I never heard of Blue Beetle until this film came out this year. I did some research, and it turns out that Jaime is the third person to have done the suit since the character first appeared in the DC Universe in 1939. The other two are Dan Garrett and Ted Kord, whose suits actually appear in the flick while Jaime, Jenny (Ted's daughter and played by Bruna Marquezine), and Uncle Rudy (played by George Lopez) explore Ted's lab. This is a nice and clever way to acknowledge the Blue Beetles who came before the current one.<br><br>The flick itself is not particularly innovative, which is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. While watching it, I noticed that it took elements from other superheroes films from the last 5-10 years. There always has to be romance even if it's not all that necessary. In this film, it's between Jaime and Jenny. The latter's aunt (played by Susan Sarandon) runs Kord Industries and is the main antagonist, but Jenny wants nothing to do with the company, especially ever since her father's disappearance. I get her involvement since she is the reason why the scarab gets into Jaime's hands, but I don't know if the romance was all that necessary. They could've developed a friendship based on justice and family. The sibling relationship between Jamie and his younger sister Milagro (played by Belissa Escobedo) is very reminiscent of that between T'Challa and his sister Shuri in the first ""Black Panther"" movie, mainly how annoying, blunt, smart, and loving the women are. It was still entertaining to see the siblings interact, especially when they are on the rooftop.<br><br>There are also tropes that are present in the film that audiences have definitely seen before. For example, there's a scene between Jaime and his recently deceased father Alberto (played by Damián Alcázar), in which the latter convinces the former that it's not his time while the superhero is on the brink of death. I'm sure there are many people who have watched similar scenes in other flicks like ""Black Panther."" In another example, the grandma Nana (played by Adriana Barraza) is a sweet old lady, but with a colorful past. The latter comes out when the family comes to rescue Jaime from the villains. Again, people have seen this before, but I enjoyed how Adriana fully commits to the part, especially when she yells, ""Down with the Imperialists!"" in Spanish.<br><br>Despite not being reinventive, ""Blue Beetle"" still has many things going for it: the Latine heritage and family. This film marks the first time that a Latino superhero has been depicted on screen, which Soto doesn't take lightly. The Latine experience is depicted in multiple ways in the flick. This ranges from the poor, but colorful neighborhood, in which the Reyes reside in, to the acknowledgement of systematic racism that Jaime and Milagro endure even though he has a college degree. My favorite is the soundtrack, which features plenty of Latine-inspired songs including ""Tú Serás Mi Baby"" - Spanish version of ""Be My Baby"" - by Juvented Crasa, which plays during a party thrown by the evil corporation Kord Industries with Latine waiters.<br><br>The strongest element that the movie has going is the theme of family. Jamie's means everything to him even if they drive him up the wall. Also, they may or may not inadvertently had a hand in the scarab choosing him. Besides that, what makes this work is the chemistry among the cast. They are insanely believable as a family because of how comfortable they are around each other, and the best scenes involve them in some form. In addition, there's a villain named Carapax (played by Raoul Max Trujillo) who taunts Jaime by saying that family makes him weak. Later, Jaime discovers Carapax's backstory, which involves his own kin and how he was abducted into war. This gives him understanding as well as the courage to say to the antagonist that family is what makes him strong and not to kill him. In addition, one of the first shots of the movie is of the necklace containing a photo that Carapax wears. It's later revealed that the picture is of his own family.<br><br>Because this is a superhero film, I have to talk about the performances. Xolo Maridueña, who is best known for his television work in ""Parenthood"" and ""Cobra Kai,"" is fine as the titular character. He has some charm and works best with the actors who play his family as well as in scenes where Jaime is struggling with his powers. If ""Blue Beetle"" gets a sequel, I would like to see him grow into the suit, uh I mean character. The standout performer of the movie is George Lopez, who plays the anarchist eccentric Uncle Rudy aka the Mexican Doc Brown. He infuses Rudy with elements from his standup comedy and surprisingly with a lot of heart. Also, I dig his long beard; it really suits the character.<br><br>All in all, while ""Blue Beetle"" may not be the most original superhero flick, it stands out in all the right places. Since it's the first movie with a Latino superhero, the film embraces its Latine heritage in every way. It's also at its most powerful when family is involved. It uses a lot of tropes from other movies, yet it executes them in a delightful way. I would recommend this movie to those who love superheroes, DC Comics, and flicks with a Latine lead and themes about family. I went into watching this film knowing nothing about Blue Beetle himself, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.",8

However, the movie i went to see had technical difficulties showing and mgmt gave us the opportunity to see something else. We chose Blue Beetle simply because it was about to start on another screen.<br><br>I had low expectations for this movie. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it. It is lighthearted at times, has some family values built in (similar to Spiderman), and there was enough action to satisfy an action fan, but not so much to bore someone who's not into too much action. Yes, the story line is not the most original. But that didn't bother me. The fact that the superhero was not your typical superhero, and his family was not the typical superhero family, made it different. If you go to see it just enjoy it as a stand alone movie and don't compare it to other superhero movies. I had not expectations and i was pleasantly surprised.<br><br>(There were one or two things about the movie which disappointed me, one being when he should have used his full powers and decided to jerk around and hold back, but other the that, I had no problem with the movie, even with a couple of corny jokes, which can be seen as something this family might actually say in real life anyway.)",7

But the DCEU tried that and people didn't like that either.<br><br>The biggest issues with this in terms of numbers is it was put in cinemas during a writer strike smack bang between a universe ending and a universe that has not really started.<br><br>Most general audience would be fine with it overall but wont go as they have no idea who Blue Beetle is (and unfortunately the concept of this hero, and the humour in ads, screams another Ryan Reynolds GL vibe).<br><br>MCU superfans wont watch it because its DC.<br><br>DCEU superfans wont watch it because its not Snyderverse (get over it already).<br><br>Really hoping the overall reviews are ok regardless of money as BB deserves some recognition.

" A travesty compared to the comics origins.
","The director and writers have no grasp of Jaime Reyes' character. Jaime Reyes, in my opinion, is the best new character introduced in the last 20 years in comics. His character's deepest desire (extracted by supernatural means) was to be a dentist to provide for his family. Why on earth did they cut out that wholesome part of his characterization? Yes. Lawyers, occasionally help people. Sometimes even for charity, but let's be honest - that is not a profession people go into for altruism by and large. I cracked up that he went to Gotham University for law school as well. The only thing I can envision lawyers from that city doing regularly is filing papers to keep (likely guilty) clients out of prison or dodging acid attacks in the courtroom. Was there an aside that he got a prelaw class with a guest lecture by Dent? Why not have Jaime go to Ivy college? Why would a family struggling send a kid out of state for a higher education? That does not make sense to me. Even with scholarships - unless it is a full ride - that is a big step for families without extensive resources.<br><br>This may have been a film about Blue Beetle, but this is not Jaime Reyes. Cutting out his supporting cast, Paco and Brenda was not necessary. I wish we had gotten to see actual kid sister Milagros. I liked the actress, but I wish she had been depicted younger.<br><br>I like the new character of Jenny Kord even if I feel they didn't give her agency. The actress is good but they built no background for establishing this character. A few short minutes establishing the character with her father as a child and this would have been an incredibly improved film. I also like the actor for Blue Beetle, even if I disliked this film. I like him in Cobra Kai as well. But this is going to be a hot take, he's too cocky as Jaime for this to be the first outing with the Scarab. He did not fit the comics I've read - and I've followed this character since the debut. I think he would have been a better fit as Rafael Sandoval (El Diablo).<br><br>The villains are caricatures. Their actions without consequence tearing up a city are hysterically ill-plotted. The plot itself is nonsensical, and looking at the rich but recent comic history to pull from this is just a mess. I wish I could say I was surprised it was butchered so badly, but recent comic book movies have been awful across the board. I would rate lower, but I love this character so much and I do like the actors. I did like hearing the scarab speak and think the CGI is good. Here's hoping DC get's it's soul back in future cinematic endeavors.",5
" I Needed this Movie
","The premise is simple, Victoria Kord is a power-hungry company leader trying to get the alien scarab that has attached itself to Jaime Reyes by any means necessary. The cast was all-around fine, with George Lopez being the absolute stand-out and Xolo Mariduena doing a great job as Jaime. Fun and exciting tone with emotion sprinkled in. Jaime and his family were the heart of this movie, it felt genuine and how a Hispanic family would act. The antagonists were not great, they were definitely one-note, Victoria Kord was mainly just a typical greedy corporate head while Carapax was the typical henchmen character. The visuals were decent, but towards the later half of the movie weren't great, but keep in mind this was originally going straight to HBO Max. The Blue Beetle suit however was masterfully done. The comedy was solid, there is a little bit of childish humor, but the rest of it mostly sticks. The action is pretty entertaining and suspenseful at times. If you're on the fence about watching this movie, you should go see it, everybody who worked on it, clearly put their heart and soul into it. After a long week of stress, this movie really made me have a fun time. I was scared that this movie was going to be bad, but thankfully it wasn't. I hope this movie can be what Spy Kids was to me for young Hispanics. All in all, this movie was a blast and a glimmer in the dying genre of the superhero movie.",8
" Very poor DC movie trying to be comical but failing
","Gave up after an hour, just couldn't do anymore. Activate bug fart was the final straw. Stuck with it for as long as I could. Storyline not too bad to start but very child like, corny, so many 'so how did he know how to do that' questions. The editors did a pretty poor job too. Bloke gets his ID pinched to get into a high security room, next scene he's back in the room without his ID????<br><br>Don't think they knew what audience they were aiming for. Very children cheesy in some parts but in others aiming for an adult audience.<br><br>Trying to be Spider-Man, Venom, Iron Man with the marvel comedy aspect but failing miserably.",4
" Goated 🐐🐐
","Wow. Magnificent. Being a huge fan of the Snyderverse it was a tough pill to swallow when that discontinued, but this movie totally gives the DCU a New Fresh Start. Its a mixture of The Dark DCEU and humour but the end product is excellent. DC is now maintaining family, humour and darkness very well. Matt Reeves universe is the darkest but movies like Blue Beetle Maintain the Balance. Xolo Mariduena is top notch along with George Lopez. From the costumes to the cinematography to the VFX to the characters to the dialogues - 100/100. The film truly proves that Family is really the best strength for anybody.",10
" Meh. A forgettable film.
",Lets start off with the positives. The special effects were really well done. The color grading was fun. There were a couple scenes that actually got a chuckle out of me.<br><br>But the film's story was just absurd. You're telling me that a group of poor immigrants know how to fly Alien ships and use advanced weaponry? On their first attempt of using it? That was so ridiculous. Not even Hollywood's magic could convince a viewer of that.<br><br>The story felt like it was going on and on. You know when you're watching a good movie and time doesn't matter? You're lost in the story. Well mediocre films you'll constantly look at your watch to see when the misery will end. First time I glanced at my watch was almost exactly one hour into the film. The movie is over 2 hrs long. It was tough getting through another hour of the story.<br><br>I can't say I'd ever want to watch it again.,5
" The Best Live-Action DC Movie In A While
","The DCEU has had its ups and downs since its conception and a lot have lost faith in the direction of its universe. Blue Beetle is a breath of fresh air and could be a promising beginning for its new path. The story is simple but it is enhanced greatly by the performances of the cast. I never doubted the love this family has for one another. The action is fun and the humor feel less formulaic than others of the genre that I feel is both an effort of the writers and the cast themselves. Blue Beetle is one of the best superhero movies this year. If you've grown weary of the universe, this might reinvigorate your interest.",8
" Unambitious, but Very Fun (and NOT a Multiverse film)
","Don't take that as an insult, that's really just the best word I can find to describe the film. Unambitious. But honestly, it's kind of refreshing after so many overdesigned, overpacked multiverse films that have been made lately. It's a bit like stepping into a warm bath that you can just relax in. One thing I can say off the bat is that the trailer does an extremely good job of setting expectations for the film itself. If you saw the trailer and thought: ""that looks pretty fun"", you will probably exit the cinema thinking: ""that was pretty fun"".<br><br>In terms of pros and cons, for me at least, the jokes were mostly unoriginal, but still funny, very funny at times, the action was fairly typical, but well lit and still very cool to watch. Speaking of lighting, the film looks great. Costumes, sets, cinematography, lighting, all good. It's less washed out than older DC films like Batman V Superman, but less saturated than more extreme Marvel films like Thor: Ragnarok. It looks very real, with just enough extra color to make it pop satisfyingly.<br><br>The plot was predictable, but at least they chose a good plot, and the cast was very endearing, I couldn't help but get invested in their over-the-top family antics. Xolo Mariduena is a revelation as Jaime Rayes, able to sell the part of the young hero without overdoing it on the ""young"" aspect, something that can plague other superhero films with young protagonists *coughs* Shazam 2* coughs*. There is a good balance being stuck between Jaime's reluctance at being unceremoniously saddled with the irreversible power of an alien superweapon, and his natural excitement that any of us would have to acknowledge at being able to fly and catch rockets.<br><br>Big plus for me; the villain is actually a villain. She isn't very sympathetic, and although the implied bias against the latino characters is a little on the nose, the film does a good job of showing that she is pretty despicable in all aspects of her villainy. Proper evil antagonists will always be more fun for me.<br><br>All things considered, I would recommend giving this a shot. It's campy, yes, but it is full of the hearts and souls of the people who made it, and I'd rather watch a movie that sets and hits a fairly low bar, than a film that feels like it was made on an assembly line.<br><br>And, if nothing else, just savor that this film takes place in one place, in one time, with one version of the character.",7
" Entertaining and Enjoyable
","I watched Blue Beetle today and thoroughly enjoyed it. The film had heart, action, drama and comedy. The special effects were very good. The main character of Jaime Reyes was portrayed beautifully by Xolo Maridueña, I hope he stays on in the new DCU. The family dynamics were well done and you believed that they were really family that truly care and love each other. The action scenes were very dynamic and did a good job keeping me entertained.<br><br>The villains were pretty generic and forgettable, which is a shame as one of them was played by Susan Sarandon.<br><br>Now, where the film looses a point from me is the constant left wing politics which seem to mire much of today's so called entertainment.<br><br>Overall, a highly entertaining and enjoyable film which I would definitely rewatch.",9
" Best DCU film of the year!
","Blue beetle was amazing
I would rate it either 7 or 8 out of 10 the cgi of blue beetle alone was amazing the transformation felt scary looking but exciting to watch each time.<br><br>Some characters feel at start annoying but as the story moves on you will love these characters.<br><br>The villains weren't great but they don't bore you out carapax had a good story and background that I loved the other one the kord one was more boring.<br><br>The Reyes family where amazing they felt like a genuine family like you wouldn't see in a film but in real life
I also think this film done so good because it wasn't hyped up as much as the other films like the Flash it was so hyped up we expected so much but was let down with blue beetle we weren't as hyped we didn't expect much of it so it done a lot better.",10
" A decent and emotional movie.7,50/10
","Well, let's start with the intro, which was rather weak, it didn't really impress me at all, but easily, certain phases easily stopped me, and with that I can say that I liked it, yes, it's not the best movie, but not the weakest either. The acting was excellent, speaking of Xolo Mariduena, this boy was made for this role, otherwise I haven't seen an acting that surprised me enough. The script was ok, I can say if that's the term because it had many lapses but it was also good in certain scenes and dialogues. What made me give such a pompous note to this film is the soundtrack and the cinematography. Honestly it's the kind of movie that deserves to be seen at least once.",8
" Behind the Blue Mask: The Rebirth of DC Movies ?
","Blue Beetle is a fun, heartfelt superhero film that is refreshingly family-focused, all thanks to Xolo Mariduea's compelling performance as the lead character. Given that the family played a larger role in it once again, the tone of the film is similar to that of ""Shazam!"" despite the fact that the tale is not particularly compelling. Not that ""Shazam!"" had some epic tale, but I believe it had a greater concept. The cast is adequate, but there are times when they veer too far into melodrama. From the beginning, through his purpose, the fights, and the conclusion, the villain is all you would expect from a D-grade super hero film. There have been enough discussions about this character's future to satisfy everyone: will there be a sequel? Will the character move to the newly created universe? Is he or she a part of the DC Extended Universe or the DC Comics Universe? In my opinion, there won't be a sequel because of the new change of direction James Gunn is going to take in the DC universe, just as the Flash movie won't have a sequel i presume. Additionally, I'm not sure how a blank slate can be achieved without the baggage of the prior universe when you always toward the past rather than the future. In other words, there is always a chance to see Blue Beetle again, but I'm not sure who will play it or whether or not the genesis narrative will be exactly the same this time. I also won't be holding my breath for it. In conclusion, the film is ""okay"" It has its moments, but nothing particularly remarkable or memorable can be said. The two credit scenes are, I suppose, acceptable.",6
" Just watched blue beetle
","What a interesting movie I still can't tell if I like it or not. Starting of with blue beetle himself I didn't think anything was bad about him but I didn't think anything was great either, the cgi was fine nothing really wrong with it. The villain who I can't really remember was bad I didn't really care about his backstory or even his relationship with the other villain who was bad as well. The best thing about the film is the dynamic between the family, I found myself really liking the characters and was a bit emotional when the dad died. Finally the action is pretty good all of the fight scenes when he is taking down henchmen was satisfying to watch.",6
" Suit Reminds me of Star Kid
","After being the first to graduate from college in his family, Jaime and the rest of Reyes are entering a turbulent time in their lives. They have lost their business, his father has health issues, and they are about to be evicted from their home. Jaime hopes to save his family, and his hopes are fueled by a chance encounter with Jenny Kord, a member of Kord Industries. Instead of giving Jaime a job, she entrusts him with the Scarab. Unknown to Jaime and Jenny, the Scarab chooses Jaime as the next host, and Jaime is forced to become the next Blue Beetle, and chaos ensues.<br><br>This is the first movie in the DCU with James Gunn at the helm. This movie can go either way. The story gives viewers enough information about the Blue Beetle but is not an origin story. There are no significant connections to the overall DCU. Still, there are some easter eggs and references made throughout the film. Fans of the Blue Beetle comics may feel differently about the film. Overall, the movie is worth a watch and could lead to something more significant in the overall DCU; only time will tell.",7
" Amazing movie, give it a watch!
","This movie might single handily be the best recent DC film! The actors chosen were great, with how the movie was put together was also amazing! Yes some scenes in the movie were bad looking but all movies have that at least this movie makes you feel like you are actually experiencing a actual superhero in the making. Choosing Blue Beetle to make a movie about was a amazing idea and connects with many people around the world who loves the underdogs!

" A pacifist in deadly armor
","A pleasant surprise of a summer movie. The plot and its characters are endearing, the Reyes family is relatable and offers more than just support: but their own emotional contribution and strong connection. Because Uncle Rudy (played by the great George Lopez) takes Jaime and Jenny under his wing and explains how he was a fan of the 2nd Blue Beetle, lending a legacy and world building in the writing.<br><br>Because Jaime is prominent as a character and not relying on his suit to make him likable, we see he is a pacifist and humble in deadly armor that creates situational comedy. We hear the suit Khaji-da tell him things that only him and the audience know unbeknownst to the family and others such as near the end about his ""mid region"" ahem. I'm personally glad he's not another attitude-filled snarky main character. Minus a point for playing off the Scarab's voice as robotic.",9
" Disappointed
",Wow let me tell you this is definitely not a superhero movie sorry but this has to be a comedy. The acting is ok I wouldn't say great. The quality is good. I laughed a few times but other that I was really disappointed. There was no real work put into this movie it was like ok let's throw a movie together real quick. This movie was just a quick buck I honestly think they missed a great opportunity with this movie. I really wouldn't waste my time it just a let down. The blue beetles costume is pretty cool. The other suit looks like an iron man knock off. This was truly sad it would do better as a comedy.,2
" A Missed Opportunity- Same Old Hollywood Formula
","Gone are the days where you can simply rely on CGI to get a film over the line.<br><br>With the seemingly endless churning of super hero movies from Marvel or the DC universe, this is sadly another film that suffers from an uninspiring and predictable script that is a carbon copy of so many others before.<br><br>Combine this with annoying characters, poor goofy jokes and the same formula that has been used for over a decade for these types of movies, you have something that will be sadly (and easily) forgotten about as soon as the marketing and hype dies down.<br><br>While it is perhaps worth watching once on a rainy day, as this is one of the less commonly known super heroes, the story leaves much to be desired. Hopefully if they do another one, things will pick up!",3
" PEOPLE WILL HATE THIS MOVIE FOR THEIR LIFE
","This movie was sooo good. The characters and the family was amazing and felt like a real family, the action was so badass, and the soundtrack fit so perfect with the movie it was so amazing. Another thing I loved was the blue and purple light that showed up most of the movie it made it feel like a 80's sythwave vibe. I honestly loved this movie, yea the villian was kinda predictable and coulda been better but that doesnt take away from how good this movie was. James gunn is gonna save dc.

","I had no intent of seeing this movie in theater but my partner is a big DC fan so why not. I was thoroughly shocked with how good this movie was. I don't understand the hate it gets. It definitely was more of the lighter super hero movies we've had between DC and MARVEL recently but that's not necessarily a bad thing at all. The acting was phenomenal from all the cast with some of the least known being able to keep up with more well known. I'm never one for corny messages in movies but the one in this about having a strong family unit was touching especially during the climax when the family needed to come together even closer.

" The sister, Milagro Reyes, need to be captured!
","I am not going to write the review about the movie that 278 people have already done it. This review is more about the character of Sister, Milagro Reyes, played by Belissa Escobedo. And what can we learn from this character?<br><br>Her character puts everyone in danger. Towards the end of the review you shall be able to connect why we need to shut down this type of character right in the beginning.<br><br>After Jenny hands over the burger box to Jaime she says two things;
a.) Guard this with your life
b.) Do not open this box<br><br>Jaime heeded the instructions well and gets it to home. He even shares the details with his family so that they are aware and in any case there is an emergency due to that, they are well prepared. But here comes the sister - Milagro who right from the beginning has been shown as a rebellious individual who thinks that she knows the world better than anybody. Trying to be over-smart and brash but zero-contributor in the family. When Jaime clearly said that a. And b. Have to be followed Milagro pushed him to open the box. She also got entire family to push him. The turning point was when she picked up the beetle in her hand and started to tease Jaime while he was trying to put everything in order.<br><br>Now let's connect the events in the movie because of this one ignorant and immature person;<br><br>0. Jaime got fired from the job.<br><br>1. Jaime got transformed in to Beetle with a symbiote in his body. One may say he got super powers but he lost his original form of the body.<br><br>2. His family house got partially destroyed right in the beginning when he flew out. They had to sell everything just to survive now more damages.<br><br>3. Victoria Kord and her Team became enemy of the entire family. If the Beetle was not activated or Milagro was not playing with it perhaps the enemy would have been within The Kord Family and not outside in the world.<br><br>4. His family was captured, the house was burnt down and his father passed away due to heart attack.<br><br>5. While Jenny and Milagro are running in the tunnels one of the tunnels collapsed and Jenny could have been killed.<br><br>At no point she realises that all this happened because of her. She was either near or in all the accidents that have happened in the movie including Jaime losing his job.<br><br>This movie makes us realise that there could be one such person in the family, amongst the friends or work who could possibly put another person in danger. Such character(s) could be skittish at any moment, that is when one has to keep both his/her eyes open and stop the immaturity.<br><br>I loved the movie, its story, portrayal of the protagonist, visuals and actions...but when I connect the dots I wanted to put Milagro Reyes in jail.",8

" Ok-ish superhero movie
","Blue Beetle is an ok-ish superhero movie. Neither too bad but neither good either. You'll either love it or hate it. At least according the the reviews here on IMDB.<br><br>Me personally? I think it's ok, like I said in the beginning. Thing is that it really tries to be or rather borrow from way too many movies: Sky Kids (?), Deadpool (actually I feel like Deadpool had better jokes), Power Rangers (with the whole transformation sequence), generic family movie.<br><br>Just like other reviewes said, the main character doesn't actually control the plot. Things just happens to him and he goes along with them. This might be an unpopular opinion but the family scenes are just too much and too many. So much that the movie feels like is more about his family rather than him. From what I know, the title of the movie is ""Blue Beetle"" not ""Blue Beetle's Family"". Nothing bad in portraying a strong family bond but this is over the top. Obnoxious uncle who just should be the supporting character not try to take over the role of the main character. I like his energy, he's the conspirationist of the family, anti-goverment and such. Still, doesn't make him less obnoxious.<br><br>Very ambiguous love relationship. You really can't tell if the BB's love interest is into him or not. Are they actually lovers? Is he friendzoned? I mean he clearly is into her but is she into him as well?!? Besides the kiss at the end (I think?!?) the movie doesn't let us know these things or reveal much.<br><br>I also wanted more action scenes than just 2-3 in the whole movie.<br><br>I rate it 6/10.",6
" Harshly Underrated: A good watch
","In my opinion, this movie is being underrated. I'm not saying it's perfect, but compared to some other recent projects by DC, I thought it was good. The acting is good, the effects were decent and the action is fine. That being said, the movie still has one or two of the normal cliches of a super hero movie. But for the one or two flies that the movie seems to have, the rest of it does make up for it the best it can. When it comes to terms of comic accuracy, most of it is fairly accurate. There are a couple exceptions like there's no mention of the Reach anywhere and the scarab is a little too friendly compared to other versions but for the movie they were trying to make, it works pretty well. And the post credit scene sets up a sequel so what's missing here could be solved later. Overall this is good movie and I would recommend it despite what some other users are saying.",8
" This was a lot of fun!
","People are going into this expecting some kind of revolutionary experience. I really don't know why. It's a super hero movie. At this point, the genre is pretty well known.

Nothing more, nothing less. Anyway. I had a blast! I was laughing the entire time. Did not expect it to be as funny as it was. The action was great, the characters were fun, and it has heart.<br><br>I would recommend this 100%, especially if you like George Lopez.

" Predictable and some lame jokes
","Well, what a start off of movie with a joke. Some stranger old man swiping on tinder dates while telling the (Jaime) main character look like he's 6 figures in debt after he asked how he look when he wore his graduation hat. My first thought is they are definitely gonna put in a lot of lame jokes and comedy into it.<br><br>When Jaime want to kiss the girl, well as you guessed it, someone's got to interrupt and stop the kiss, that also kind of annoyed me, why every movie got to do that cliche interruption? Rather not have any of that.<br><br>Also when they say it looks like the Blue Beetle is trying to protect it's host at one part, so a part when Jaime tried to fly, it didn't activate the suit and fly, my first thought was he could just jump off the building and the beetle would activate itself. He then thought about the beetle would protect him part they told him and did what I expected to, jump off the building. It's so predictable.<br><br>Also the whole family can fly an unknown spaceship like an experience space pilot, they know what buttons it can do. Grandma use a handheld disco gattling gun of course for some comedy aspect. Like some badass grandma. OK I would give that to them, It kinda suits her.<br><br>There is also this Mexican scientist that work at the lab with the antagonist who then risked his life saving Jaime. Jaime didn't even know him at all and he seems timid to be doing that. I'm sure they just do that just because he's Mexican and so are Jaime. Way too corny man.<br><br>I am only just watching for the CGI, the rest are just meh.",6

From an early age, I became obsessed with batman and teen titans --by the time I could read, I was immersed in the comic book universe of D. C.

C would always be ahead of marvel in my eyes, for the place it held in my heart.<br><br>In 2008, the Dark Knight became a cinematic masterpiece, somehow making it to the top 5 on the IMDB top 250 while raking in several Oscar nominations. While 2008 marked the peak of D. C., I immensely believe this movie marks the end in 2023. There is no coming back from a movie this horrendous.<br><br>I guess I will begin with the comedic aspect of this movie, since it constantly makes attempts to be funny even in its darker moments. George Lopez is often the source of this movies comic relief, as he is often used throughout the movie to rake in cheap laughs from the audience.<br><br>I'm not sure if there are any stand up comedy fans reading this review, but the jokes are very similar to Brendan Schaub's comedy special, The Gringo Papi. Lots of physical, awkward comedy that doesn't hit, along with cheap, corny jokes about the Latin American culture.<br><br>The acting was just awful. The main character, who I had not seen in any major motion picture prior despite being a big movie buff, was just okay. He did not steal the show nor did he prove to be a strong lead. His acting wasn't terrible and he did prove to have some chemistry with the movies main love interest, which felt real at times, but who wouldn't in his situation.<br><br>George Lopez was over the top per usual, but was easily the best actor in the film alongside Susan Sarandon, who did well as the movies antagonist.<br><br>The worst actress of the film was the young woman who played the sister of Jamie Reyes. How she managed to land a role of this caliber is a testament to the bad casting of D. C, something they can learn a thing or two from Marvel. Her acting was so over the top and elementary, it reminded you that you were watching a movie even during intense scenes that should have the audience immersed in the magic of film.<br><br>Overall, the acting was very bad. 3/10 at most. The acting was a huge downgrade from The Flash movie that came out just a month prior. While Ezra Miller has his controversies outside the big screen, him and Michael Keaton are academy level actors that stole the show. The acting in this movie, in contrast, was elementary, dull, and over the top.<br><br>The special effects were terrible. 1/10 to put a rating on it. I honestly wonder how they managed to pull off this poor of CGI with this large of a budget.<br><br>Originality was easily a 0/10. This is the worst superhero movie of all time in this category. Absolutely nothing about this movie is original besides the Latin aspect. This movie is literally a much worse version of iron man combined with venom. I'm sure I don't even have to go into detail to prove this point.<br><br>Plot was a 2/10. I have no idea how I stayed awake for this nonsense. The writers for the DCU need to go back to the drawing board and really figure out how they will not allow this to happen again. I hate to keep comparing this to The Flash movie, but that plot was at least somewhat interesting.<br><br>1/10 for the script. Dialogue was....well, some things are better left unsaid. Whoever wrote this script was likely 16. Otherwise, I have no clue how the people who wrote this script can drive cars and perform other day-to-day functions that regular adults perform.<br><br>Lastly, I will end this review on a more positive note. The movie did pass one category in my book, which is the romance between the lead actor and actress. They seemingly had good chemistry on screen that felt real to the audience. Throughout the movie, you find yourself rooting for the main character to get the girl. Even though their relationship was very corny, it was one of the few aspects of this movie that wasn't mediocre. After all, romances in films are often a bit corny.<br><br>The family also had chemistry, as it felt like a real family. The relationships between on screen-characters were good. As the audience, you can tell this is a cast that likely gets along well off-screen.<br><br>Moreover, The chemistry between characters gets a solid 5/10 in my book which is still a failing grade, but brings this movie to about a 2/10 instead of a 0 which is what I would have given it otherwise.<br><br>Throughout the review, I made mention of many other superhero movies and often drew comparisons to other superhero movie universes. One thing I would like to make clear, is that putting superhero movies aside, this is one of the worst MOVIES period, I have ever seen. MOVIES... Not just superhero movies.",2
" Deserved to be a massive hit.
","It is sad to know that Blue Beetle won't have a sequel in a series of DC movies. This is a film with heart, humour, humility and humanity. The usual action sequences are all there, and they are beautifully realised, but it is the performances of all concerned that elevate this film to a very high level within the superhero genre. Xolo Mariduena is perfectly cast in the lead role, displaying all of the aforementioned qualities of the movie as a whole. It is giving nothing away in saying that the final action sequence is not the ""usual"" set piece of seemingly never-ending bombast that can detract from the overall rating of what may have preceded it, because Blue Beetle is ultimately about human connections, kindness and the importance of family. To my mind, Blue Beetle is up there with the original Wonder Woman movie and Man of Steel in the DC universe which has, sadly, not had the careful curation of the Marvel universe. Blue Beetle deserved a sequel and a series but will sadly receive neither because of the misguided curation of DC's ouevre. The film did not fail in itself because it is excellent. It was failed by the disjointed narrative and the lack of a common story line or thread to link the DC universe cohesively.",9
" What a pleasant surprise!
","I went into Blue Beetle with zero expectations whatsoever and, boy, did it surprise me! The critics and audience consensus say that it's an okay film, good at best. 6.3 on IMDB, 3.1 on Letterboxd, B+ on Cinemascore, 78% on Rotten Tomatoes and 61 on Metacritic. All of this is to say that I liked the movie more than most. Sure, it has it's flaws: most notably the formulaic script. Superhero fatigue is all too real, and if superheroes aren't your jam, you probably won't like this movie.<br><br>As a fan of comic book movies, especially the soon-to-be deceased DCEU, the last few entries have been underwhelming, to say the least. Apart from The Batman, most entries have been lacking: Black Adam, Shazam: Fury of the Gods!, The Flash. I'm glad to report that Blue Beetle delivers - at least to an extent. Sure, the plot is generic, but the movie has heart, especially when it's focusing on the Reyes family. It may be predictable, but it's fun, funny and even emotional, at times. The score, cinematography and direction are all worthy of praise too. As is Xolo Maridueña and Bruna Marquezine's chemistry. George Lopez also delivers, as usual.<br><br>Suffice to say, while it doesn't reinvent the wheel, Blue Beetle delivers a great film - one filled with fun and heart. It's surely better than the other entries DC have put out this year: Shazam and Flash, though no where near the masterpiece that was The Batman.",8
" Bad Marvel humor followed by Transformers action
","Had I not gone with a group of friends and coworkers, I definitely would have walked out of this one. Tonally, it's a children's movie. There are no stakes; the action-leavening 'humor' is MUCH worse than the low bar already set by Marvel movies, the action is meh, the plot is the most predictable of any big-tent action movie I've seen in a while, Susan Sarandon's (the main villain) character/performance is probably the worst of her career ... I struggle to think of a single positive aspect of this film. Usually I'll see a bad movie and be able to say that at least the acting was good, not so here. Even seeing the high-budget production in IMAX couldn't save it.",2
" Overacting and Bad Scripting
","Supposed to jumpstart the whole new DC Universe but failed. Who ever wrote the scripts had too much cheesy lines and bad delivery. It's like you are watching highschool musical/80s sitcom/telenovela all mixed together in a bad way. Too much slapstick lines and acting made it very bad. I hope they will improve on the writing and learn on the mistakes done by Black Adam, Wonder Woman Woman 1984, Suicide Squad, The Flash. Please lessen the bad lines. Make it darker like before, don't waste great actors and actresses just because of bad scripting and story lines. The superhero fatigue is getting there but all are hoping that future DC movies would change all of that.",6

Anything below 5/10 is not right.<br><br>The acting is alright, the comedy is alright. What does everyone expect of superhero movies these days?

" The Better Spectrum of What DC Can Be
","Blue Beetle ""a family oriented thriller with lots of dynamic characters, hilarious moments and true Latino culture"" is how this movie was pitched. But this synopsis alone doesn't give this heartfelt movie enough credit. Not only does this film show the importance of optimism in DC movies it also shows the inevitability of loss. Jaime as a second gen immigrant must be the cross barer of the family and holds the internal pressure of leading his family out of poverty through academic means. This is common in various minority housholds and is hard enough let alone the pressure of being a rising superhero. The parallels between the stakes of being a first college attendee in your family and being a superhero were perfectly intertwined and demonstrated how both roles have to perform for the benefit of their supporters under extreme conditions and outside pressure. It's a wonderful theme that I believe Xolo Maridueña (Jaime Reyes) and the rest of the cast understood to a T.",10
" One of the best DCU movies besides Flash, Shazam, and Batman
","I love the concept of the character and the themes incorporated in the film. This character kind of make me think of Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Venom because the scarab is like the symbiote of the DC universe, Jaime Reyes is like Peter Parker before he gets his powers, the villains are like Tony Stark/Iron Man's wanting to continue to make weapons for the greater good for the future. I love the cast picked for each character for the movie. I hope we get see more Jaime Reyes and other versions of Blue Beetle in the DC universe. Hope we see more of the mythology of the Blue Beetle. Hope we see more of the first and second Blue Beetle in future films.",9
" A good DC film
","Well, this movie isn't the best of course, but it is a good one for my perspective. I always see superhero movies since my childhood and personally, I prefer Marvel movies in general. There was some very good DC movies indeed, but not since a lot of time. I liked a lot Batman movies with Christian Bale, Suicid Squads I and II and Joker for example. Shazam 2 was okay, but I preferred the first one (storyline and humour). Blue Beetle has the same kind of humour of Shazam 1, which I liked. The suit looks great, the fight scenes in general are nice, but the storyline was a bit ""cliché"". I very liked the fact that the character and the actor seems close to the comics. I very appreciated that the story was latino-like because this help us to see others things in the cinema industry than always americans one. They done great compared to the recent Transformers : Rise of the beasts in that way.",7

" A superhero movie with heart
","Right off the bat I will say this was a movie with a heart and that's what I was able to take back with me after watching it. The heart comes from the love of family and boy, do we need more of that in the world today, more than ever!<br><br>The overall feel of the movie was pretty good and the story had a flow that kept me watching through the whole film. The most irritating part about this movie was the hero being such a good guy that he refuses to use his newfound power even when his own family is in danger. That was way too unrealistic and puke inducing. I can understand if some viewers might feel turned off by excessive sweetness in an action movie! However, his final treatment of the supervillain was the part that made me see the heart in this story.<br><br>Don't listen too much to the detractors and give this movie a watch, there's a snippet of information in the credits worth checking out.",7
" Blue Beetle
","A fantastic, marvelous, emotional and really funny movie. A new DC Universe Character introduced to theaters by Angel Manuel Soto did a great direction to this film. The cast was literally perfect. The action scenes were great. The suit really looks perfect. A family and superhero entertainment movie. Man of Steel reference just lands fine. The VFX and CGI were great. There is no dull moment from starting to end everything really just works fine. The villian Conrad Carapax action scenes were great. A huge family emotional. Kudos to all the crew members of #BlueBeetle. Really looking forward to the sequel.",10
" Decent Superhero flick that suffers from audience fatigue.
","While there's nothing inherently wrong with this in isolation, this is a by the numbers Superhero origin movie. It's safe, doesn't challenge it's audience, and does not exceed expectations.<br><br>We get the evil mega-corp, we get the moustache twirling (or hair curling?) villain, and a boss battle at the end that is complete with OTT CGI.<br><br>But where this movie does shine is in the protagonists family. A warm, fun, engaging group who are there for him.<br><br>The actual superhero antics are very much what we've seen before, and effects laden OTT hitting and swooshing with CGI in abundance.<br><br>It has potential to be a decent enough franchise, but sadly it has hit just as super hero fatigue is at it's peak. Marvel and DC have saturated the screens both small and large with a bajillion superheroes over the last 20 years and wrung out all but passing interest in them, so for a new one to succeed it needs something truly original and new. This wasn't it, but it was entertaining and hit all the right notes nonetheless.<br><br>I doubt the hinted at sequel will ever come to pass, especially after the recent changes at the top of DCs cinematic output.",8

Xolo did a spectacular performance (as always). The family was so loving and realistic oh my god. When that scene came on when Kord was hunting them down in their house I swear I cried. Like full on tears. You can't help but root for them every single time. Every person who helped make this movie a reality deserves everythinggg. I was sobbing, laughing, everything. And when that guy with the red suit had the epiphany at the end, I can't lie that made my heart hurt. It was so beautiful, the entire movie. The message that a loving family makes you stronger always gets me everytime. This movie deserves everything.",10
" Blue Beetle is the fresh new take and boost!
","I just watched blue beetle last night, What a great storytelling and genuine performance from the cast. I couldn't imagine anyone else portraying these characters. The direction and vision from Angel Manuel Sotos really brought the story of Blue Beetle to life and made it known worldwide especially to the Latino community. As a Latino(boricua) superhero movie fan and actor I've always felt that we were missing out on playing a superhero on the big screen. And Xolo and the whole cast really showed and represented that ""sason Goya""(seasoning) and our beautiful Latin heritage. Numbers are looking great and I think Blue Beetle was a fresh new take and boost the genre needed. I think picking Xolo Mariduena was a genius idea by the team and in my book he brought us the perfect Jaime Reyes! Congratulations to the whole team, job amazingly and talently done. Looking forward to play the villain in Blue Beetle 2 🤣 Lmao, no but seriously I hope to see the great news of getting green lip for chapter 2! #vamoarribalatinos.",10

Great to see at the theater to experience all the action. I hope they have a sequel, yes, it was that good to me. I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect and it exceeded my expectations for sure. Bottom line: Family friendly, fun, full of heart, good message, go see it!",9
" Doesn't have enough things to be good :(
","1. Some months before release: 'Nah, it looks too mediocre, I don't even know who this Blue Beetle is. Okay, at least he has a sword from Final Fantasy!'
2. Some days before release: ""Wow, what is it? Good rating? Now I'm hooked!""
3. Some minutes after leaving the cinema: ""Ooohhhh........""<br><br>In a few words, I didn't like it. Blue Beetle looks like a superhero origin combined with Iron Man, Venom, and Spider-Man, adding just a bit of the family dynamic from Encanto (or Fast &amp; Furious, you decide).<br><br>The only outstanding thing is the cringe factor: strange jokes, graphics that are far from the best, and a derivative plot - everything looks like it was made in the 00s. It's not bad, really; sometimes, it's even good - you'll definitely giggle if you're into this style. However, it's not enough to label the movie as a good one.<br><br>P. S. While watching this one, I've finally come up with the thought that I'm always bored during the first act. All these character introductions and exposition setups look like they're for people who are watching the first movie in their life. It doesn't matter if I like the film; I'm always waiting for the real action to begin 🙁",5
" A fun and charming family DC film.
","I wasn't expecting much of Blue Beetle. DC hasn't been the best lately and this studio needed a win to get back on track. This was that win. It isn't groundbreaking, super memorable, or the best comic book movie of all time, but it isn't trying to be that. It's trying to be a fun and charming origin story with family as the core of the movie. As a Latino I loved all the references to our culture and I was constantly laughing out loud at the jokes and references the grandma made because I could relate to them. Are the villains weak? Yes. Is the plot generic? Yes. But at the end of the day, Xolo Maridueña anchors this movie with a great performance and makes this a pleasant surprise of a movie.<br><br>PD: Shoutout to George Lopez for being such a standout.",7

","Just finished watching this, Nothing in this movie is bad they just didn't make it good enough, Let me make it clear. This is an induction movie of a new superhero, it's the same like others film, doesn't have too much good sense just letting us know that a new hero is coming to kick those asses. The Cinematographer did good, very beautiful even though we already seen that place in others movie already. The Action, Storyline &amp; Characters are also good, Carapx is not actually a bad guy, we knew that though his eyes even we didn't know his flashback yet, the fighting scenes are interesting, fighting styles with effects make it become one of the best fight scenes, the storyline is not bad tho, but like I said, they just didn't make it good enough for the audience, there are so many superhero movies that come out with how they got superpower and how they learn to control it like it become nothing new because the audience already what's going on with the same taste of introduce superhero movies. Let's talk about the VFX, This time the CGI is way better than before, we can see that the effects combo with the fight make us enjoy it so good, but there's so much funny scenes that makes some of it didn't make so well, like it become cringe or smt.

I enjoyed a bit the CGI, but hated when the differences between the action scenes and static scenes showed two different ways to display the suit (CGI and the tissue one). I found a lot the lack of ideas in the plot (in my opinion too much ideas have been stolen from spiderman homecoming) the recurrence of *happy family - superpowers - family in danger - revenge - compassion for the bad guy - happy ending* made this film very banal and similar to others.",5
" Decent
","I went into the movie expecting a fun comic book movie but nothing special and that's basically what it was. While there where some scenes where the acting wasn't particularly good, the preformeces where fine. It has a pretty generic villain but most superhero movies do so it doesn't really bother me. The fan service is done very well in this movie as the amount of references isn't too much. For example it was fun to say Dan Garret get mentioned as he rarely does in anything and showing some of Ted kord's gadgets from the comics was fun. There is two ways of looking at the end credits. If the movie is set in the new dcu then it's an exciting ending and does a good job setting up a sequel whether that will happen or not. Or looking at it as a dceu movie where the ending is a big load of nothing. Overall its not one of the great superhero movies but it's not one of the worst.",7
" Entertaining Film, Better than what DC does Lately
","The latest DC movie starring Xolo Maridueña, who gives a good performance, is a very formulaic movie and is nothing we haven't seen before and better in other superhero movies. There are some problems in the script and several nonsense moments like characters saving themselves from death just because and a family member being able to invent machines and pilot spaceships and still be poor. A lot of things that help the movie move forward happen just because or by luck. For example, how the main character gets his powers, although this is the way it tends to be in almost all superhero movies that follow this formula. The movie is riddled with cliches, some having to do with the love relationship of the main character and others with the villain, who by the way does not convince me, as it seems to me that she is just bad but has no convincing motivation to be so. There are also a lot of cliches in the comedy even though usually this one is efficient and made me laugh. There are some emotional moments that did work for me but they are still things we've seen before. There is literally one scene that felt quite similar to one from Deadpool 2, in which the main character meets his father after he is dead and about to be dead himself, but he tells him that he is still needed, that it's not his time and that he needs to go back. I like most of the characters and I think their relationships work well. The movie has a nice message, but it conveys it in a weak and unsubtle way. Good action and special effects, which is pretty weak lately so that's surprising, I also liked the design of Blue Beetle's costume. Another good point is that in some moments you felt that the danger was real, since a character actually died and not resurrected miraculously, but as I said that does happen on occasion. I had a good time, I was entertained and if a second part comes out I will go to see it. 5,5/10.",6

The only think i truly LIKED in this movie is the combat and battle scenes and there are 2-3 scenes like that in the movie. So to sum up, its not a bad movie that's not worth 8-10 dollars.

After all these years of mockery and uncertainty about the universe we finally got something. I hope James Gunn knows what he's doing.

","At first I thought this would be an okay, meh DC movie but when I finally watched it I was immediately wowed 😮😮😮.<br><br>Blue Beetle is a spectacular family movie to watch, filled with excitement, love and action!<br><br>The actors chosen for this movie are brilliant and DC do seem to be off to a great start!<br><br>If they made a Blue Beetle 2 then I would definitely watch that.<br><br>The family aspect was really taken in like Shazam 1 and Shazam: Fury of the Gods.<br><br>If you are a DC fan then Blue Beetle is definitely worth a watch!!<br><br>This movie is one hundred percent one of the better DC movies and DC is in good hands!",8
" Very enjoyable
","Blue Beetle is a quite enjoyable movie. It may not be anything new in terms of story, but it does have it's own charm. It is not as dark as other DC movies.<br><br>The movie centers more around the family and such, and carries a lot of emotion.<br><br>The chemistry between the actors was quite good. Xolo Maridueña, Damián Alcázar and George Lopez deliver a very good performance.<br><br>The sountrack has a nice 80s synth vibe and the CGI was actually quite good (unlike in The Flash).<br><br>It might not be the best DC movie, it is cheeseband a bit predictable, and there is still room for improvement, but it has heartwarming and heartwrenching moments, and is overall a very enjoyable movie.",9
" Mmm missed the mark
","So we were excited to watch this after seeing a few of the adverts on TV so as soon as it was out we were ready with popcorn in hand for the next superhero movie. Well what can I say, it had so much potential to be the DC equivalent of ant man or venom but it's really missed the mark. So yes it plays on the atypical superhero plot, of poor kid struggling though life gets a once in a lifetime chance encounter to then become a superhero... roll on some attempts at being funny, some are and some are proper roll your eyes attempts.it just struggles along with some mild gore bits that seem to be like an unfunny attempt at deadpools comedy gore.<br><br>I couldn't help but think for the second half of the film, how much are they going to push the ""you're stronger if you love your family"" message.<br><br>To be honest this is more like a straight to streaming service type film ...I actually nodded off for a few minutes and I love my superhero action films.",4
" Complete waste of time
","I thought Shazam would be the whackest movie from DC but blue beetle is worse, bad storyline, bad actions and poor graphics, they tried infusing comedy which makes it more boring. Howa Rudy able to control the techs without prior knowledge, so unrealistic. Someone needs to get across to DC they can do better. If the lieutenant already has a tech armour working for him so what else does he need the scarab for again? A wristwatch is the key? Getting it was too easy and childish. The stories just doesn't connect in anyway. The best DC would have done was to introduce batman and make him take charge of the tech aspect just like Ironman did to spiderman.",1
" Worth Watching with entire family!
","I absolutely loved it!<br><br>I went with family and we all laughed, cried, and enjoyed the movie.<br><br>The depiction of a Mexican family was authentic, organic, and at times hilarious.<br><br>The soundtrack was amazing. Each song brought me back to a different era of my life and conjured so many emotions rather than taking me out of the movie.<br><br>Xolo and the cast do a magnificent job of portraying their characters and the most enjoyable lines were those that sprinkled throughout the movie and reminded me of a certain family member.<br><br>I really hope people go to theaters to support it for a sequel.<br><br>I enjoyed that the stakes in the movie wasn't to save the universe and instead focused on what really matters in this life.<br><br>I am definitely going to see it again.",10
" One of the best dc movies oat
","Had it all good cgi which have been missing in dc a lot gods actions scenes, scenes that make you connect with the characters. If you are Latin this movie is going to make you laugh a lot it has a lot of references like chapulín colorado and series like Maria la del barrio and even with the soundtracks using songs from artists like Luis Miguel and the jokes that they made and stereotypes they just make you laugh. Also liked that they didn't use the recent formulas like force inclusion like I just want to watch a movie and enjoy it. This is one of the best movies that dc has made some people saw it like a little childish but honestly it was a perfect movie.",10
" A fun and enjoyable movie
","This movie was so much fun for our entire family. We all had a great time watching this cool movie. This is coming from a 45 year old dude with his whole family at his back. =) Theres no way all those peolpe gave it a 1-3.. Its litreally a sweet flick.. what the sweaty hairy socks dudes :/ :3.<br><br>So anyways... we just got our daugther back from camp and stuff,, And yeah.. we are still pretty psycked about this movie.. i just had to write so much stuff here because of the 600 words review, i only have like 100 more words left sooo yeahh if your reading this i just have to tell you smell my hairy sweaty weird looking toe.",8
" Awesome family movie
","My sibling and I loved it, I was really surprised by how much I've enjoyed this film and how it managed to actually tear me up at multiple instances! The story revolving family and dealing with grief was very well written and it really hit the soft spot in me to the point where I required tissuee to cry in, the plot was really good and pacing of the movie was nice, characters were all well written with their own unique backgrounds, humour was suprisingly good(better than Thor Love and Thunder THAT'S for sure). Each character felt unique in their own way and each one of them had a tragic background. 10/10 would reccomend.",10
" Entertained But Not Impressed
","This is an entertaining movie but I've seen this plot line a 1,000 times! If this is the new DCEU it's not much different from the old version. It is just less serious &amp; more fun. Which I like the fun but the future movies need to have better writing with less predictable scripts! George Lopez is the best thing in this movie! I struggled with knowing the outcome of the movie after watching 30 minutes of it. Movie studies, writers, directors, etc. Need to truly understand that if they want us to spend our money. They need to make a good product! Gotta make movies like Wonder Woman (2017),The Dark Knight, Batman (1989), Superman (1978), &amp; Man Of Steel. Especially nowadays when people will wait to stream midling movies because they don't think it's worth the ticket price. Or the word of mouth about a film isn't good. I think the hubris of the people in charge do not help this movie in my humble opinion.",6
" Mid but two characters carried this movie
","I'm literally in the theatre writing this. Movie was mid. Jamie Reyes and George Lopez (Rudy) carried this movie. Xolo's acting is ok, especially if your familiar with this stuff from Cobra Kai. I feel like a lot of movies are trying to get that cultural feel that Black Panther and Into The Spider Verse was known for and fail to do so without being cringey. Villain was cookie cutter and honestly too underpowered to be fighting Blue Beetle. They definitely pushed the ""white evil"" thing. Been there done that. I definitely felt that the family was kinda cringey too, especially the grandmother. All and all, I saw it because I like superhero movies, but it's rare I'll see one twice.",6
" A Nostalgic Ride That Fails to Stand Out
","In an era where superhero films are pushing boundaries, introducing complex characters and weaving intricate plots, Blue Beetle feels like a trip down memory lane-only the destination is 15 years ago. The film bears striking resemblance to Marvel movies from the mid-2000s, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. While it offers a few moments of genuine laughter, the overall package feels too familiar to stand out in today's saturated market of superhero films.<br><br>Plot-wise, Blue Beetle doesn't bring much innovation to the table. The narrative arc feels like it's been lifted straight from superhero films we've seen time and time again. It's as if the creators have copy-pasted elements from older Marvel movies, assuming that the nostalgic appeal would be enough to carry the film. It results in a lack of suspense and a predictable storyline that could have done with some refreshing twists.<br><br>That's not to say Blue Beetle is entirely devoid of merits. The film does manage to muster some charm through its humor. While the jokes don't break new ground, they are executed well enough to elicit genuine laughs. The comedic timing is one of the redeeming aspects that make the movie enjoyable, at least in segments.<br><br>However, this sense of humor alone cannot make up for what the film lacks in originality. With the plethora of superhero films exploring deeper themes and showcasing groundbreaking special effects, Blue Beetle struggles to justify its existence beyond serving as a superficial homage to an era gone by.<br><br>In conclusion, while Blue Beetle might offer a sense of nostalgia for fans of older Marvel movies, it fails to establish itself as a standout entry in the contemporary superhero landscape. It's not a bad film by any means-just one that you've probably seen several versions of already. If you're in the mood for an old-school superhero flick with decent humor, it might be worth a watch. Otherwise, there are more innovative options available that would be a better use of your time.",7
" Overhated/disliked
","I think this movie was one of the most fun super hero movies I've watched the last year. Sure it's not Spiderman ATSV or whatever but I deeply enjoyed this movie and how they showed off the cool powers of blue beetle that people overlook. I watched it with a friend and we agreed that this was an amazing movie with great visuals and great for kids or people who are just getting into the DC universe. Just shush and enjoy the movie and the action, trust me you'll enjoy it 20x more. A lot more people need to have in mind that sometimes it's great to turn your mind off and just enjoy the movie. ,':)",9
" Fun movie, but a bit slow to start.
","It takes 25 minutes for Jaime to actually get the scarab, but when he does things speed up greatly, even though there are several VERY UNREALISTIC scenes in the ""testing"" phase. I realise this is a sci-fi superhero ""origin"" movie, so several unrealistic items are to be expected, but for regular items to break the laws of physics goes beyond comprehension.<br><br>Eg the scene with the bus getting cut in half yet both halves remaining perfectly upright, even while skidding sideways. Or that Jaime, while freefalling from space, generated enough heat to catch on fire. The SPACE SHUTTLE will do that, travelling at 27,000 km/h on reentry, but NOT a person in freefall (just ask any parachutist).<br><br>So expect a fun story as he comes to terms with his capabilities, and the that idea he's stuck with it, but expect several periods of ""just ignore that bit "" or it'll drive you to distraction.",8
" Blue Beetle is a poorly made and disappointing film.
","Blue Beetle is a poorly made and disappointing film. The protagonist, Jaime Reyes, is from a poor family, but his family somehow knows how to fly a plane and use weapons like professional soldiers. The company that owns the scarab, Kord Industries, is a world leader in technology, but it's easier to break into than a coffee shop. Overall, this movie is a mess.<br><br>One of the biggest problems with the movie is the writing. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predictable. There are also many plot holes and inconsistencies. For example, it's never explained how Jaime's family knows how to fly a plane or use weapons. It's also never explained why Kord Industries is so easy to break into.<br><br>The action scenes in the movie are also poorly choreographed and the special effects are cheesy. Overall, this movie is a waste of time and money. I would give it a 1 out of 10.<br><br>I'm sorry that this movie didn't live up to your expectations. I hope you can find something better to watch soon.",3
" Blue Beetle ... with some SharkBoy ...
","I just wtach this new super-heroes flick.<br><br>And I have to say that I had the feeling to rewatch ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D"" in some ways.<br><br>From time to time the story telling is absurd, George Lopez is doing too much has always, flashy fluorescent colors all the way.<br><br>Put that behind, you have an honest familly movies to watch, but don't expect to remember any of it within the following hours.<br><br>Best thing I'll get from this movie is the performance of Xolo Maridueña (Blue Beetle), who was new to me at the time I writing this.<br><br>And also Raoul Max Trujillo as the villain you love to hate.<br><br>An honest 6/10 is the best it will get from me.",6
" It was good to watch
","A superhero film, that you can watch but it's nothing special. The suit, effects, cgi is good. But for me the whole movie goes too fast, i needed a moment to pause like catch a breath and enjoy more. But go and watch for yourself. It has a few meaningful moments, I like how the family values are presented. But i think it needed more like, emotional touch from creators and an editor. I'll admit that at times it's funny, has many mexican culture references, so this is nice. But I'm also worried about the dc universe with Batman changes, the Flash etc. I hope this hero will have a good future and a better universe to be in.",7
" Blue beetle is the bruce!!!
","So the the movie was very nice to watch and me and my dad enjoyed the film:the soundtrack,the balance between drama and action and the design of the blue beetle suit. Now the action scenes were awesome and dramatic to watch and it was very entertaining,my dad will now share what he thought. L (age 10)<br><br>Blue Beetle is a solid movie but lacking a strong storyline. That said it does give a decent amount of time to character development which makes up for the well trodden story. The effects are good and the action is well paced and enjoyable. Ultimately, it's a fun Saturday night popcorn movie but it doesn't set up the new DCU world too well.",8
" Amazing movie
","I dont have much to say but you have to goo see what all the hype is about. I had a blast its by far one of the funniest hero movies out, the cast blended amazingly!! The action, the emotional rollercoaster , it was a bit sad almost made me cry . It had everything you want in a movie. Seriously hope people ignore the critics and go see it. Its new, refreshing and spicy baby! Kudos to xolo and George lopez carried but overall the cast was truly amazing. I can stress this enough. Go go go. No complaints except when is the 2nd one coming out? Man i really hope they come out with sequel sooon. Praying.",10
" Go to the movies and take your own opinion!
","Blue Beetle is an absolute triumph in the realm of superhero storytelling. With its dynamic characters, engaging plotline, and stunning visual effects, this film captures the essence of the beloved comic series in a way that is both respectful to its source material and excitingly fresh. The charismatic lead brings depth and relatability to the titular character, while the supporting cast delivers performances that truly elevate the movie. The action sequences are masterfully choreographed, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats while seamlessly weaving in moments of heartfelt emotion. Blue Beetle's exceptional blend of humor, heart, and heroism make it a must-see for both long-time fans and newcomers to the genre. It's a cinematic journey that leaves a lasting impression and paves the way for a new era of superhero storytelling.",8
" Good movie bule beetle
","With the commenter that the movie was good. It was a refreshing take on the superhero genre, and Xolo Maridueña was great as Jaime Reyes. I also liked how the movie focused on Jaime's family and friends, and how they helped him become a hero.<br><br>The commenter does not mention any specific scenes or lines from the movie to support their opinion, but they do provide a general overview of what they liked about the movie. They also mention that they thought Xolo Maridueña did a good job as Jaime Reyes, which is a fair assessment.<br><br>Overall, I think the commenter's review is fair and balanced. They do not overhype the movie, but they also do not dismiss it. They simply state their opinion of the movie and provide some supporting evidence.",10
" [6.5] With some good things,but cliché and predictable.
","The movie has its moments,for sure,but,most of the time,it's just too predictable. Fight scenes and villains were very cliché. Some of the dialogue is cringe and also some acting. The characters lacked any depth. Xolo Maridueña,Bruna Marquezine,Adriana Barraza and Susan Sarandon were great with what they were given,tho. Blue Beetle's suit was fine,so was the CGI,most of the scenes. The movie's visual identity was kinda remarkable,in my opinion. Maria do Bairro and Chapolin were overused as ""jokes"",coming from a latino. Scenes that needed to be tense/sad or even funny didn't make it to me,whatever they were trying to make the audience feel. Soundtrack and directing were just fine. And for representation,personally,i don't really care,so was just fine too.",6
" Fun and enjoyable ride
","Enjoyed the movie. A bit on the nose with the genre and with the immigrant story here and there - but overall I think it really paid off it's emotional scenes and made for a fun ride. An enjoyable movie that doesn't try too hard to be anything other than a fun story with some humor and some heart. The villain is lacking - with dialogue and performance, but it gets the job done. I'm excited to see blue beetle in the future dc universe and excited for the Latino stories it can tell. A refreshing fun summer movie that i think should be given a fair chance. A fun movie that I would definitely recommend.",10
" Blue beetle is beyond terrible
","Blue beetle is even worst than I expected and, I didn't expect much from the DC franchise after Black Adam. This movie is not even worth a 1/2 star. If you are younger than 12, or have the mental aptitude of a 12 year old, maybe you could enjoy it. Blue beetle has the visual quality of the Power Rangers series from the 90's. The Special FX are so lame, it's ridiculous. The storyline is extremely predictable. The acting is terrible. My guess is, that it is more the director fault considering that Xolo Mariduña is pretty good in Cobra Kai, and I have great respect for Susan Sarandon, but it is sad to end glorious a carrer like this. This movie is a cliché of a cliché with the lame prepubescent jokes in all it's lame glory. Please dont send this to DVD it will just be a waste of plastic.",1
" Not bad
","When you go see this movie, do not expect it to be a masterpiece or an amazing movie. Just expect to have some fun watching the movie. I had a lot of fun watching the movie and you do not have to look at every single detail just look at the positivity and have fun. The movie shows a family living their life normally until a mysterious scarab attached to one of them and turns him into a super hero that barely knows how to use his powers. Like I said before after watching the movie I did not think it was a masterpiece but I had a lot of fun watching it. It was a cool origin story and I'm looking forward on what's going to happen next with the character.",7
" Sleepy!
","In reflecting upon my recent viewing experience of this particular film, I couldn't help but notice a striking predictability in its narrative arc. It almost seemed as if I had embarked on a journey where every twist and turn had been meticulously signposted, leaving little room for genuine surprise or emotional engagement. Regrettably, there were moments when the cinematic landscape failed to hold my rapt attention, and the siren call of slumber became an enticing prospect. Furthermore, the overarching impression I derived from this production was that of a constrained budget. The limited resources at the filmmakers' disposal manifested themselves clearly in the visual elements and special effects, which, though valiantly attempted, bore the marks of financial restraint. Regarding the performances of the cast and the narrative itself, I must confess to a sense of profound letdown. The portrayals, while earnest, seemed to lack the depth and authenticity that might have allowed me to forge a more profound connection with the characters and their unfolding journey. The storyline, likewise, trod a path that felt overly familiar, offering little in the way of innovative storytelling. It's imperative to underscore that the views expressed here are entirely subjective and represent my own cinematic predilections. The realm of cinema is one that thrives on diversity of opinion, and what might have left me wanting could very well be a source of enjoyment for others.",3
" Terrible acting and cgi
",The best way I can put this is it felt like I was watching a spy kids movie. The film had terrible acting the jokes were not funny. Obviously there were jokes directed towards Latino culture and I'm sure those hit for a lot of people but for someone not apart of that culture they did not. My main issue though was the cgi and how terrible it was. They did not have the budget to make a good blue beetle movie. Not to mention the story was very dragged out and also felt very lack luster the villain was very predictable and also was a terrible actor. . . .eiefwjvejscwjsvsjscsjsvsjvsjscsjsvshscsjsceve.,5
" I Agree With Critics, Haters Are Going To Hate, And This Is A Great Movie
","This was a great movie. Has William Bibbiani put it, ""It tells a familiar story in a fresh and exciting way"". And I think that describes this movie in a perfect way. This movie went back to the ""Sam Rami"" format and refreshed it to tell a new story in an exciting way. I do want to address a few criticisms though, as it seems many individuals are pretty harsh on this movie.<br><br>Chiches -
Yes, there are some ""cliches"" in the movie, but what movie doesn't have cliches. Mario, Spiderman, TMNT, all highly rated movies by critics &amp; fans alike, and all had many cliches. I don't understand why people are so harsh on the ones here, but to each their own.<br><br>Connection/Characters -
I do feel that a disconnect many may have had is that the story is around a poverty-stricken immigrant household, so many may have issues connecting, or feeling like they know the characters on a deeper level. Not to mention the many Indu windows to immigrants being mistreated by authoritative/privileged individuals. Additionally, a lot of the more subtle humor is in Spanish. So, unless you are using subtitles, or know Spanish, you may miss a lot of the humor.<br><br>All in all, this movie was amazing and is definitely one of my favorites in the DCU so far. I can't wait to see where this series goes.",8
" The Most Cookie Cutter Superhero Movie Ever Made!
","I'm going to be completely honest here: as a comic book fan, I have never actually read any of blue Beatles solo comics so those might be good, but this movie really doesn't showcase that. This just might be the most cookie cutter superhero movie that was ever created. As a comic book based movie, it should attempt to make those who are unfamiliar with a character walk away from it knowing the baseline stuff so that they are more inclined to read the comics to know more. Here however, this movie did great in doing absolutely NOTHING TO MAKE ME CARE ABOUT BLUE BEETLE!!! It's not even like it's shockingly bad, it just does nothing new. The baseline story is about a boy in a dysfunctional family that stumbles upon new technology and hast to learn how to deal with it while low slow stopping an evil threat that wishes to take over the world for the price of her own greed. What are Jaime's motives in the first place? I don't know, I think they told me but he's so one-dimensional that I don't even care about his goals if he even had any. He didn't even have a motivation to keep wearing the suit at the end, his dad had to randomly die from some medical condition in order for him to be motivated. What is his connection with his dad? I don't know they really only shared 2 1/2 scenes together so who knows? The effects were pretty good, especially with the suits, I liked the fight scenes even though they were very few and far between but beyond that there's really nothing unique about this movie. The main character is a normal teenage boy. The main villain is an evil scientist. Sure they try to make it interesting by having the right hand man kill the villain out of a change of heart but that's not really a plus because that's been done so many times. Like I said it's not a terrible movie, that's why I didn't give it a three out of 10 and there are some redeeming qualities. I thought the guy who played Jaime did an good job, The effects like I said were pretty damn phenomenal, and actually pretty exciting, and I did get a few laughs out of George Lopez being the stereotypical dirtbag uncle troop but other than that what's the point in watching this when I can watch a movie like Spider-Man across the spider verse or guardians of the galaxy three which actually go in a completely different direction from the normal and I highly recommend those movies. This one however, you're missing nothing if you skip it.",3
" Cheap flik
","The story: boring, foreseeable.<br><br>Specialeffects: boring, foreseeable, cheesy. This people who did this movie. Maybe they where kids themselves. Sepecial effects looks like plastic toys. Farting Beatle as weapon. Haha, funny.<br><br>Cheesy poor people get recognized by rich people. Oh wow no they are blessed. Also the rich sceptic uncle does a humpback in the end. So - let me see. Having fun because of good sfx? NO,
Good Story? NO
Good actors? NO way just brainless slapstick.<br><br>So what's left in this flick. Nothing seen thousand times befor just with less skill and emphathy
Thousand better super hero movies bevore even this genre is on the descending branch.",2
" I liked it, big win fir latinos
","I really loved this movie, is it kinda the generic superhero trope? Yes but it's delivered in such a fun way that it was a very enjoyable experience! Also perfect casting for the hero love Xolo! I wish the villain backstory was explored more in the beginning and that the movie had just a hour more to fully be able to express each character. Did not really like the main evil boss lady, she low key looked like she did not want to be acting or really any emotion to the role. I also felt so seen with the Love interest, it was very cool to see a Brazillian speacking português in a big dc movie! Hope to see another made soon with the family in the front and center of it!",10
" Good laughs and enjoyed it
","Funny and enjoyable movie , saw it with the whole family. I can't wait to see it again once the movie comes out. People who are gonna go see this movie, come in with an open mind. Had some good references to the old Latino culture that's what I love about this movie. The movie could be a bit better by adding more of the main villain. But the action In this movie is good. I get why people are comparing the suit to iron man but it try's to have its own vibe to it. I hope this movie gets a sequel or they add it to the DCU universe. I really want to see how this movie impacts the DCU universe . In overall I'd liked the movie.",10
" GO SEE BLUE BEETLE
","Spoilers , if u haven't seen it then don't read this review. Go and see this . Blue beetle generally is a good movie and it does deserve to break even at the box office and be profitable at the box office . I'll start with what I didn't like , even tho the family dynamic was really good I didn't like how they could take on these high tech trained soldiers. The stuff with the nana at the end can be a bit goofy , and imo if we knew her backstory a bit and it explained why she knew how to handle such a weapon like that would have those scenes look better in my opinion. I think this is the first origin movie in a while where something tragic happens to the character that they gotta overcome (like death) which I liked The acting was good from the family, Xolo is a star, the fight scenes were really good and the blue beetle suit looks great. The family dynamic was really well done (Vin Diesel would love this movie )",7
" Peak
","Blue Beetle is a DC superhero with multiple incarnations. The most well-known version is Ted Kord, who is a peak human in terms of physical abilities and possesses advanced technology in his blue suit. He's a skilled martial artist, detective, and inventor. Jaime Reyes is another Blue Beetle who has a powerful alien scarab that grants him enhanced abilities. Both versions have their unique strengths and abilities, making them formidable heroes in their own right. Indeed, Blue Beetle is a cool and strong character in the DC Universe. Whether it's Ted Kord's intelligence and gadgets or Jaime Reyes' alien scarab, each incarnation of Blue Beetle brings something unique to the world of superheroes. Their stories and abilities have made them fan favorites in the DC comic books.",9
" Unexpectedly entertaining
","I was kind of skeptical at first, but when I got into the movie, it was actually very entertaining, funny, a good origin story. I think the whole cast was a great mix. It's gonna be interesting to see when they mix blue beetle with the Batman and Superman series coming up. I think it's going to be a good Spider-Man type of mix whenever they make the universe much bigger. It's a good start. It was lighthearted and funny, catchy kind of suspenseful. I realize that most people probably won't enjoy it because of the Hispanic cast, but it was a good mix. You can't take this movie too. Seriously you just have to go in and enjoy it.",10
" Let's go!
",Blue Beetle is officially one of my new favorite DC movies right up there with The Batman and Wonder Woman. Xolo Maridueña is evidence of perfect casting as Jaime Reyes. He was so charismatic in the role and definitely kicked ass. I absolutely loved the family aspect throughout the film and the Latino culture and seeing my beautiful Puerto Rico in the majority of the film was also a plus. The entire cast was extremely charming and funny and helped deliver the heart of the film. Angel Manuel Soto did a fantastic job with the film. The colorization and musical score were perfectly balanced. I loved it 💙,9
" Fun but Formulaic
",The movie was definitely very entertaining and colorful but every single beat has been done to death in a million better superhero origin stories. As I was watching I found myself predicting the end to the movie before it even started. Even a few of its jokes like the badass grandma feel like they were tired back in 2000s Disney channel shows.<br><br>Despite how formulaic I found it when you look at it as a typical action packed superhero movie it definitely doesn't deserve to be flopping as badly as it currently is. It was more colorful and fun then most of the marvel stuff coming out now and it makes me hopeful that the new DC studios quality will only improve from here.<br><br>Just have to get passed Aquaman 2 and maybe that Superman movie will be what I'm hoping for.,6
" Virtue signaling with superhero carapace
","First line of the movie he asks a stranger how he looks with a graduation cap on, and the stranger replies ""like you are six figures in debt"". It was foreshadowing, but had to wait a least 5 more minutes to discover that the blue beetle was actually just an OP hammer ready to beat the viewer senseless with an completely un-nuanced social message on the plight of Hispanic peoples. Perhaps the most redeeming element of the movie is its focus on a strong family unit, but just when you feel like you're starting to like them, out comes the hammer again.<br><br>The superhero story was so boilerplate that it would have been comical, if only it was intended. By the end I was just worn out, skipping forward to the final fight scene which was extremely disappointing.<br><br>Normally I give a superhero movie 6/10 just because I love superhero movies. For this one, I grudgingly gave 4/10 because I pity all the special effects guys who put tons of work into projects like this.",4
" A pleasant surprise!
","Best live action superhero movie of the year for me (so far).<br><br>Xolo is such a great lead, humour is not overbearing, action is great, blue beetle suit and powers are badass. They balanced the family characters well.<br><br>Villain is weak, story is generic, a couple of plot-holes, shaky cam action can be a bit annoying at times. Movie can be 15 minutes shorter, especially at the end.<br><br>The main gripe i see people have with this movie is that is it's not breaking any new grounds, or that everything has been done before. And for me...that's okay! What matters is that its executed well. And well executed it was.<br><br>I really hope it gets a sequel!",7
" Good not great, but a great attempt for DC
","Lots of unfair biases here, I'm not a huge DC fan but I'm also not a hater. To be fair it doesn't have any crazy twists but its enjoyable<br><br>PRO:
<ul><li>Relatability. This is the biggest draw of the movie in my opinion. It's unfortunate as this movie will clearly have much less viewers due to the powerhouse names/branding of the other DC heroes. Lots of other DC movies are just too out of touch, out of reach, gods among humans. This had a POC fresh college graduate, family motivated, young adult trying to support his family.

","This a night &amp; day difference from almost every other DC Superhero film, for one - I could actually see everything!! This film is properly lit, thank goodness! There are none of those weird ass slow-motion scenes that I guess were supposed to showcase Superman's/Wonder Woman's powers, again, thank goodness. This is a true origin story (and while a definite case can be made that Superman &amp; Batman did not need DC origin stories, I feel like Wonder Woman - an origin story - was the most composed film that came out under Geoff Johns' DCEU) Xolo is so charismatic &amp; the whole cast has a ton of chemistry!!

" A good watch
","Ok, so overall it was fairly by-the-numbers in terms of story and plot, but it wasn't bad. And the characters are so lovable that it's hard to say anything bad about it. The way they show Jamie's reaction to getting the scarab and his bond with it is different from the comics, but it's still really cool and very authentic to how I think someone would react to getting something like the scarab attached to your spine without warning. Xolo Mariduena was perfectly cast as Jamie, and the rest of the casting was pretty good too. I especially loved George Lopez as Jamie's crazy uncle. If I had any complaints, it would be that the villain, Victoria Kord, was kinda by the numbers for your average superhero villain. And the secondary villain, Carapax I felt they tried to redeem at the last second after it had the least impact. If they wanted to show him as a conflicted villain, they should have made it clearer earlier in the movie. Also, Jenny Kord is, again, a bit simplistic in terms of character design. Overall, it was a good, basic, by the numbers superhero movie that I enjoyed. The special effects were awesome, the acting was pretty great, some of the characters are a little bland but it doesn't take away from much. In the end, it was cool, and I'd say worth a watch. Definitely some of the best DC content released in the last 5 years.",7

","Just watched ""Blue Beetle"" and I'm a bit disappointed, honestly. I'd rate it 4 out of 10 stars. The movie's childish tone didn't sit well with me - it felt like it was trying too hard to be funny. Humor can work, but here, it was overdone and even diluted the story's impact.<br><br>The inconsistent tone was frustrating too. It couldn't decide if it wanted to be a fun adventure or a serious exploration. This made emotional moments feel out of place. The visual effects were cool, especially the action scenes, but they couldn't save the film.<br><br>Character development was lacking. Blue Beetle's transformation felt rushed, leaving me wanting more depth. Overall, ""Blue Beetle"" missed the mark. It had potential, but the excessive humor and lack of focus held it back.",4

" THE FAST FURIOUS ain't got nuthin' on this family! 💙
","BLUE BEETLE takes the values of Hispanic culture to change the traditional tropes of comic books having no hidden origin story from family - they not only witness the transformation, but become an essential part of the fight for justice.<br><br>Drawing parallels to Neill Blomkamp's ELYSIUM, both films feature wealthy whites hoarding resources from marginalized people, mainly Hispanics, who revolt for their basic right to live. Susan Sarandon's stone cold sentiments for mankind mirror Jody Foster's presidential performance, both power hungry fatales controlling their right hand men with physical &amp; mental manipulation much to their mistake. BLUE BEETLE focuses on finding fortitude in family to fight and face whatever may come together as a unified unit. Unlike superheroes bound to secrecy, there is no hiding of identities in this household - Jaime Reyes' situation is a family affair. Every member's performance is heartfelt &amp; each bring their own individuality to the table, including a spry grandmother with a revolutionary past adding another aspect to the cultural complexity of their people's ongoing historical struggle.<br><br>Charged with rage against their cultural injustice, Blue Beetle must be reminded of mercy by his Iron Man - like suit to show empathy when he's torn between revenge &amp; humanity, reflected visually by his helmet halfway ripped revealing a tormented boy halved emotionally by the choice that will determine the kind of man he will become if consumed by misdirected hatred. Unlike Tony Stark though, there is no privilege to come to the rescue here.<br><br>Commonality can be found in the corporate exploitation of international communities, an evil greed using humans as exported commodities. Siphoning strength from suffering channels generational resilience that builds unbreakable walls against the mightiest foes. By embracing the values &amp; traditions of Hispanic heritage within its themes, including a surprisingly surreal sequence homaging a B&amp;W Mexican movie referenced earlier on their TV, the film embeds layers of cultural significance into the script.<br><br>Just as the scarab becomes a part of the Reyes family, our identities are an inseparable part of us for life.<br><br>Plus - there's a Mortal Kombat, ""get over here,"" Scorpion reference, hah!",7

All the predictable, already used clichés were used even the end credit scene was predictable (tron-ish).<br><br>The villain never did anything wrong, was trying to make the world a safe place, giving safe enviro -nment and opportunities fer growth to poor Guatemalan kids, rather than giving the power to end the world a 22 year old recent college graduate whom you just met and know qs a cleaning boy.??? Seriously!! This is all you can come up with
Only light in this ""Dark Night"", pun intended, is the special effects, they have done a really good and deserve the praise.<br><br>The jokes all went side ways and the characters were not serious enough to potray the emotions required for example : when the father died, every one went on to crack jokes immediately.<br><br>In short if these (Shazam inculded) type of movies are to be made then i would suggest WB executives should attned a workshop on movie making or something.",5
" It's a fun movie!
","The dialogue or backstory isn't the strongest but it's a great movie to watch with your children. For adults? Maybe not. It doesn't really dive into the mental of the characters like Marvel films do. I feel like they wanted to take it in that direction with the story (like when the showed the scene of the villain's childhood) but was moreso in favor of keeping it PG for the younger viewers. But to be honest, seeing the glimpse of the villain's backstory was probably the strongest scene in the movie. I definitely would've given this another star or two though had they not censored Xolo Maridueña's nude scenes.",7

This touch of levity doesn't detract from the film's emotional depth but rather enhances its relatability and entertainment value.<br><br>As a superhero film, Blue Beetle doesn't shy away from the classic elements that fans love. The exhilarating action sequences, breathtaking visuals, and a compelling origin story contribute to the film's overall appeal.

I have a feeling a lot of people pull the movie down because its from dc and not marvel. I've seen marvel movies worse then this dc movie.<br><br>Its a fun entertaining and action packed superhero movie and i enjoyed watching it. You should give it a chance and ignore the negative comments of marvel fanboys trying to pull dc down.

","I cannot believe this movie is only averaging a 6 right now. It is awesome! The fight scenes are incredible, reminiscent of Fast and Furious movies and Iron Man. The family drew me in emotionally, as I have lost loved ones the last couple years. It is perfect. The best first superhero movie I've seen since the first Guardians of the Galaxy! James Gunn knows exactly what he is doing. I believe he can turn things around at DC going forward. I cannot wait for the sequel and any other projects he gets behind. People need to stop being so dang picky! They just aren't satisfied. Superhero movies can still be great and this one is!",9
" A great start to the DCU! Fun hero with actually funny and relatable humo
","I just got home from watching the Blue Beetle movie and what a movie! It had lots of fun action that really made me care about this hero and wanting to see another installment or atleast more of the Blue Beetle. Xolo does such a great job as portraying the character and the rest of the supporting cast fill their roles greatly. I give this movie easily an 8.5 out of ten and while it isnt a crazy masterpiece it is very much enjoyable with an interesting plot. I do have to say there were lots of funny jokes that I enjoyed but lots of cringe moments that made me wonder why they were left in the film. Lots of the jokes were understood and relatable and I genuinely laughed at them but sometimes I felt like they did a little bit too much and they could have stopped. I love a super hero when hes supported by his family like the next fan does but in this movie we see they take it a little too far and things get ""silly"" and exaggerated. I would say the only person I would choose to recast would be Jaime's sister because it feels like she's too ""Disney channel"" and her acting isn't necessarily bad but it makes the movie feel a little too silly. Sometimes I wonder when they do test screenings if they genuinely understand the corny and cringe parts or if they realize them and choose to let it slide. In one line the mom says in Spanish ""go kick their asses"" as the camera pans in their face. Its just a very corny and cringe phrase and scene and it totally takes me out of the superhero movie vibe I want to feel. We are left with one real post credit scene and the ""second"" is very disappointing and not worth staying for because it doesn't have any type of relevance to DC films. I very much enjoyed this installment of Blue Beetle b y DC and I can't wait for more.",8

The vfx and practical effects all felt seamless and left nothing to be desired.<br><br>The blatant racism was funny yet realistic. I will say that the BBEG was very one dimensional and felt flat but they were able to make her very easy to hate.<br><br>All in all it's not perfect but definitely worth the ride and paying to see in theaters.

" Dominic Toretto Has Nothing On This Family
","This kickoff to the all new DCU is beautiful. The bond the Reyes family has feels so real and like nothing could break it apart. The chemistry between all the actors is some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie. While the first act of the film does feel a bit slow, by the end of act two you will realize how crucial the pace is to the story. Even though this film does an excellent job of being a standalone entry in this new universe, the little references to other DC properties are done well and by no means feel like they are beating a dead horse. The music throughout has a 80's feel that reminds you of the height of popularity for Ted Kord's Blue Beetle. What stands out the most in this film is the emotion. Everything feels real instead of the usual forced emotion we've been made used to over the last ten years. I'd be lying if I said I didn't tear up. Well done DC, you've pulled me back in. You will laugh. You will cry. More than anything though, you will want more of the Reyes family the minute the credits role.",10
" You'll not feel blue after watching this fun flick!

There were nice background nods to the wider DC world but nothing obtrusive. Nana &amp; Uncle Rudy are great! Indeed, the whole Reyes family bring so much to the film. Yes, some of it is very derivative of other comic-book movies, and Susan Sarandon, as Victoria Kord, is not given much to do as the bland villain but, it's a fun a 2 hours in the cinema without the need to have watched a dozen interconnected movies to know what's going on. Bring on the sequel! #blubeetle.",8

There are many moments of, ""Oh that's a convenient movie trope."" Okay soundtrack and fight scenes.<br><br>If you have good relationship with your family, you might connect with the movie and have a good time. If you don't, you will probably find some characters annoying.",5
" Ok I gotta keep it honest DC
","I was very exited since the moment I found out this movie was on yeh making! Huge fan from the comics ! But I don't understand why always DC have to some type way alter original history? Yes great humor ! Family! Love ! Unity! Yes even blue beetle was great! The actor did amazing! Nothing against him! But we talking about in the movie he's 22? In the comics it's between 16-18? So why making this type of way! I don't like to compared marvel stuffs but I though I was getting some type of homecoming vibes from spider man. But no they went into adult blue beetle , pushing romance and cheesy. There were a lot action! Yes and I bet the director did try he's best! As well as yeh actor ! I am Latino myself and I felt very represented on the movie but I felt the push it too much. James Gunn you are making anew DC legacy I get it , and yes sometimes there will be changes between books and movies I get it but it was this really necessary? You give us a typical young adult graduate looking for a job. Then becoming the awesome blue Beatle , you give us a beautiful girl completely new to the history! No even the one that he really like on the comics. All the movie is about him having a crush trying to be for her trying to be for his family and that's all. Far away from the comics and the origin, I was very hyped. But I gotta be honest I enjoy it the 2 hours but definitely won't be watching it again unless maybe for free in the future. If you are big fan GO watch it enjoy it you'll have a good time but don't expect too much , it's not hate towards the movie or the characters or actors I'm just feeling sorry about the fact we could have make something beautiful the right way. I feel you guys didn't give us the real blue beetle instead and Hero from hialeah Miami I'm sorry. It's the true. Why why to rush a relationship in a movie when you trying to build a character ? Don't get it here. Lol.",7

But, for what it's worth, this movie is actually worth your money and your time because it is very action packed, emotional, family-oriented and very interesting. I like the grounded approach they went with blue beetle and I believe that one of the main reasons why this movie is actually good is because of the lack of cameos from other characters making this movie feel like it's actually about Blue Beetle. This movie isn't perfect but it's the best DC entry since The Batman.",10
" Boring, cartoonish, predictable, and cliche
","Blue Beetle is a step back in twenty years of super hero movies. The formula should be pretty common by now but BB is just plain average. I really wanted to like this movie but the usual tropes and forced humor bring it down. One of the biggest problems is there is no real conflict, the beetle chooses the hero and the rest of the movie is just a chain reaction of irremediable consequences. A cartoon villain is established in the first scene and some world-conquering motive is thrown in the middle just to have you say ""look, here's the very bad guy!"". A wasted opportunity all around.<br><br>One saving aspect is the Hispanic family theme is taken very boldly. There are no token mixed-race couple for the sake of appearances here. The hero's family really shines. The movie really goes all out showing the roots of the character which is not common. Sadly, the movie is boring and not worth your time.",6

I actually have a brother who my sisters, out of love, call Cabezón! 😂🤣 The fact that there's no grotesque nudity and no inappropriate scenes made me realize I can bring my young children to watch it and I don't mind watching it again! If your children are too young, have them watch a bit of spanish novela Marimar and el Chapulin Colorado so they can understand what they mean in the movie.

I also enjoyed the perspective of first and second generation immigrants trying to make a new and better life and doing that together. The movie had a bit of melodrama and I think it might have been a nod to telenovellas, which were mentioned by the family. It definitely had some corny moments but they were charming. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and hope we see more of Jaime Reyes and his family. The tag at the end of the movie promises some more fun to come.",8

It was a family film, with a family involved through out the movie. I love the family being a part of this story line, with a bad ass grandma and uncle.

" Stop processing grief like it was nothing
","I had bad expectations. It was a good surprise for the first half of the movie. Not extraordinary in any way, but quite enjoyable. Then the writers made a bad choice for the tone of the movie by creating a drama in the middle of the movie (which was totally not necessary) , and then make all the characters just have real fun while using cool tools and killing bad guys like nothing happened. The movie lost me at that point. There is even a scene where the grandma have a big smile while the others are trying to act a bit like they still feel at least a bit what happened. God, this is so stupid. No real emotions, and the characters that were quite relatable weren't anymore. I think the writers do not understand that while people usually need fun to engage in a movie these days, it's not actually bad to had true emotions at some point when the viewer is engaged with the characters. But no, let's just have fun the entire time, regardless of having to confront grief. You can laugh while living such grief, and even just after, but you can't just ignore it and just make fun all the time, just by saying ""it's not the time to cry"". If you want to keep that tone for the entire show, don't create such drama in the middle of it, or process it correctly. Guardians of the galaxy got it right, this movie didn't. I bet that the same movie, just avoiding the drama, would have had 7+ on average reviews instead of 6+. There is a lot more to say, indeed, but that was the main concern on my part. Stop writing on stuff you never actually experienced, or at least do solid research on it.",4

It is funny, it is exaggerated, it is amusing, it is interesting. Unlike many other movies of the genre. I gave it a straight 10. Why do you hate it so much? Because Mexicans have it hard in the States? And you blame THEM about it?! Jesus, guys! LIfe sucks enough as it is, do w have to hate good movies because of politics? ""10 year olds yadayada""?! I am a Croatian living in Austria - pretty much the same thing, so I get it. It is time you start getting it too!",10
" Deserves a 7.5
","Really great movie. My kids loved it. My wife and I loved it (and we hates superhero movies). I was disappointed to see George Lopez in the movie, with his history of stealing jokes...but everyone deserves a second chance, and he nailed it.<br><br>I won't post any spoilers, but I will say give it a shot. I'd bet your family will enjoy it too! Lots of great jokes, non-cheesy CGI, and solid acting from a younger crowd. It was a fun film that my entire family enjoyed. I'm glad we bought it, because it immediately became a family favorite. And props to Target for having a solid selection of Blue Beetle merch, ready for purchase!",10
" Very fun superhero movie
","Expected a regular origin movie but the fights, visual effects, family storyline really made it a fun movie with some substance that didn't feel pointless. The character faced real loss but also gained purpose. The demographic representation wasn't done in a cheesy or offensive manner which is a big plus. Overall a really fun watch with funny moments, awesome visual effects and fights. This movie doesn't try to take itself like a serious drama to make it cringe worthy but it also doesn't go all the way senseless comedy to make it not have any substance. Great cast, decent plot, awesome visually, it's like a DC cartoon was made live action. Definitely recommend for a fun watch.",8
" Amazing
","The movie is really good. It.is really engaging and fun. Even if you're not watching it at the movies/theater it feels like it. I feel like the actors are perfect for their roles and are good at playing them. If you expected something else of course you'd say that the movie was not what it should have been or how it should have been but personally I feel like it's just right, like every line fits the whole blue Beetle style. Although you may prefer to see the Ted version of the blue Beetle which we may see as teased in the post-credits scene where he sends a message to his computer. Expecting a sequel.",10
" Solid super hero concept & story, but not enough
",This movie could've been a lot better I'm sure we all can agree. I wish they would've kept the main character as a passionate and serious individual rather than giving him goofy and awkward traits that mirror Shazam. Giving the fact that the character comes from a indigent family and was willing to go to college to get his family out of their struggle only seems right to avoid the funny business.<br><br>They also teased the action for the main character the entire movie all the way until the end. It was exhausting! Like we came here to watch Blue Beetle and see what he's about instead watched him not fight to his full capacity because he's too much of a panzee to hurt anyone 90% of the movie.<br><br>Overall I love the character concept and I hope they do better show casting his abilities to their fullest in the next movie!,6
" It's really good ,music?
","The movie was good I guess I really love music I was
Waiting for a soundtrack . Overall the movies was good. It has Mexican cultural is good .just need more action overall good more music .<br><br>The movie is great for family to see it together and to have fun together,
some characters could do better for the next movie for characters development but everything good.<br><br>Overall the movie is amazing I like the superhero style and it was amazing I feel like there should more Mexican
Superhero's.<br><br>Also dc and marvel should join and blue bettle should fight with other heroes in other movies and yeah !!!!",7
" Just Great!
","From the moment ""Blue Beetle"" began, I was instantly captivated. The film seamlessly blends heartwarming moments with exhilarating fun, making it an absolute joy to watch from start to finish. The characters are brilliantly crafted, each bringing their own unique charm to the screen. The storyline is both engaging and touching, with moments that had me laughing out loud and others that tugged at my heartstrings.<br><br>The cinematography is top-notch, with breathtaking visuals that transport you directly into the world of ""Blue Beetle"". The soundtrack complements the film perfectly, enhancing the overall experience.<br><br>In a world filled with so many movies, ""Blue Beetle"" stands out as a shining beacon of what cinema should be - a delightful escape that leaves you feeling uplifted and entertained. I wholeheartedly give this film a well-deserved 10 stars. If you're looking for a movie that's both loving and fun, look no further. ""Blue Beetle"" is a must-watch!",10
" Faithful to DC's Legacy
","As a DC fan from the 90's, I can say this movie was a pleasant surprise.<br><br>More than any other comics publisher, DC Comics is characterized by its heroes' lineages and legacies. For instance, Jaime Reyes is the third DC hero to carry the name Blue Beetle. It is not necessary to be familiar with the hero's previous incarnations to understand or even enjoy the movie, but it is a delight to see how much the movie is respectful to them, specially Ted Kord, his immediate predecessor and the hero I used to read in the 90's. Additionally, it is a treat to spot references to Batman, to Gotham, and the other heroes, as if it the movie truly exists within a cohesive DC Universe.<br><br>If I were to pinpoint a weak spot, it would have to be the villains. Many have commented that they could have been better, and I couldn't agree more.<br><br>That being said, the movie is packed with humor. Most of the jokes had me laughing, while a few made me cringe.<br><br>Approach the movie expecting a hero movie with slapstick moments and you will be pleased as I was. Check out the trailer to understand the movie's tone.<br><br>I wouldn't go so far to say this is the one of the greatest movies ever made, but it was certainly good enough. I walked out of the cinema feeling lighthearted and yearning for more.<br><br>P. S.: It is worth noting that I'm Brazilian and it brought me some joy to see that both the co-star actress and her character are from Brazil.",8
" Best movie I've watched this year (my opinion)
","SPOILERS !!! This movie was AMAZING I loved it so so so so much the costume was amazing, the jokes were so funny and I understood EVERYTHING which made it funnier I don't know how anyone could rate this a 5?! For me it was a 10!!! It was funny but also very sad I loved how towards the end he combined both of the weapons to make a sword and the reference of cloud from final fantasy also loved how they put Selena Quintanilla bidi bidi bombom and la chona this movie was amazing I loved everything about this movie 10/10 will watch it again and again and AGAIN ( whoever rated it a 1-6 y'all probably don't like us Hispanics or just didn't get the jokes and just didn't watch it until the end tbh😭)",10
" A really good movie don't listen to other reviews.
","Even though other reviews are calling this movie bad and generic, I thought that it was a great dc movie and it definitely doesn't deserve the reviews it is receiving. The story was pretty good even though it was quite similar to the first antman movie from 2015. The film had some very funny moments and kept me entertained for the entire 2 hours and 7 minutes.<br><br>Xolo mariduena's acting was really good and it was great to see the cobra Kai actor getting his big screen debut as blue beetle.<br><br>The movie is doing very well for being released mid strike 6 weeks ago and hopefully it does better since the strike is now ending.",7
" Too much esentiments...too less action and story
",Being a DC fan.... When i saw the trailer of this movie i thought this might be the one where DC will make a strong comeback with this movie...it actually looked good and funny....but when i actually watched this movie it was exactly opposite to that....the movie is outright boring and unimaginitive...felt like watching a 90s movie<br><br>Story wise the movie is induced with lot of sentiments and somewhere i felt like watching a family drama rather than a superhero movie...all the action is left for the last thirty minutes...<br><br>Those thirty minutes are also filled with unnecessary family sentiments...nothing different to a n old spy kids movie where whole family is talented ..uncle is a genius and wknows everything including flying a plane to inventing a jammer....no backstory to any character....poor character development....and a granny who can shoot a machine gun...seriously DC should come up with something really better to overcome these crappy movies.,4
" My review
",As a Latino myself I loved the family aspect to it. It felt so real and it was so grounded Anguel Manuel Soto absolutely knocked it out of the park. Xolo is blue beetle he brought his A game. As a comic book nerd I loved everything about this film it's a once in a lifetime film and the Easter eggs and references all around it please a fan. The cinematography in this film truly makes it feel like a comic book film. And even if you weren't a fan of the hero genre you can watch this without knowing the lore of blue beetle and come in and see the chemistry between all the characters it is a real treat.,10
" A really great sentimental family to watch with the family
",I was smiling from the start and there was moments where I got emotional . The movie is relatable to POC. The importance of family is represented and honestly there was so many cute moments shared. It shows with your loved ones by your side any hurdle is possible to overcome. The movie start to finish was mind blowing . A lot of thought was put into it . I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. It had a lot of great lessons to learn from it. I would highly recommend. There is an end credits scene so you should wait for that. I would defo watch it again. I didn't realise how much I needed this until now.,10
" 10 out 10
","Came in the theater with high expectations and was NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!! Watching Cobrai Kai and seeing his determination and dedication to his role and the way he portrayed his character and seeing him act as Blue Beetle a new environment for him. But he did better than I ever was hoping!!! XOLO MARIDUENA IS THE GOAT... THE GOAT.... Go see it for yourself. STRIKE FIRST STRIKE HARD NO MERCY👊🏻 Absolutely insane can't believe how good and amazing this movie was, the family love in this movie and the Hispanic culture is incredible. If you see this movie you will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. GO XOLO MARIDUENA!!!",10
" Worth watching
",This is a major win for DC and WB. I did not go to the cinema hall with big expectations given the way things have been with other recent superhero movies but Blue Beetle stood out from the rest and delivered a delightful experience which i haven't felt since the first wonder woman movie. The action scenes packed a punch and comedy was just the right amount and did not feel forced. The movie doesn't focus on continuity to wider DC universe (except a few name drops) which feels like a breath of fresh air and makes it easy for non-comic book audience to keep up. Overall it's a good movie and worth watching.,7
" Loved it, Loved Xolo, I need to watch Cobra Kai.
","This movie was so good, I cried, I laughed and fell in love. I hardly watch DC but this, this was a powerful movie on many different levels. I think the acting was quite good, the representation of the Mexican community is everything and the portrayal of love and togetherness through Jaime Reyes' family is so so beautiful. The movie was also very funny, and I especially loved the grandmother she is so strong, wise and added a lighter touch to the sad parts. I think everything was perfectly balanced in this film, there was enough funny moments but not too many as to take away the seriousness of the film; there was a good amount of sadness as well but yet again not too much as to make the film all about it, plus you can't have a superhero origin story without a bit of loss, If there was no loss this film would not be what it is, the character development is dependent on the loss and sadness. I also really loved how they incorporated the romance between Jaime and Jenny, it was such a good slow-burn, there was constant tension between them and they were finally able to explore it at the end. It wasn't like they immediately fell for each other, it was a slow, realistic progress. Speaking of realistic, the family and their reactions and relationships are very realistically portrayed in the film. I mean if there was a blue bug that attached itself to my face and flew me out of the roof i'm pretty sure my mom would also call the police. With the negative comments, I do agree that the film might have been a bit boring or predictable to some but I do not feel that way myself, therefore the 10 stars (I also don't know how to properly rate a film lol, it's so much easier doing a review) I also find it a bit strange that the grandmother was so skilled with that massive gun, like how was she able to carry that weight as well as use it? But ofc there's a bit of a missing story which we also still need. I'm very hopeful and excited for the second movie!",10
" a good beginning
","This is my very first review on IMDB. Apologies for my English and lack of adjectives as I am not native.<br><br>The Blue Beetle manages to push the right emotional buttons. The first 2/3 will keep you tight in the movie seats. It's all there:the vulnerable family who needs a hero.the hero who doesnt want to be a hero but out of a sudden is facing a mythical alien tech (which doesnt't stop to tickle the viewer's fantasy until the end) which turns him into a superhuman force.a serious undertone in the movie which, in the first 2/3 of the movie, keeps the atmosphere very dense, Superman-style. Despite the all-out-happy-jolly Hispanic family vibe, the serious undertone, driven by the weight of responsibility on his shoulders, remains.the Hispanic family is a perfect choice because it gives the movie a lot of the energy in the first half and prevents it from being a dark science fiction movie misplaced in a colourful Miami Beach type of setting.<br><br>The scene where he protects the family from the SWAT teams is intense. The musical background is unbelievably well chosen.it's really all there: the love story between an underdog and a rich girl. Nicely built up until the end. Chemistry is there. The protection of something very vulnerable. The chase for an ancient artefact. Setting in a futuristic beach metropolis with positive vibes as opposed to a polluted depressive blade runner atmosphere.<br><br>All in all, the first 2/3s of the movie deliver on all fronts.but then things start being comical. First the vulnerable granny turns out to be a nutty ex-guerrilero. Then there is hispanic hop hop as background to fights - which is a no no no.the character development comes to a standstill out of a sudden and I felt a first yawn. Towards the end the movie gets its ""act together"" (pun intended) again, but does not live up to the very high expectations it set itself in the first 2/3s.shame. Very captivating for the large part.<br><br>A sequel is coming. My wishlist: a little bit darker but not depressive, less slapstick, a bit more love-story, a bit more character development and let the alien tech be far more powerful that what we have seen. And above everything: this first movie has built up quite the expectation of him finding his ultimate true destiny and I think this requires a far greater Destiny than to defeat a human cyborg on Earth.",7
" Wholesome, fun.
","I rarely ever write reviews, but I had to for this one. This movie touched my heart due to the family aspect of it, it felt really personal. Loved the humor, fight scenes, everything really. Did feel a bit short, but I don't think that's a bad thing. Maybe that's just because I loved it.<br><br>This movie definitely got me out of that superhero movie fatigue and got me excited to see what's next in this new dc universe. I really hope audiences get excited to see this as much as I did, it's the only way we'll get a DC equivalent to the MCU. The movie was great standalone and I can't wait to see what's next for this superhero.",10
" Don't listen to what people say.
","This is one of the best solo superhero movies I have watched. And believe me, I have watched almost every superhero movie. It was fun, the suit looked really cool and fight scenes were fantastic.<br><br>The reason why its a disaster at box office is because people are stupid. They will watch every stupid movie marvel has to offer but they hate DC. Or the reason is that DC is straight up cursed with bad luck.<br><br>This movie is fun to watch for young people. The music choice is very good. If you want to watch a fun, superhero movie with not so complexity than this movie is for you.<br><br>At the end I just want to say watch the movie and support DC so it makes more movies or it will go bankrupt.",10
" Too many cooks - Bring noise cancelling headphones
","The producers have so much to answer for. This is clearly a case of post-production hatchet-job<br><br>The first half of the movie is just people screaming and complaining. This was clearly added in post by some idiot producer trying to create drama. DO NOT WATCH THIS IN A CINIMA WITH A LOUD SOUND SYSTEM - I almost walked out<br><br>The depiction of latinos as hyper-over-reacting was absurd, and crossed the line of being offensive<br><br>This movies credits font &amp; styling is an unexplained copy of ""Thor love and thunder"". Many musical rifts are copied from stranger things. None of the song choices make sense or match anything that's happening and just shows that some executive wanted their childhood favourite song in there.<br><br>Thematically there are clear hints of Lara Croft and India Jones and many others.<br><br>I hold out hope that this was a movie with a unique story and vision - and that it was distorted into nonsense by many producers who all wanted their own spot in the sun. Sadly, we will never know.",2
" CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MORE BLUE BEETLE!!!
","I had a great time watching Blue Beetle. It was funny, thrilling, action-pack, and with surprisingly a sad/emotional element to it. Xolo Mariduena is the perfect actor to play as Blue Beetle. Me and my brothers were so excited once we heard Xolo Mariduena was casted to play as Blue Beetle. He brought charisma and excitement to the character. He is caring, passionate, and a hard worker, like most Mexicans! He made the character very likable and that is what Blue Beetle is all about. The director, Angel Manuel Soto, did an outstanding job representing Mexicans/Latinos in the big screen, and I thank you for that! Everything felt so natural and not forced. Me being a Mexican-American has even encouraged and motivated me to keep on going and echandole ganas!! Overall, me and my brothers had an amazing time watching Blue Beetle. I hope we can get to see him more in the new DCU!! THANK YOU!!!",10
" Great family fun.
","A movie with family at its heart. This is one of the first super hero movies where you do not have to be afraid of your child feeling like killing for the greater good is OK. Even one of the villains reclaims his humanity.<br><br>The main character, Jaime, is so relatable. The family is wonderful and a sense of love and togetherness no matter what. My son cried when Jaime's dad died which is great since Marvel puts him to sleep. I loved all the Spanish and Mexican references. This film really touched my heart and my son's. My non- Latino husband liked it very much.<br><br>There was comedy, action, great acting, and sad moments. A great villain played wonderfully by Susan Sarandon.<br><br>The Reyes family really delivered a great representation of a Latino family. Together they are the Blue Beetle. This was a movie about humanity more than about some alien or other planet super heroes and villains.<br><br>Yes, grandma ""nana"" was over the top but it was still great.<br><br>I have not seen the last eight Marvel movies because they have no depth. Finally, a movie that has heart.<br><br>I am Cuban-American and I am very happy to see a Latino cast that can appeal to a wide audience because you don't have to kill to be a super hero. You can find a super hero in your family just like Jaime's dad who sacrificed everything for his family.",8
" Great movie, Great tribute to Latin culture
","I loved the movie, very funny and entertaining, I loved the soundtrack because it made a tour of some classics of Latin music. It also recounted many details that are part of the pop Latin culture. The film is entertaining from beginning to end and keeps viewers on their toes, it is very much about the family unit in the Latino culture. The characters in the film did a very good job, each one adopted his role in the best way, George Lopez is a genius and how he always stood out. I can't wait to see the second installment of this movie and I predict that it will be a great success, I hope it will also be part of the DC Comics universe and we can see this character in other DC movies.",10
" A Captivating Journey with Blue Beetle: A Latin Perspective
","In a cinematic landscape flooded with superhero extravaganzas, the Blue Beetle movie emerges as a shining gem that demands attention. From its captivating storyline to its authentic portrayal of the immigrant experience, this film holds a unique place in the hearts of both comic enthusiasts and those seeking a meaningful cinematic experience.<br><br>As a fervent follower of superhero narratives, I can confidently declare that Blue Beetle ranks comfortably within my top 5 favorite superhero films. The narrative's blend of action, emotion, and relatable themes is a testament to its exceptional storytelling. What struck me most profoundly was the genuine connection I felt with the character and his circumstances, given my own experiences as a Latin individual.<br><br>What sets Blue Beetle apart is its masterful depiction of the immigrant journey. The director's ability to translate the complexities of life as an immigrant onto the screen is nothing short of astonishing. The trials and triumphs that the protagonist faces mirror the struggles that many immigrants encounter in real life. This movie captures the essence of longing for a better future while simultaneously grappling with the challenges of adapting to a new culture. It serves as a reminder that heroes are not just defined by their superhuman abilities but by their resilience in the face of adversity.<br><br>A pivotal aspect that contributes to the film's brilliance is the casting of Xolo in the role of Jaime Reyes, the Blue Beetle. This choice is a stroke of genius, as Xolo embodies the character flawlessly. His performance is both sincere and captivating, elevating the character beyond the pages of the comic book and bringing him to life on the silver screen. The casting is so impeccable that one can't help but feel that Jaime was destined to be portrayed by Xolo all along.<br><br>As I immersed myself in the world of Blue Beetle, I couldn't help but reflect on the character's potential future in the cinematic universe. I fervently hope that this compelling character continues to grace the screens in future films. The rich depth of Jaime's narrative arc and the issues he addresses are deserving of exploration and expansion.<br><br>In conclusion, the Blue Beetle movie is a triumphant fusion of superhero excitement and heartfelt storytelling. Its ability to resonate with Latin audiences, its authentic portrayal of the immigrant experience, and the outstanding performance by Xolo make it a cinematic masterpiece that deserves acclaim. As the credits rolled, I was left with a sense of anticipation and eagerness to witness the next chapter of Blue Beetle's journey on the big screen.",9
" Favorite superhero movie ever!! 💙💙💙
","100 stars out of 10! Blue Beetle is by far my FAVORITE movie of the whole year!!! I am so in love with the Reyes family, especially Jaime, who is played by the amazing and comedic Xolo Mariduena. Everyone did such an outstanding job bringing this superhero to life. The movie is funny, action-packed, and focused on the power of family and love. I cannot fully stress how important it is for as many people as possible to see and support this spectacular movie!!<br><br>I have already seen it three times and I could just watch it over and over again. I love everything about it. Thank you DC! We needed this cast and this movie. 🌟🔥",10
" Best DC movie in 2023.., with references.
","I think other users already explained and evaluated the movie in both ways, so I'll skip that part to focus directly in the relationship of the movie with the popular culture either comics, media and TV.<br><br>In DC Comics Jaime Reyes was introduced as the new Blue Beetle after an event in comics (DC) named Infinite Crisis, where the second Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) died.<br><br>That Kord Blue Beetle became extremely famous during the 1980s and 1990s fighting alongside great characters as Superman and Batman, member of the Post-Crisis Justice League, and Booster Gold's best friend. Once he was in coma trying to fight Doomsday where Superman died failing in his intent, and ultimately dying in 2005 with an unexpected encounter. All his gadgets and the Bug Mobile were based in the alien technology that Kord studied in the alien scarab he got from his antecesor, the original Blue Beetle from 1939, an archeologist.<br><br>Same scarab, the same one like in the movie, got on the hands of Jaime Reyes becoming the new Blue Beetle. To be honest I actually don't know much what happened after 2005 as I stopped reading comics. But I rediscovered him during the cartoon Young Justice living in El Paso, Texas, helping young metahumans.<br><br>So basically the movie from a comic reader perspective, has many elements from the comics: the scarab, the bug mobile (what a nostalgia!), the suit, the gadgets.<br><br>I put 8 stars out of ten because of the great actors' performance, and the inclusion of Susan Sarandon. However, there's a lot of clichés that have been copied from other movies. This movie has future.<br><br>And by the way for those who don't understand, the cartoonish red character with the CH inside the heart on his chest, with the antennas and hammer, is a very famous character created by Mexican television during the 1970's intending to mock the American superhero. Chapulin Colorado (Red Cricket) was his name.",8
" Going back to classics. Blue beetle for a new younger generation.
","Personally I NEVER review things, however i made an account for this. I loved this movie, I truly enjoyed it. I grew up in a house filled with comic books and i have been a die-hard DC fan for over a decade. Unfortunately, i was one of those people on board with pretty much every DC live action in the last 8 years has been a colossal failure. Bad casting bad story telling just terrible movies. If anyone asked me i told them go to the official DC Animated movies, because the live actions after superman's Cavill weren't worth it.<br><br>This is the first one in a long time to get back to the core of one of DC's oldest comics. Blue Beetle in the beginning from Dan Garrett, to Ted Kord, and to Jaime Reyes just wanted to help people, keep their loved ones safe. Like Ted Kord, who wasn't even chosen by the scarab just wanted to help people, as a regular human.<br><br>I've seen my fair share of complaints that this is just another spider-man cop-out. Blue Beetle has been around a lot longer, he has just never gotten good representation.<br><br>I Personally Believe the casting choice for this was well done. The actors brought their best to the table.<br><br>The tricky thing is judging this as an adult, the jokes were good even if they felt childish to some. You have to remember what it was like to be in your 20's with your siblings at home. Yes it was your traditional hero's Journey that is told in nearly every story nowadays, however it was done in a way that keeps it interesting. Jaime's Blue Beetle has always been centered around him being young and wanting to do the best he can. Protect his family, learn and grow. I feel they did a wonderful job of representing the family values that have always been a core integral part of Jaime's character evolution.<br><br>For the market we are in nowadays its hard to make a movie everyone will enjoy. They took and old story, and gave us an all new revamped Blue Beetle. I hope it pays off. This movie made me feel like a kid reading the comics again, a good modern origin story.<br><br>If you read all that thanks for taking the time, i just felt the need to get this out there after watching the movie with my sister this afternoon. Thanks for reading, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.",9
" A humble born of a hero and a cinematic universe.
","Blue beetle is well known as the first step of this new universe of dc and began with a great movie to enjoy and learn about the value of the family. The setting is in a city inspired on the latin culture that is a pride as argentinian see this representation on the big screen. The ost is powerful and each momente that plays, you cant ignore the epics moments and fights through the film. It is a classical superhero movie so, it is important to keep the basic concepts or in other words ""cliché"" because this is the form to identify this kind of movie genre. If you really want to see the humble born of a new superhero, this movie will surprise and move you.",8
" Not as bad as made out
","Quite honestly it is what it is, could of done with a 30min cut to make it better. But on the whole it's a lot better than these pathetic fan boy reviews will have you believe, definitely worth a watch.<br><br>It was a fun ride once it got going. I'd only read Blue Beetle as a bit part in main DC characters comic books so actually enjoyed the origin stuff and references to the original blue Beetle. Really just saw it as a one off to introduce him for the next Justice League outing. Saying that though I'd definitely go and see a sequel if there ever was one. As I said at the beginning it was worth a watch and I'd probably watch it again.",7
" relatable and funny
","People said this was a ""predictable"" movie? Every single hero movie is the same plot... just with minor differences. This movie was great, people need to stop hating DC movies simply because they're DC. Xolo is a great superhero, I really hope to see a number 2. This movie was so funny and relatable. As a hispanic, it was also really nice to have representation. I was really sad they couldn't promote due to the strikes, this deserves so much more. Stop comparing this to Ant Man or any other Marvel movie. It's worth the watch. Stop being a hater and only loving the classic heroes like Spider-man. I laughed, I cried, I loved it.",10
" Meh
","Giving this 3/10 because it had a few funny moments. Other than that it's the same recipe as every superhero origin movie for the last 20 years. In fact as others have said it just feels like DC decided to copy both Spiderman and Ironman at the same time so they didn't have to bother with two film franchises. Loaded with predictably cheesy moments where it looked like the hero would lose but magically finds more power to defeat the badguy at the end. The bad guys were entirely forgettable and dull. For most of the film I couldn't have told you either of their names at any point. If this is DC's idea to compete with Marvel then I won't be watching many of their films. It just feels like a spoof copy with the same formula and a few jokes thrown in.<br><br>Also, for the love of god, could we please have something a bit more interesting than evil white capitalist as the badguy for a change?",3
" Loved It!
","Great movie! Theater was filled with people of the global majority. Little kids left feeling good. Representation is important! It's the best DC movie I've seen all year. Family was at the core of this movie and you could feel it in the audience.<br><br>The antagonist was a little lacking and they could have had more interaction between Jaime and the symbiote, but it was still good. George Lopez was on point as always. The rest of the cast did well to carry the story along. Grandma was amazing! They used her well to pull the family together and orchestrate the emotions. I will definitely watch this movie again!!!",10
" Noice
","Realy love the movie I also love the way the described his ""special"" movement in his lower body like the comics. And the sound track is good love the final fight. Nana is such a badass it's funny and serious at the same level. The post credit scene was really chocking that the original blue beetle was still alive so I wonder what's going to happen with that. The sacrifice the scientist made was truly sad even though we knew him for like three minutes. Just loved it great acting great casting, just great I just can't wait for the sequel to come out soon. I hope we see more people with the scarab like in Young Justice.",10
" Refreshing!!
","I personally don't enjoy super hero movies, but was curious about a Mexican superhero. The movie did not disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised with the humor and careful attention to detail as it pertains to the culture. The actors were made for their roles, were relatable and fit right in. Although I could have enjoyed more super hero action, such as saving lives in precarious situations...I understood the premise of the movie and it's focus on the origin of Blue Beetle. The movie was entertaining, refreshing, and on point! I definitely recommend and will watch again. Looking forward to the sequel!!!",10
" Fresh take on DC superhero movie
","In my opinion most DC movies are missing some light, colour and humor. In Superman movies they forget the clumsy and nerdy side of Clark, in the newer Batman movies the excentric party side of Bruce Wayne is left out and so on.<br><br>Most times the movies do not have fun scenes, are mostly filmed in the dark and are a little creepy.<br><br>Aquaman and Shazam turned this around, and Blue Beetle takes it one step further.<br><br>The used music is great, a lot of scenes in daylight and even the action scenes mostly clearly visible. The backstory of the character is well told, with enough details, there are enough emotions going around and you feel connected to the characters.<br><br>I liked the jokes in the movie, and the feel of a 21 year old kid way over his head in trouble and being guided by his familia.<br><br>All in all, refreshing course they are working on. Hope Kevin Feige will be able to continue this.<br><br>This movie is just fun to watch and deserves better turnover.",8
" It was amazing
","Honestly, this movie was so good and heartfelt. The fact that people didn't really like is shocking because from other stuff ESPECIALLY the flash and even Shazam 2! Blue beetle has been the best movie dc has released! This wasn't an origin story it was a quick introduction on how blue beetle came to be and it was his mini start! I wasn't expecting the villain to be all crazy because again it wasn't meant to be that type of movie. I'm hoping we get more blue beetle and xolo maridueña did such an amazing job. I rate this 10/10 regardless of what I put the rating at on this. Looking forward to more.",9
" MOVIE WAS AMAAING
",Instead if safe the world and taking over the world we got a guy who trust trying to find his way and he did and he ended up a superhero and his love for his family made him stronger and the story was amazing just like the old cartoons. This was engaging and magnificent it was amazingly good and I enjoyed it to the fullest.<br><br>If you looking for a simple family movie where a kid just searching for ways to help his family then ended up saving them this movie if for you.<br><br>From start to finish this movie was amazing and it had me on my feet and and yall will enjoy this movie I guarantee so sit back.,10
" Over hated
","DC has struggled lately with their movies and has been a mess. People instantly critic DC movies and come in with a negative sight. If you go into this movie with an open mind, you will be surprised.<br><br>The movie is a really fun and energetic action piece. One of my personal favorite DC characters, Blue Beetle is portrayed fantasticly by Xolo. This movie is definetly over hated. Its a fun movie, with a great story. Some of the lines/writing is a bit meh and some scenes are not needed. Most of the characters in the movie are really cool and really fun. CGI is also surprisingly really good. I also love the music choices as they make the scenes really really good and really fun to watch. I laughed so much during this movie.<br><br>I landed on 7 on the rating scale. The movie has some misses, where i think the villain of the movie is meh. It's a bit rushed and i kinda dont know the full backstory or reason. You only get small hints. I also think some scenes and lines were really like, not needed.<br><br>If you are looking for a movie with a lot of fun, action but also family based, then you will love this movie. Definetly over hated!",7
" Beetles Advocate
","Awesome flick paying homage to the Hispanics with no superheros. People are going to criticize it now , but this one is going to be one of those cult classics that gets its flowers as time goes on. From humble roots to living in a city where no one accepts you an looks down on you . This film embodies those that struggle to belong and gives them a cool blue iron man to look up to. Great comedic relief from the supporting cast especially George Lopez which I generally don't find funny but he nails that crazy conspiracy uncle vibe. Don't take the film too serious an watch it with your kids. Check out their reaction an you'll see them enjoy it for what is .",10
" Silly and embarrassing hero and its story
",It is like a funny movie but not that funny. Hero movie but the hero is such an idiot... embarrassingly silly. Just yelling to make noises all the time.<br><br>Probably the movie is more suitable for kids who is less than 18? Not sure what kind of group people the director wishes to make this film for.<br><br>Movies like Iron man are more capable for DC type film.<br><br>The main character s face also looks so naive. The whole movie can be completed within 1hr. But the director just create too many silly scenes just to make the movie longer than 2hrs.<br><br>The movie might be amazing before iron man 1. But these days. This movie is just a trash.,3
" Mexican Super Hero Movie
","Mexican Super Hero Movie for a change.<br><br>Some stereotypes about tacos and Taco truck lol.<br><br>The Bad guys are the big American company taking advantage of the locals. I'm surprised they didn't cast a Chihuahua as their pet dog.<br><br>Overall it was better than Shazam and Black Adam.<br><br>Before I went to see the movie I didn't know that it starred Xolo Maridueña from Cobra Kai, so that made the movie more enjoyable. I only went to see this movie to take my dad out who is visiting me, and it was on a Tuesday, which is discount movie day. There probably will be another one made, but I'll wait till it goes to streaming to watch it.",6
" Worst move in the genre i've seen.
","This by far the worse yet, story hardly there, nothing to keep me interested. Too much politics and hate. This needs deleting from the world.<br><br>Disdain for The White Race.. CHECK
Disdain for Men.. CHECK
Disdain for The Wealthy, CHECK
Disdain for Tradition, CHECK
Disdain for America, CHECK
Disdain for Western Values.. CHECK.<br><br>Disdain for Good Story Telling..

Predictable smash all the things move.. sad<br><br>Dry characters, no development.<br><br>This movie was written by a five year old, directed by a snail and published by prehistoric cave painters.",2
" PLEASE watch and be the judge yourself! :)
","At first I was skeptical to watch it since EVERY DC movies has been trash but to my surprise this movie was good and funny to watch! Perhaps many people here didn't enjoy it since most of the jokes/parts would only be understood if you grew up in a Spanish household. I absolutely loved it and give it a 9/10, would've loved more fighting scenes from blue beetle. I loved how it included some reality parts from a Hispanic family such as the vapor rub or your Nana praying over you or how strong a Hispanic house hold can be and despite of what happens to us we overcome obstacle together as ONE! AGIAN please watch and you be the judge! :)",9
" Really wanted to like this
","I created an IMDB account just to say how awful this movie is. I was really looking forward to watching this, but, it was a let down. The plot was subpar and they made Jamie almost as insufferable as Elizabeth Keen from Blacklist. I did enjoy the casting, but, overall this is by far the worst DC movie I've ever seen. This movie could have gotten its point across in 90 minutes. Instead, we got a long and drawn out abomination that's not enjoyable or fun. Blue Beetle has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Save yourself time and money and wait until it's free. But, even then it's not worth the watch.",1
" So much wasted potential.
","I was a huge fan of the Ted Kord era Blue Beetle, and only really came across Reyes version during the Infinite Crisis story arc. However, what I know is that this was an opportunity for DC to craft their own Spider-Man like character (young, struggling with the hero life, and navigating family). Instead what we got was a movie which failed to create a visually striking environment (it tries from the title artwork, to the neon signs.... but doesn't have the character of the Guardians movies or Thor: Ragnarok), fails to give us original characters and see their development (we get pared down version of the characters from Shang-Chi and Ant-Man), gives us the most one-dimensional bad guy since Iron Man 1, and ludicrous dialogue throughout.<br><br>The movie feels like someone decided to make a superhero tele-novela.<br><br>I wish it wasn't so. I wanted this to be great, and there are hints of it, like in the first transformation scene. But overall it felt like a script written by someone without deep love of the characters, and a cinematographer + director that thought throwing some neon in would make it edgy.",4
" Absolute Fun and Distinctly Entertaining
","It's not an origin story but more of the passing of a mantle story. It will make you smile, laugh and a bit sad. Excellent pacing between dramedy, grim moments and action with emphasis on drama. The emphasis on drama and character makes the action and adventure more impactful. The narrative is surprisingly layered. One could say that marketing failed this film but on the flip side it's greatly appreciated that it's marketing didn't spoil the greater moments in the film.<br><br>The movie really does connect to viewers at varying degrees. Viewers unable to put themselves in others shoes (lacking imagination) will not relate. At the risk of a spoiler, one example of a well written and layered scene, is that of a family under siege in their home. On the surface it's generic group of mercenaries terrorizing innocent people. But at deeper level it represents a nightmare scenario, unfortunately not exclusive to the Mexican American experience. The fear of a family being separated by force.<br><br>Despite the above it's a wonderfully optimistic and fun ride that deals with love and loss and the strength to overcome any challenges.",10
" The Reason
","This movie is a great example of why Marvel does movies better. I guess because the writers are on strike the movie was not great? They could have did the storyline a million times better. Acting was ok. I thought Karate Kid could have done better but I still blame the writers. George Lopez was George Lopez. The comedy was subpar. The decision making sometimes was questionable. A lot of why would he do that kind of moments. But 1 part that made no sense was when his uncle was getting shot at and instead of BB just breaking the gun that the bad guy had, he let's him up and runs toward his uncle. He almost got him killed if anything!",6
" Best Recent DC Movie - Heart & Humor
","It makes me so sad to see so many negative reviews for this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I laughed a lot and even cried a little bit. Xolo is a stand out and I hope to see more of him in this role. The entire Reyes family was fantastic and really drew me in. The cast has a great and very believable family dynamic. It's also nice to see a movie with scenes in bright daylight and with pops of color, since a lot of movies now are very dark and beige. There's a lot of heart in this film and that constantly shines through. I highly recommend it (especially if you like the tone of Tom Holland's Spider-Man films).",8
" Fun movie but falls short of its competition in the marvel universe.
","Is this a dud? No, in comparison to the rest of the DC universe films. Ticks the boxes for a fun rainy day movie. Nothing of substance to warrant a repeat viewing like so many of the Marvel universe films. Some strange social messaging blended in that just falls short of any point. Boilerplate superhero movie plot with unsatisfying resolve. Better than Aquaman so it has that going for it. At least its a fresh hero added to the universe and as a JLE fan would like to see characters from that division be explored more. Booster Gold would have been a nice cameo. Not sure why DC struggles so much with their movies but this one fell short with some real potiental. Disapointed but caught it for 5 bucks at AMC so cant complain for 2 hours spent.",4
" Good start and a refresher...
","With all of the bad movies that have been released lately in the superhero genre, this one was actually a breath of fresh air. Yes, it was slightly predictable. Yes the acting wasn't perfect. It was just fun. A good amount of action and humor. It kind of gave me the vibe of Iron Man mixed with Ant-Man. I know there is a lot of hatred going on about this movie but I would say you should see it. If DC can build off this movie, it could be a good start to the new universe. I'm sure my 9 out of 10 is going to be looked at and criticized, but the movie deserves another run at a sequel. For this of us who have not actually read the comics, this was cool to see something that was not already main stream like Superman.",9
" A good introduction movie
",Like every superhero movie it has its pros and cons but I will say that it is a good introduction movie for the character Blue Beetle. I do like Xolo being casted as Blue Beetle and I feel like the story line is buildable. It was not the best superhero movie ever but it wasn't bad I truly think in my opinion it's a good introduction movie to the character. This was a good movie to make the second part even better if the decide to move forward with a second part. I really liked the family dynamic and how close they are throughout the movie. Xolo and George Lopez were my favorite characters. I'm really into comics but never got into Blue Beetle I am hoping to get some comics and really dive into the story line.,8
